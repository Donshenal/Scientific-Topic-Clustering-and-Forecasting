Title,Abstract,Published Date
"First Detection of Near-Infrared Intraday Variations in the Seyfert 1
  Nucleus NGC4395","We carried out a one-night optical V and near-infrared JHK monitoring
observation of the least luminous Seyfert 1 galaxy, NGC4395, on 2004 May 1, and
detected for the first time the intraday flux variations in the J and H bands,
while such variation was not clearly seen for the K band. The detected J and H
variations are synchronized with the flux variation in the V band, which
indicates that the intraday-variable component of near-infrared continuum
emission of the NGC4395 nucleus is an extension of power-law continuum emission
to the near-infrared and originates in an outer region of the central accretion
disk. On the other hand, from our regular program of long-term optical BVI and
near-infrared JHK monitoring observation of NGC4395 from 2004 February 12 until
2005 January 22, we found large flux variations in all the bands on time scales
of days to months. The optical BVI variations are almost synchronized with each
other, but not completely with the near-infrared JHK variations. The color
temperature of the near-infrared variable component is estimated to be
T=1320-1710 K, in agreement with thermal emission from hot dust tori in active
galactic nuclei (AGNs). We therefore conclude that the near-infrared variation
consists of two components having different time scales, so that a small K-flux
variation on a time scale of a few hours would possibly be veiled by large
variation of thermal dust emission on a time scale of days.",2006-04-08T10:06:17Z
"Probing Dynamics of Dark Energy with Supernova, Galaxy Clustering and
  the Three-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations","Using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method we perform a global analysis
constraining the dynamics of dark energy in light of the supernova (Riess
""Gold"" samples), galaxy clustering (SDSS 3D power spectra and SDSS lyman-\alpha
forest information) and the latest three-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
Probe (WMAP) observations. We have allowed the dark energy equation of state to
get across -1 and pay particular attention to the effects when incorrectly
neglecting dark energy perturbations. We find the parameter space of dynamical
dark energy is now well constrained and neglecting dark energy perturbations
will make the parameter space significantly smaller. Dynamical dark energy
model where the equation of state crosses -1 is mildly favored and the standard
\LambdaCDM model is still a good fit to the current data.",2006-03-23T17:42:26Z
Probing the Environment with Galaxy Dynamics,"I present various projects to study the halo dynamics of elliptical galaxies.
This allows one to study the outer mass and orbital distributions of
ellipticals in different environments, and the inner distributions of groups
and clusters themselves.",2006-05-02T15:28:39Z
"A search for a counterpart of the unidentified gamma-ray source 3EG
  J2020+4017 (2CG078+2)","We report observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory of a field in the
gamma$-Cygni supernova remnant (SNR78.2+2.1) centered on the cataloged location
of the unidentified, bright gamma-ray source 3EG J2020+4017. In this search for
an X-ray counterpart to the gamma-ray source, we detected 30 X-ray sources. Of
these, we found 17 strong-candidate counterparts in optical (visible through
near-infrared) cataloged and an additional 3 through our optical observations.
Based upon colors and (for several objects) optical spectra, nearly all the
optically identified objects appear to be reddened main-sequence stars. None of
the X-ray sources with an optical counterpart is a plausible X-ray counterpart
to 3EG J2020+4017 --if that gamma-ray source is a spin-powered pulsar. Many of
the 10 X-ray sources lacking optical counterparts are likely (extragalactic)
active galactic nuclei, based upon the sky density of such sources. Although
one of the 10 optically unidentified X-ray sources could be the gamma-ray
source, there is no auxiliary evidence supporting such an identification.",2006-06-23T17:41:35Z
"Extragalactic chemistry of molecular gas: lessons from the local
  universe","Observational constraints provided by high resolution and high sensitivity
observations of external galaxies made in the millimeter and submillimeter
range have started to put on a firm ground the study of extragalactic chemistry
of molecular gas. In particular, the availability of multi-species and
multi-line surveys of nearby galaxies is central to the interpretation of
existent and forthcoming millimeter observations of the high redshift universe.
Probing the physical and chemical status of molecular gas in starbursts and
active galaxies (AGN) requires the use of specific tracers of the relevant
energetic phenomena that are known to be at play in these galaxies: large-scale
shocks, strong UV fields, cosmic rays and X-rays. We present below the first
results of an ongoing survey, allying the IRAM 30m telescope with the Plateau
de Bure interferometer(PdBI), devoted to study the chemistry of molecular gas
in a sample of starbursts and AGN of the local universe. These observations
highlight the existence of a strong chemical differentiation in the molecular
disks of starbursts and AGN.",2006-05-24T11:41:23Z
Slow evolution of elliptical galaxies induced by dynamical friction,"Many astrophysical problems, ranging from structure formation in cosmology to
dynamics of elliptical galaxies, refer to slow processes of evolution of
essentially collisionless self-gravitating systems. In order to determine the
relevant quasi-equilibrium configuration at time t from given initial
conditions, it is often argued that such slow evolution may be approximated in
terms of adiabatic evolution, for the calculation of which efficient
semi--analytical techniques are available. Here we focus on the slow process of
evolution, induced by dynamical friction of a host stellar system on a minority
component of ""satellites"", that we have investigated in a previous paper, to
determine to what extent an adiabatic description might be applied. The study
is realized by comparing directly N--body simulations of the stellar system
evolution (in two significantly different models) from initial to final
conditions in a controlled numerical environment. We demonstrate that for the
examined process the adiabatic description is going to provide incorrect
answers, not only quantitatively, but also qualitatively. The two classes of
models considered exhibit generally similar trends in evolution, with one
exception noted in relation to the evolution of the total density profile. This
simple conclusion should be taken as a warning against the indiscriminate use
of adiabatic growth prescriptions in studies of structure of galaxies.",2006-03-18T12:42:59Z
"SCUBA-2: a 10,000 pixel submillimeter camera for the James Clerk Maxwell
  Telescope","SCUBA-2 is an innovative 10,000 pixel submillimeter camera due to be
delivered to the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in late 2006. The camera is
expected to revolutionize submillimeter astronomy in terms of the ability to
carry out wide-field surveys to unprecedented depths addressing key questions
relating to the origins of galaxies, stars and planets. This paper presents an
update on the project with particular emphasis on the laboratory commissioning
of the instrument. The assembly and integration will be described as well as
the measured thermal performance of the instrument. A summary of the
performance results will be presented from the TES bolometer arrays, which come
complete with in-focal plane SQUID amplifiers and multiplexed readouts, and are
cooled to 100mK by a liquid cryogen-free dilution refrigerator. Considerable
emphasis has also been placed on the operating modes of the instrument and the
common-user aspect of the user interface and data reduction pipeline. These
areas will also be described in the paper.",2006-06-14T11:09:57Z
"On the Age and Metallicity Estimation of Spiral Galaxies Using Optical
  and Near-Infrared Photometry","In integrated-light, some color-color diagrams that use optical and
near-infrared photometry show surprisingly orthogonal grids as age and
metallicity are varied, and they are coming into common usage for estimating
the average age and metallicity of spiral galaxies. In this paper we
reconstruct these composite grids using simple stellar population models from
several different groups convolved with some plausible functional forms of star
formation histories at fixed metallicity. We find that the youngest populations
present (t<2 Gyr) dominate the light, and because of their presence the
age-metallicity degeneracy can be partially broken with broad-band colors,
unlike older populations. The scatter among simple stellar population models by
different authors is, however, large at ages t<2 Gyr. The dominant
uncertainties in stellar population models arise from convective core overshoot
assumptions and the treatment of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch
phase and helium abundance may play a significant role at higher metallicities.
Real spiral galaxies are unlikely to have smooth, exponential star formation
histories, and burstiness will cause a partial reversion to the single-burst
case, which has even larger model-to-model scatter. Finally, it is emphasized
that the current composite stellar population models need some implementation
of chemical enrichment histories for the proper analysis of the observational
data.",2006-05-17T19:29:41Z
Dwarf novae in the Hamburg Quasar Survey: Rarer than expected,"We report the discovery of five new dwarf novae from the Hamburg Quasar
Survey (HQS), and discuss the properties of the sample of dwarf novae in the
HQS. The orbital periods of the new dwarf novae are ~105.1 min or ~109.9 min,
114.3+-2.7 min, 92.66+-0.17 min, 272.317+-0.001 min, 258.02+-0.56 min for
HS0417+7445, HS1016+3412, HS1340+1524, HS1857+7127, and HS2214+2845,
respectively. HS1857+7127 is found to be partially eclipsing. In HS2214+2845
the secondary star of spectral type M3+-1 is clearly detected, and we estimate
the distance to the system to be d=390+-40 pc. We recorded one superoutburst of
the SU UMa system HS0417+7445. HS1016+3412 and HS1340+1524 have rare outbursts,
and their subtype is yet undetermined. HS1857+7127 frequently varies in
brightness and may be a Z Cam-type dwarf nova. HS2214+2845 is a U Gem-type
dwarf nova with a most likely cycle length of 71 d. To date, 14 new dwarf novae
have been identified in the HQS. The ratio of short-period (<3 h) to
long-period (>3 h) systems of this sample is 1.3, much smaller compared to the
ratio of 2.7 found for all known dwarf novae. The HQS dwarf novae display
typically infrequent or low-amplitude outburst activity, underlining the
strength of spectroscopic selection in identifying new CVs independently of
their variability. The spectroscopic properties of short-period CVs in the HQS
suggest that most of them are still evolving towards the minimum period. Their
total number agrees with the predictions of population models within an order
of magnitude. However, the bulk of all CVs is predicted to have evolved past
the minimum period, and those systems remain unidentified. Those post-bounce
systems may have markedly weaker Hbeta emission lines compared to the average
known short-period CVs, and probably undergo no or extremely rare outbursts.",2006-05-23T14:06:20Z
Physics of Strongly Magnetized Neutron Stars,"There has recently been growing evidence for the existence of neutron stars
possessing magnetic fields with strengths that exceed the quantum critical
field strength of $4.4 \times 10^{13}$ G, at which the cyclotron energy equals
the electron rest mass. Such evidence has been provided by new discoveries of
radio pulsars having very high spin-down rates and by observations of bursting
gamma-ray sources termed magnetars. This article will discuss the exotic
physics of this high-field regime, where a new array of processes becomes
possible and even dominant, and where familiar processes acquire unusual
properties. We review the physical processes that are important in neutron star
interiors and magnetospheres, including the behavior of free particles, atoms,
molecules, plasma and condensed matter in strong magnetic fields, photon
propagation in magnetized plasmas, free-particle radiative processes, the
physics of neutron star interiors, and field evolution and decay mechanisms.
Application of such processes in astrophysical source models, including
rotation-powered pulsars, soft gamma-ray repeaters, anomalous X-ray pulsars and
accreting X-ray pulsars will also be discussed. Throughout this review, we will
highlight the observational signatures of high magnetic field processes, as
well as the theoretical issues that remain to be understood.",2006-06-28T19:08:16Z
Massive neutrinos and cosmology,"The present experimental results on neutrino flavour oscillations provide
evidence for non-zero neutrino masses, but give no hint on their absolute mass
scale, which is the target of beta decay and neutrinoless double-beta decay
experiments. Crucial complementary information on neutrino masses can be
obtained from the analysis of data on cosmological observables, such as the
anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background or the distribution of
large-scale structure. In this review we describe in detail how free-streaming
massive neutrinos affect the evolution of cosmological perturbations. We
summarize the current bounds on the sum of neutrino masses that can be derived
from various combinations of cosmological data, including the most recent
analysis by the WMAP team. We also discuss how future cosmological experiments
are expected to be sensitive to neutrino masses well into the sub-eV range.",2006-03-20T10:19:09Z
"Semi-empirical analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies III. How to
  distinguish AGN hosts","We consider the techniques to distinguish normal star forming (NSF) galaxies
and active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosts using optical spectra. The observational
data base is a set of 20000 galaxies extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey, for which we have determined the emission line intensities after
subtracting the stellar continuum obtained from spectral synthesis. Our
analysis is based on photoionization models computed using the stellar ionizing
radiation predicted by Starburst 99 and, for the AGNs, a broken power-law
spectrum. We explain why, among the four classical emission line diagnostic
diagrams, the [OIII]/Hb vs [NII]/Ha one works best. We show however, that none
of these diagrams is efficient in detecting AGNs in metal poor galaxies, should
such cases exist. We propose a new divisory line between ``pure'' NSF galaxies
and AGN hosts. We also show that a classification into NSF and AGN galaxies
using only [NII]/Ha is feasible and useful. Finally, we propose a new
classification diagram, the DEW diagram, plotting D_n(4000) vs
max(EW[OII],EW[NeIII]). This diagram can be used with optical spectra for
galaxies with redshifts up to z = 1.3, meaning an important progress over
classifications proposed up to now. Since the DEW diagram requires only a small
range in wavelength, it can also be used at even larger redshifts in suitable
atmospheric windows. It also has the advantage of not requiring stellar
synthesis analysis to subtract the stars and of allowing one to see ALL the
galaxies in the same diagram, including passive galaxies.",2006-06-29T14:39:20Z
"The star formation rate at redshift one: H-alpha spectroscopy with
  CIRPASS","We have conducted an H-alpha survey of 38 0.77<z<1 galaxies over ~100
arcmin^2 of the Hubble Deep Field North and Flanking Fields, to determine star
formation rates (SFRs), with the near-infrared multi-object spectrograph
CIRPASS on the WHT. This represents the first successful application of this
technique to observing high redshift galaxies. Stacking the spectra in the
rest-frame to infer a total SFR for the field, we find a lower limit
(uncorrected for dust reddening) on the star formation rate density at redshift
z = 1 of 0.04Msol/yr/Mpc^3. This implies rapid evolution in the star formation
rate density from z = 0 to z = 1 which is proportional to (1+z)^{3.1}.",2006-04-27T21:16:23Z
Mass-loss properties of S-stars on the AGB,"We have used a detailed non-LTE radiative transfer code to model new APEX
CO(J=3-2) data, and existing CO radio line data, on a sample of 40 AGB S-stars.
The derived mass-loss-rate distribution has a median value of 2E-7 Msun/yr, and
resembles values obtained for similar samples of M-stars and carbon stars.
Possibly, there is a scarcity of high-mass-loss-rate (>=1E-5 Msun/yr) S-stars.
The distribution of envelope gas expansion velocities is similar to that of the
M-stars, the median is 7.5 km/s, while the carbon stars, in general, have
higher gas expansion velocities. The mass-loss rate correlates well with the
gas expansion velocity, in accordance with results for M-stars and carbon
stars.",2006-05-26T13:54:47Z
Dynamics and Shape of Brightest Cluster Galaxies,"We identified Brightest Cluster Members (BCM) on DSS images of 1083 Abell
clusters, derived their individual and host cluster redshifts from literature
and determined the BCM ellipticity. Half the BCMs move at a speed higher than
37 % of the cluster velocity dispersion sigma_{cl}, suggesting that most BCMs
are part of substructures falling into the main cluster. Both, the BCM's
velocity offset in units of sigma_{cl}, and BCM ellipticity, weakly decrease
with cluster richness.",2006-03-12T23:29:40Z
The faint afterglow and host galaxy of the short-hard GRB 060121,"We present optical and X-ray observations of the afterglow and host galaxy of
the short-hard GRB 060121. The faint R-band afterglow is seen to decline as
t^(-0.66) while the X-ray falls as t^-1.18, indicating the presence of the
cooling break between the two frequencies. However, the R-band afterglow is
very faint compared to the predicted extrapolation of the X-ray afterglow to
the optical regime (specifically, beta_OX ~ 0.2), while the K-band is
consistent with this extrapolation (beta_KX ~ 0.6), demonstrating suppression
of the optical flux. Late time {\it HST} observations place stringent limits on
the afterglow R-band flux implying a break in the R-band lightcurve. They also
show that the burst occurred at the edge of a faint red galaxy which most
likely lies at a significantly higher redshift than the previous optically
identified short-duration bursts. Several neighboring galaxies also have very
red colors that are similarly suggestive of higher redshift. We consider
possible explanations for the faintness and color of the burst. Our preferred
model is that the burst occurred at moderately high redshift and was
significantly obscured; however, it is also possible that the burst lies at z >
4.5 in which case the faintness of the R-band afterglow could be attributed to
the Lyman-break. We discuss the implications that either scenario would have
for the nature of the progenitors of short bursts.",2006-03-11T15:15:38Z
Evidence for precession of the isolated neutron star RX J0720.4-3125,"The XMM-Newton spectra of the isolated neutron star RX J0720.4-3125 obtained
over 4.5 years can be described by sinusoidal variations in the inferred
blackbody temperature, the size of the emitting area and the depth of the
absorption line with a period of 7.1 +/- 0.5 years, which we suggest to be the
precession period of the neutron star. Precession of a neutron star with two
hot spots of different temperature and size, probably not located exactly in
antipodal positions, may account for the variations in the X-ray spectra,
changes in the pulsed fraction, shape of the light curve and the phase-lag
between soft and hard energy bands observed from RX J0720.4-3125. An
independent sinusoidal fit to published and new pulse timing residuals from a
coherent analysis covering ~12 years yields a consistent period of 7.7 +/- 0.6
years supporting the precession model.",2006-03-27T15:04:09Z
Oscillations in the stable starless core Barnard 68,"New molecular line observations of the Bok globule Barnard 68 in HCO+
irrefutably confirm the complex pattern of red and blue asymmetric line
profiles seen across the face of the cloud in previous observations of CS. The
new observations thus strengthen the previous interpretation that Barnard 68 is
undergoing peculiar oscillations. Furthermore, the physical chemistry of B68
indicates that the object is much older than the sound crossing time and is
therefore long-lived. A model is presented for the globule in which a modest
external pressure perturbation is shown to lead to oscillations about a stable
equilibrium configuration. Such oscillations may be present in other stable
starless cores as manifested by a similar signature of inward and outward
motions.",2006-04-04T14:17:30Z
Energy transfer by the scattering of resonant photons,"A formal derivation is presented of the energy transfer rate between
radiation and matter due to the scattering of an isotropic distribution of
resonant photons. The derivation is developed in the context of the two-level
atom in the absence of collisions and radiative transitions to and from the
continuum, but includes the full angle-averaged redistribution function for
photon scattering. The result is compared with previous derivations, all of
which have been based on the Fokker-Planck approximation to the radiative
transfer equation. A new Fokker-Planck approximation, including an extension to
higher (post-diffusive) orders, is derived to solve the radiative transfer
equation, and time-dependent numerical solutions are found. The relaxation of
the colour temperature to the matter temperature is computed as the radiation
field approaches statistical equilibrium through scattering. The results are
discussed in the context of the Wouthuysen-Field mechanism for coupling the
21cm spin temperature of neutral hydrogen to the kinetic temperature of the gas
through LyA scattering. The evolution of the heating rate is also computed, and
shown to diminish as the gas approaches statistical equilibrium.",2006-03-31T16:11:40Z
"The Variability and Rotation of Pre-main Sequence Stars in IC 348: Does
  Intracluster Environment Influence Stellar Rotation?","A variability study of the young cluster IC 348 at Van Vleck Observatory has
been extended to a total of seven years. Twelve new periodic stars have been
found in the last two years, bringing the total discovered by this program to
40. In addition, we confirm 16 of the periods reported by others and resolve
some discrepancies. The total number of known rotation periods in the cluster,
from all studies has now reached 70. This is sufficient to demonstrate that the
parent population of K5-M2 stars is rotationally indistinguishable from that in
the Orion Nebula Cluster even though their radii are 20% smaller and they would
be expected to spin about twice as fast if angular momentum were conserved. The
median radius and, therefore, inferred age of the IC 348 stars actually closely
matches that of NGC 2264, but the stars spin significantly more slowly. This
suggests that another factor besides mass and age plays a role in establishing
the rotation properties within a cluster and we suggest that it is environment.
If disk locking were to persist for longer times in less harsh environments,
because the disks themselves persist for longer times, it could explain the
generally slower rotation rates observed for stars in this cluster, whose
earliest type star is of class B5. We have also obtained radial velocities, the
first for PMS stars in IC348, and v sin i measurements for 30 cluster stars to
assist in the study of rotation and as an independent check on stellar radii.
Several unusual variable stars are discussed; in some or all cases their
behavior may be linked to occultations by circumstellar material. A strong
correlation exists between the range of photometric variability and the slope
of the spectral energy distribution in the infrared. Nineteen of the 21 stars
with I ranges exceeding 0.4 mag show infrared evidence for circumstellar disks.",2006-06-18T13:31:09Z
"The galaxy-galaxy lensing contribution to the cosmic shear two point
  function","We note that galaxy-galaxy lensing by non-spherical galaxy halos produces a
net anti-correlation between the shear of background galaxies and the
ellipticity of foreground galaxies. This anti-correlation would contaminate the
tomographic cosmic shear two point function if the effect were not taken into
account. We compare the size of the galaxy-galaxy lensing contribution to the
change in the cosmic shear two-point correlation function due to a change in
the dark energy equation of state w of 1%. We find them comparable on scales
<~5 arcmin for NFW galaxy profiles, and out to much larger scales for SIE
profiles. However the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal has a characteristic spatial
and redshift pattern which should allow it to be removed.",2006-08-01T19:19:51Z
"Acoustic oscillations of rapidly rotating polytropic stars. II. Effects
  of the Coriolis and centrifugal accelerations","Context: With the launch of space missions devoted to asteroseismology (like
COROT), the scientific community will soon have accurate measurements of
pulsation frequencies in many rapidly rotating stars.
  Aims: The present work focuses on the effects of rotation on pulsations of
rapidly rotating stars when both the Coriolis and centrifugal accelerations
require a non-perturbative treatment.
  Method: We develop a 2-dimensional spectral numerical approach which allows
us to compute acoustic modes in centrifugally distorted polytropes including
the full influence of the Coriolis force. This method is validated through
comparisons with previous studies, and the results are shown to be highly
accurate.
  Results: In the frequency range considered and with COROT's accuracy, we
establish a domain of validity for perturbative methods, thus showing the need
for complete calculations beyond v.sin i = 50 km/s for a R = 2.3 R_\odot, M =
1.9 M_\odot polytropic star. Furthermore, it is shown that the main differences
between complete and perturbative calculations come essentially from the
centrifugal distortion.",2006-05-19T16:33:36Z
"Bringing VY Canis Majoris Down to Size: An Improved Determination of Its
  Effective Tempeature","The star VY CMa is a late-type M supergiant with many peculiarities, mostly
related to the intense circumstellar environment due to the star's high
mass-loss rate. Claims have been made that would suggest this star is
considerably more luminous (L = 5 x 10^5 Lo) and larger (R=2800 Ro) than other
Galactic red supergiants (RSGs). Indeed, such a location in the H-R diagram
would be well in the ""Hayashi forbidden zone"" where stars cannot be in
hydrostatic equilibrium. These extraordinary properties, however, rest upon an
assumed effective temperature of 2800-3000 K, far cooler than recent work have
shown RSGs to be. To obtain a better estimate, we fit newly obtained
spectrophotometry in the optical and NIR with the same MARCS models used for
our recent determination of the physical properties of other RSGs; we also use
$V-K$ and $V-J$ from the literature to derive an effective temperatures. We
find that the star likely has a temperature of 3650 K, a luminosity L = 6 x
10^4 Lo, and a radius of 600Ro. These values are consistent with VY CMa being
an ordinary evolved 15 Mo RSG, and agree well with the Geneva evolutionary
tracks. We find that the circumstellar dust region has a temperature of 760 K,
and an effective radius of approximately 130 AU, if spherical geometry is
assumed for the latter. What causes this star to have such a high mass-loss,
and large variations in brightness (but with little change in color), remains a
mystery at present, although we speculate that perhaps this star (and NML Cyg)
are simply normal RSGs caught during an unusually unstable time.",2006-04-11T21:06:10Z
"Comparison of the Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Ray Flux Observed by AGASA,
  HiRes and Auger","The current measurements of the cosmic ray energy spectrum at ultra-high
energies ($\text{E}>10^{19}$ eV) are characterized by large systematic errors
and poor statistics. In addition, the experimental results of the two
experiments with the largest published data sets, AGASA and HiRes, appear to be
inconsistent with each other, with AGASA seeing an unabated continuation of the
energy spectrum even at energies beyond the GZK cutoff energy at $10^{19.6}$
eV. Given the importance of the related astrophysical questions regarding the
unknown origin of these highly energetic particles, it is crucial that the
extent to which these measurements disagree be well understood. Here we
evaluate the consistency of the two measurements for the first time with a
model-independent method that accounts for the large statistical and systematic
errors of current measurements. We further compare the AGASA and HiRes spectra
with the recently presented Auger spectrum. The method directly compares two
measurements, bypassing the introduction of theoretical models for the shape of
the energy spectrum. The inconsistency between the observations is expressed in
terms of a Bayes Factor, a standard statistic defined as the ratio of a
separate parent source hypothesis to a single parent source hypothesis.
Application to the data shows that the two-parent hypothesis is disfavored. We
expand the method to allow comparisons between an experimental flux and that
predicted by any model.",2006-06-14T14:31:47Z
"Velocity Curves for Stars in Disk Galaxies: A case for Nearly Newtonian
  Dynamics","The dark matter constraint imposed by the recent WMAP experiment on
gravitational theories is analyzed. Using the non-linearity of the vacuum
Einstein's equations, it is shown that when the slow motion condition is
applied to the geodesic equations, the resulting nearly Newtonian gravitational
field describes nearly flat velocity curves for rotating stars in the vicinity
of thin disk galaxies.",2006-05-28T14:29:33Z
"Physical Origin of the Quadrupole Out-of-Plane Magnetic Field in
  Hall-MHD Reconnection","A quadrupole pattern of the out-of-plane component of the magnetic field
inside a reconnection region is seen as an important signature of the
Hall-magnetohydrodynamic (Hall-MHD) regime of reconnection. It has been first
observed in numerical simulations and just recently confirmed in the MRX
(Magnetic Reconnection Experiment) [M. Yamada, H. Ji, S. Hsu, T. Carter, R.
Kulsrud, N. Bertz, F. Jobes, Y. Ono, and F. Perkins, Phys. Plasmas 4, 1936
(1997)] and also seen in spacecraft observations of Earth's magnetosphere. In
this study, the physical origin of the quadrupole field is analyzed and traced
to a current of electrons that flows along the lines in and out of the inner
reconnection region to maintain charge neutrality. The role of the quadrupole
magnetic field in the overall dynamics of the reconnection process is
discussed. In addition, the bipolar poloidal electric field is estimated and
its effect on ion motions is emphasized.",2006-05-12T00:39:35Z
The Evolution of Outflow-Envelope Interactions in Low-Mass Protostars,"We present multi-line and continuum observations of the circumstellar
environment within 10^4 AU of a sample of protostars to investigate how the
effects of outflows on their immediate environment changes over time. 12CO(1-0)
emission probes the high-velocity molecular outflows near the protostars and
demonstrate that the outflow opening angle widens as the nascent star evolves.
Maps of the 13CO(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) outflow emission show that protostellar
winds erode the circumstellar envelope through the entrainment of the outer
envelope gas. The spatial and velocity distribution of the dense circumstellar
envelope, as well as its mass, is traced by the C18O(1-0) emission and also
displays evolutionary changes. We show that outflows are largely responsible
for these changes, and propose an empirical model for the evolution of
outflow-envelope interactions. In addition, some of the outflows in our sample
appear to affect the chemical composition of the surrounding environment,
enhancing the HCO+ abundance. Overall, our results confirm that outflows play a
major role in the star formation process through their strong physical and

High resolution infrared spectroscopy of the old open cluster NGC6791,"We report abundance analysis for 6 M giant members of the old open cluster
NGC6791, based on infrared spectroscopy (1.5-1.8 micron) at R=25,000, using the
NIRSPEC spectrograph at the Keck II telescope. We find the iron abundance
<[Fe/H]>= +0.35 +/- 0.02$, confirming the super solar metallicity of this
cluster derived from optical medium-high resolution spectroscopy. We also
measure C, O and other alpha element abundances, finding roughly solar
[alpha/Fe] and <[C/Fe]> = -0.35. Our approach constrains [O/Fe] especially
well, based on the measurement of a number of OH lines near 1.6micron; we find
[O/Fe]=-0.07 +/-0.03. The Solar alpha enhancement is in contrast to the
composition of similar stars in the Galactic bulge. We also find low
12C/13C~10, confirming the presence of extra-mixing processes during the red
giant phase of evolution, up to super solar metallicities.",2006-04-03T14:20:08Z
Testing the BH 176 and Berkeley 29 Association with GASS/Monoceros,"It has been previously noted that the outermost open clusters in the Milky
Way seem to lie in a string-like configuration that is coincident with, and may
be associated to, the Galactic anticenter stellar structure (GASS) or the
``Monoceros Ring''. Among the clusters that have been suggested to be
associated with GASS are Berkeley 29 (Be29) and BH176, which have recently had
their proper motion determined. Matching the new proper motion determinations
to previously published radial velocities, we attempt to derive orbits for Be29
and BH176. The preliminary orbit for Be29 provides tantalizing evidence for a
non-standard formation, however better proper motions are needed to determine
whether its origin is due to normal formation or accretion.",2006-04-06T14:11:11Z
Neutrino Astronomy and Cosmic Rays Spectroscopy at Horizons,"A new air-showering physics may rise in next years at horizon, offering at
different angles and altitudes a fine tuned filtered Cosmic Rays astrophysics
and an upward Neutrino induced air-showering astronomy. Most of this
opportunity arises because of neutrino masses, their mixing and the consequent
replenishment of rarest tau flavor during its flight in Space. Horizontal air
atmosphere act as a filter for High energy Cosmic Rays (CR) and as a beam dump
for Ultra High Energy (UHE) neutrinos and a powerfull amplifier for its tau
decay in air by its wide showering areas. Earth sharp shadows plays the role of
a huge detector volume for UHE neutrino and a noise-free screen for upcoming
EeVs tau air-showers (as well PeVs anti-neutrino electron air interactions).
Projects for Tau Airshowers are growing at the top of a mountains or at the
edge of a cliff. ASHRA in Hawaii and CRNTN in Utah are tracking fluorescence
lights, while other novel projects on Crown array detectors on mountains, on
balloons and satellites are elaborated for Cherenkov lights. AUGER, facing the
Ande edges, ARGO located within a deep valley are testing inclined showers;
MILAGRO (and MILAGRITO) may be triggered by horizontal up-going muon bundles
from the Earth edges; HIRES and AUGER UHECR detectors, linking twin array
telescopes along their axis may test horizontal Cerenkov blazing photons. MAGIC
(Hess, Veritas) and Shalon Telescopes may act already like a detector for few
PeVs and Glashow resonance neutrino events; MAGIC pointing downward to
terrestrial ground acts as a massive tens of km^3 detector, making it the most
sensitive dedicated neutrino telescope. MAGIC facing the sea edges must reveal
mirrored downward UHECR Air-showers Cherenkov flashes. Magic-crown systems may
lead to tens km^3, neutrino detectors.",2006-04-20T14:17:09Z
Cosmological Constraints from Hubble Parameter versus Redshift Data,"We use the Simon, Verde, & Jimenez (2005) determination of the redshift
dependence of the Hubble parameter to constrain cosmological parameters in
three dark energy cosmological models. We consider the standard $\Lambda$CDM
model, the XCDM parameterization of the dark energy equation of state, and a
slowly rolling dark energy scalar field with an inverse power-law potential.
The constraints are restrictive, consistent with those derived from Type Ia
supernova redshift-magnitude data, and complement those from galaxy cluster gas
mass fraction versus redshift data.",2006-07-13T18:32:47Z
"Photometric survey of marginally investigated open clusters: I. Basel
  11b, King 14, Czernik 43","To progress in galactic studies based on open clusters, e.g. cluster
formation rate or kinematical properties, one needs to improve the number of
open clusters observed. However, only half of the 1700 known galactic open
clusters have been properly observed so far, making any statistical
investigation insignificant, especially at larger distances from the Sun. We
study marginally investigated or neglected open clusters with Bessell CCD BVR
photometry, whose data were used to fit isochrones to the individual
color-magnitude diagrams. We examined the galactic clusters Basel 11b, King 14
and Czernik 43, the last being observed for the first time to this extent. As
well as a careful comparison to available photometry, their parameters such as
age, interstellar reddening, distance and apparent diameter were determined.
The obtained cluster properties were verified by near infrared 2MASS data. The
three investigated intermediate age clusters are all located in the galactic
disk with distances between 1.8 and 3.0kpc from the Sun.",2006-04-12T10:33:35Z

Timing properties of XB 1254-690,"We analyze archival Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) Proportional Counter
Array (PCA) data of the low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) system XB 1254-690. We
calculate colour-colour diagram, hardness-intensity diagram and power spectra
of this source, associate its broad low-frequency timing features with the
portions of the colour-colour diagram, and establish that XB 1254-690 is an
atoll source. This will be important to correlate the timing and spectral
features of this dipping LMXB with its various states, which may be useful to
understand LMXBs in general. We find the source always in the high intensity
banana state, which may explain why ~ 1 Hz ""dipper QPOs"" have never been
observed from XB 1254-690. We also report a suggestive evidence of millisecond
period brightness oscillations at the frequency ~ 95 Hz during a thermonuclear

Galactic Warp in the overdensity of the Canis Major Region,"Bellazzini et al. (2006b) claim that Lopez-Corredoira et al.'s (2002) warp
model is totally unable to reproduce the Canis Major structure in the red clump
stars. However, slight variations in the azimuth of the Lopez-Corredoira et al.
(2002) warp model, justified by the uncertainties in the parameter as well as
the local irregularities with respect to the average model, derive a result
much closer to the observations of the overdensity south/north. The bump of red
clump stars with m_K=13-13.5 around l=241 deg., b=-8.5 deg. and the depth of
the Canis Major structure are also explainable in terms of the warp with an
appropriate extrapolation of constant height between galactocentric radii of 13
and 16 kpc, as observed roughly in the southern warp, instead of a
monotonically increasing height like the northern warp; and the observed
velocity distribution of stars cannot exclude the warp possibility. A warp
model is therefore still a possible explanation of the Canis Major overdensity,
and the hypothesis of the existence of a dwarf galaxy is unnecessary, although
still a possibility too.",2006-04-11T13:12:02Z

"V4745 Sgr -- a nova above the period gap and an intermediate polar
  candidate","A period analysis of CCD unfiltered photometry of V4745 Sgr (Nova Sgr 2003
#1) performed during 23 nights in the years 2003 - 2005 is presented. The
photometric data are modulated with a period of 0.20782 +- 0.00003 d ($4.98768
+- 0.00072 h). Following the shape of the phased light curve and the presence
of the periodicity in all data sets with no apparent change in its value, we
interpret this periodicity as orbital in nature and this is consistent with a
cataclysmic variable above the period gap. We found a probable short-term
periodicity of 0.017238 +- 0.000037 d (24.82272 +- 0.05328 m) which we
interpret as the probable spin period of the white dwarf or the beat period
between the orbital and spin period. Therefore, we propose that nova V4745 Sgr
should be classified as an intermediate polar candidate, supporting the
proposed link between transition-oscillation novae and intermediate polars. The
mass-period relation for cataclysmic variables yields a secondary mass of about
0.52 +- 0.05 M_solar.",2006-05-22T10:23:36Z

On the Lyman-alpha and Lyman-beta lines in solar coronal streamers,"We investigate the formation of the H I Lyman-alpha and Lyman-beta lines in
an equatorial coronal streamer. Particular attention is paid to frequency
redistribution for the scattering of the incident radiation. The properties of
the spectral lines are studied. The coronal model is given by a global 2.5-D
three fluid solar wind model with alpha particles. The emergent intensities and
line profiles are calculated from the solution of the statistical equilibrium
and radiative transfer equations for an hydrogen atom with 11 energy levels
under non local thermodynamic equilibrium. The formation of the lines results
from radiative excitation, collisional excitation, and takes into account the
coupling with all other transitions between the hydrogen energy levels. We
present new estimates of the radiative and collisional contributions of the
Lyman line intensities within the streamer. It is also shown that within the
streamer, the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the Lyman-beta line is a
better indicator of the plasma temperature than that of Lyman-alpha. These
results show that care should be taken when inferring the proton temperature
from the Lyman-alpha line profile as observed in coronal streamers, e.g. by the
Ultraviolet Coronagraph Spectrometer or the Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of
Emitted Radiation experiments on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory.",2006-06-05T21:20:18Z
Magneto-convection in a sunspot umbra,"Results from a realistic simulation of 3D radiative magneto-convection in a
strong background magnetic field corresponding to the conditions in sunspot
umbrae are shown. The convective energy transport is dominated by narrow upflow
plumes with adjacent downflows, which become almost field-free near the surface
layers. The strong external magnetic field forces the plumes to assume a
cusp-like shape in their top parts, where the upflowing plasma loses its
buoyancy. The resulting bright features in intensity images correspond well (in
terms of brightness, size, and lifetime) to the observed umbral dots in the
central parts of sunspot umbrae. Most of the simulated umbral dots have a
horizontally elongated form with a central dark lane. Above the cusp, most
plumes show narrow upflow jets, which are driven by the pressure of the
piled-up plasma below. The large velocities and low field strengths in the
plumes are effectively screened from spectroscopic observation because the
surfaces of equal optical depth are locally elevated, so that spectral lines
are largely formed above the cusp. Our simulations demonstrate that nearly
field-free upflow plumes and umbral dots are a natural result of convection in
a strong, initially monolithic magnetic field.",2006-03-03T10:03:18Z
"Effects of Rotation on Thermal-Gravitational Instability in the
  Protogalactic Disk Environment","Thermal-gravitational instability (TGI) is studied in the protogalactic
environment. We extend our previous work, where we found that dense clumps
first form out of hot background gas by thermal instability and later a small
fraction of them grow to virialized clouds of mass M_c >~ 6X10^6 M_sun by
gravitational infall and merging. But these clouds have large angular momentum,
so they would be difficult, if not impossible, to further evolve into globular
clusters. In this paper, through three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations in
a uniformly rotating frame, we explore if the Coriolis force due to rotation in
protogalactic disk regions can hinder binary merging and reduce angular
momentum of the clouds formed. With rotation comparable to the Galactic
rotation at the Solar circle, the Coriolis force is smaller than the pressure
force during the early thermal instability stage. So the properties of clumps
formed by thermal instability are not affected noticeably by rotation, except
increased angular momentum. However, during later stage the Coriolis force
becomes dominant over the gravity, and hence the further growth to
gravitationally bound clouds by gravitational infall and merging is prohibited.
Our results show that the Coriolis force effectively destroys the picture of
cloud formation via TGI, rather than alleviate the problem of large angular
momentum.",2006-04-26T06:17:16Z
Clio: a 3-5 micron AO planet-finding camera,"Clio is an adaptive-optics camera mounted on the 6.5 meter MMT optimized for
diffraction-limited L' and M-band imaging over a ~15'' field. The instrument
was designed from the ground up with a large well-depth, fast readout thermal
infrared (~3-5 micron) 320 by 256 pixel InSb detector, cooled optics, and
associated focal plane and pupil masks (with the option for a coronograph) to
minimize the thermal background and maximize throughput. When coupled with the
MMT's adaptive secondary AO (two warm reflections) system's low thermal
background, this instrument is in a unique position to image nearby warm
planets, which are the brightest in the L' and M-band atmospheric windows. We
present the current status of this recently commissioned instrument that
performed exceptionally during first light. Our instrument sensitivities are
impressive and are sky background limited: for an hour of integration, we
obtain an L'-band 5 sigma detection limit of of 17.0 magnitudes (Strehl ~80%)
and an M-band limit of 14.5 (Strehl ~90%). Our M-band sensitivity is lower due
to the increase in thermal sky background. These sensitivities translate to
finding relatively young planets five times Jupiter mass at 10 pc within a few
AU of a star. Presently, a large Clio survey of nearby stellar systems is
underway including a search for planets around solar-type stars, M dwarfs, and
white dwarfs. Even with a null result, we can place strong constraints on
planet distribution models.",2006-06-06T21:43:43Z
"The Araucaria Project. An Accurate Distance to the Local Group Galaxy
  NGC 6822 from Near-Infrared Photometry of Cepheid Variables","We have measured near-infrared magnitudes in the J and K bands for 56 Cepheid
variables in the Local Group galaxy NGC 6822 with well-determined periods and
optical light curves in the V and I bands. Using the template light curve
approach of Soszynski, Gieren and Pietrzynski, accurate mean magnitudes were
obtained from these data which allowed us to determine with unprecedented
accuracy the distance to NGC 6822 from a multi-wavelength period-luminosity
solution in the VIJK bands. From our data, we obtain a distance to NGC 6822 of
(m-M)_{0} = 23.312 +- 0.021 (random error) mag, with an additional systematic
uncertainty of about 3 %. This distance value is tied to an assumed LMC
distance modulus of 18.50. From our multiwavelength approach, we find for the
total (average) reddening to the NGC 6822 Cepheids E(B-V) = 0.356 +- 0.013 mag,
which is in excellent agreement with a previous determination of McGonegal et
al. from near-infrared photometry and implies significant internal reddening of
the Cepheids in NGC 6822. Our present, definitive distance determination of NGC
6822 from Cepheids agrees within 2 % with the previous distance we had derived
from optical photometry alone, but has significantly reduced error bars.
  Our Cepheid distance to NGC 6822 is in excellent agreement with the recent
independent determination of Cioni and Habing from the I-band magnitude of the
tip of the red giant branch. It also agrees well, within the errors, with the
early determination of McGonegal et al. (1983) from random-phase H-band
photometry of nine Cepheids.",2006-05-09T12:41:05Z
Can the thermal instability drive turbulence?,"The thermal instability with a piecewise power law cooling function is
investigated using one- and three-dimensional simulations with periodic and
shearing-periodic boundary conditions in the presence of constant thermal
diffusion and kinematic viscosity coefficients. Consistent with earlier
findings, the flow behavior depends on the average density, <rho>. When
$\bra{\rho}$ is in the range 1-5 x 10^{-24} g cm^{-3} the system is unstable
and segregates into cool and warm phases with temperatures of roughly 100 and
10^4 K, respectively. However, in all cases the resulting average pressure <p>
is independent of <rho> and just a little above the minimum value. For a
constant heating rate of 0.015 erg g^{-1} s^{-1}, the mean pressure is around
24 x 10^{-14} dyn (corresponding to p/k_B ~ K cm^{-3}). Cool patches tend to
coalesce into bigger ones. In all cases investigated there is no sustained
turbulence, which is in agreement with earlier results. Simulations in which
turbulence is driven by a body force show that when rms velocities of between
10 and 30 km/s are obtained, the resulting dissipation rates rates are
comparable to the thermal energy input rate. The resulting mean pressures are
then about 30 x 10^{-14} dyn, corresponding to p/k_B ~ 2170 K cm^{-3}. This is
comparable to the value expected for the Galaxy. Differential rotation tends to
make the flow two-dimensional, that is, uniform in the streamwise direction,
but this does not lead to instability.",2006-04-11T19:22:45Z
"Warm Molecular Gas in the Outflow and Envelope of IRAS 12496-7650 (DK
  Cha)","Aims:To obtain insight into the physical structure of the warm gas in the
inner envelope of protostars and the interaction with the outflow. Methods:
Sub-millimeter observations of 12CO, 13CO and/or C18O in J=3-2, J=4-3 and J=7-6
were obtained with the APEX Telescope towards IRAS 12496-7650, an intermediate
mass young stellar object. The data are compared to ISO-LWS observations of CO
J=14-13 up to J=19-18 lines to test the different proposed origins of the CO
lines. Results: The outflow is prominently detected in the 3-2 and 4-3 lines,
but not seen at similar velocities in the 7-6 line, constraining the
temperature in the high-velocity (> 5 km/s from line center) gas to less than
50 K, much lower than inferred from the analysis of the ISO-LWS data. In
addition, no isothermal gas model can reproduce the emission in both the 7-6
and the higher-J ISO-LWS lines.The 7-6 line probably originates in the inner
(<250 AU) region of the envelope at ~150 K. Detailed radiative transfer
calculations suggest that the ISO-LWS lines are excited by a different
mechanism, possibly related to the larger-scale outflow. All possible
mechanisms on scales smaller than 8 "" are excluded. High-resolution continuum
as well as high-J 12CO and isotopic line mapping are needed to better constrain
the structure of the warm gas in the inner envelope and the interaction with
the outflow.",2006-05-19T19:18:00Z
EXO 0748-676 Rules out Soft Equations of State for Neutron Star Matter,"The interiors of neutron stars contain matter at very high densities, in a
state that differs greatly from those found in the early universe or achieved
at terrestrial experiments. Matter in these conditions can only be probed
through astrophysical observations that measure the mass and radius of neutron
stars with sufficient precision. Here I report for the first time a unique
determination of the mass and radius of the neutron star EXO 0748-676, which
appears to rule out all the soft equations of state of neutron star matter. If
this object is typical, then condensates and unconfined quarks do not exist in
the centers of neutron stars.",2006-05-03T20:01:28Z
"VLT K-band spectroscopy of massive young stellar objects in
  (ultra-)compact HII regions","High-quality K-band spectra of strongly reddened point sources, deeply
embedded in (ultra-) compact HII regions, have revealed a population of 20
young massive stars showing no photospheric absorption lines, but sometimes
strong Br-gamma emission. The Br-gamma equivalent widths occupy a wide range
(from about 1 to over 100 A); the line widths of 100-200 km/s indicate a
circumstellar rather than a nebular origin. The K-band spectra exhibit one or
more features commonly associated with massive young stellar objects (YSOs)
surrounded by circumstellar material: a very red colour (J-K) > 2, CO bandhead
emission, hydrogen emission lines (sometimes doubly peaked), and FeII and/or
MgII emission lines. The massive YSO distribution in the CMD suggests that the
majority of the objects are of similar spectral type as the Herbig Be stars,
but some of them are young O stars.
  The CO emission must come from a relatively dense (~10^{10} cm^{-3}) and hot
(T~ 2000-5000 K) region, sufficiently shielded from the intense UV radiation
field of the young massive star. The hydrogen emission is produced in an
ionised medium exposed to UV radiation. The best geometrical solution is a
dense and neutral circumstellar disk causing the CO bandhead emission, and an
ionised upper layer where the hydrogen lines are produced. We present arguments
that the circumstellar disk is more likely a remnant of the accretion process
than the result of rapid rotation and mass loss such as in Be/B[e] stars.",2006-05-17T13:00:09Z
The velocity dispersion and mass profile of the Milky Way,"We re-analyse the velocity-dispersion profile sigma(r) at radii r>10 kpc in
the Galactic stellar halo, recently derived by Battaglia et al. (2005), who
concluded that, for constant velocity anisotropy of the tracers, these data
rule out a flat circular-speed curve for the Milky Way. However, we demonstrate
that if one makes the natural assumption that the tracer density is truncated
at r_t >~ 160 kpc and falls off significantly more steeply than r^-3.5 at r >~
80 kpc, then these data are consistent with a flat circular-speed curve and a
constant velocity anisotropy comparable to that observed for halo stars in the
Solar neighbourhood. We also consider a more detailed mass model with an
exponential stellar disc and an extended non-isothermal dark-matter halo. In
this two-component model, the Milky Way's virial radius and mass are r_vir =
200 kpc and M_vir = 1.5 x 10^12 M_sun. Still assuming the tracers' velocity
anisotropy to be constant (at beta=0.5) we again find good agreement with the
observed sigma(r), so long as the tracer density is truncated near the virial
radius. These data by themselves do not allow to differentiate between
different dark-halo or total-mass models for the Milky Way, nor between
different velocity-anisotropy profiles for the tracers.",2006-03-30T16:42:34Z
The Stellar Imager (SI) Vision Mission,"The Stellar Imager (SI) is a UV-Optical, Space-Based Interferometer designed
to enable 0.1 milli-arcsecond (mas) spectral imaging of stellar surfaces and of

System Connection (SSSC) Roadmap and as a candidate for a ""Pathways to Life
Observatory"" in the Exploration of the Universe Division (EUD) Roadmap (May,
2005). SI will revolutionize our view of many dynamic astrophysical processes:
its resolution will transform point sources into extended sources, and
snapshots into evolving views. SI's science focuses on the role of magnetism in
the Universe, particularly on magnetic activity on the surfaces of stars like
the Sun. SI's prime goal is to enable long-term forecasting of solar activity
and the space weather that it drives. SI will also revolutionize our
understanding of the formation of planetary systems, of the habitability and
climatology of distant planets, and of many magneto-hydrodynamically controlled

Tracing Quasar Accretion Rates at Higher Redshifts,"In this work we connect some measurable properties of the CIV1549 emission
line with the quasar accretion rates (Eddington ratios). A tight correlation is
found for a sample of more than a hundred nearby objects, suggesting a possible
method for a relatively accurate estimate of the Eddington ratio of
high-redshift quasars, at least for the radio-quiet ones. This paper further
confirms the existing notion that the CIV changes (shifts) are mostly driven by
the accretion rate.",2006-06-26T09:52:55Z
"The DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey: Clustering of Quasars and Galaxies at
  z=1","We present the clustering of DEEP2 galaxies at 0.7<z<1.4 around quasars
identified using both the SDSS and DEEP2 surveys. We measure the two-point
cross-correlation of a sample of 36 optically-selected,
spectroscopically-identified quasars from the SDSS and 16 more found in the
DEEP2 survey with the full DEEP2 galaxy sample over scales 0.1 < r_p < 10
Mpc/h. The clustering amplitude is found to be similar to the auto-correlation
function of DEEP2 galaxies, with a relative bias of b=0.89 +/-0.24 between
quasars and DEEP2 galaxies at z~1. No significant dependence is found on scale,
quasar luminosity, or redshift over the ranges we probe here. The clustering
amplitude errors are comparable to those from significantly larger quasar
samples, such as the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey. This results from the statistical
power of cross-correlation techniques, which exploit the fact that galaxies are
much more numerous than quasars. We also measure the local environments of
quasars using the 3rd-nearest-neighbor surface density of surrounding DEEP2
galaxies. Quasars are found in regions of similar mean overdensity as blue
DEEP2 galaxies; they differ in environment from the red DEEP2 galaxy population
at 2 sigma significance. Our results imply that quasars do not reside in
particularly massive dark matter halos at these redshifts, with a mean dark
matter halo mass of M_200 ~ 3 10^12 solar masses in a concordance LCDM

"Formation and evolution of early-type galaxies. II. Models with
  quasi-cosmological initial conditions","In this study, with the aid of N-Body simulations based on quasi-cosmological
initial conditions, we have followed the formation and evolution of two models
of early-type galaxies, from their separation from global expansion of the
Universe to their collapse to virialized structures, the formation of stars and
subsequent nearly passive evolution. The cosmological background we have
considered is the Standard CDM. The models have significantly different nitial
total mass. Particular care has been paid to the star formation process,
heating and cooling of gas, and chemical enrichment. In both models star
formation is completed within the first Gyrs of evolution. The structural
properties of the present-day models are in good agreement with current
observations. The chemical properties, mean metallicity and metallicity
gradients also agree with available observational data. Finally, conspicuous
galactic winds are found to occur. The models conform to the so-called revised
monolithic scheme, because mergers of substructures have occurred very early in
the galaxy life. Our results agree with those obtained in other similar recent
studies, thus strengthening the idea that the revised monolithic scheme is the
right trail to follow in the forest of galaxy formation and evolution.",2006-05-02T09:42:07Z
The NIR Upgrade to the SALT Robert Stobie Spectrograph,"The near infrared (NIR) upgrade to the Robert Stobie Spectrograph (RSS) on

Fabry-Perot imaging capabilities. The visible and NIR arms can be used
simultaneously to extend spectral coverage from approximately 3200 A to 1.6 um.
Both arms utilize high efficiency volume phase holographic gratings via
articulating gratings and cameras. The NIR camera is designed around a

design of the camera consists of 6 spherical elements, providing sub-pixel rms
image sizes of 7.5 +/- 1.0 um over all wavelengths and field angles. The exact
long wavelength cutoff is yet to be determined in a detailed thermal analysis

nights during four observing seasons (2000 - 2003). A total number of 6418
lightcurves of bright objects in the range of 14 - 21 mag have been obtained.
All measurements are publicly available. A total of 127 new variables were
detected, of which 28 are periodic. Ten previously known non-periodic variables
were identified as periodic, 3 of which are Cepheids, and another previously
known periodic variable was identified as an eclipsing binary. Our derived
periods range from 2.11 to almost 300 days. For 50 variables we have combined
our observations with those of the DIRECT project, obtaining lightcurves of up
to 500 measurements, with a time-span of ~7 years. We have detected a few
interesting variables, including a 99.3 day periodic variable with a 0.04 mag
amplitude, at the position of SNR 19.",2006-05-15T08:57:10Z
Cosmography with cluster strong lensing,"By stacking an ensemble of strong lensing clusters, we demonstrate the
feasibility of placing constraints on the dark energy equation of state. This
is achieved by using multiple images of sources at two or more distinct
redshift planes. The sample of smooth clusters in our simulations is based on
observations of massive clusters and the distribution of background galaxies is
constructed using the Hubble Deep Field. Our source distribution reproduces the
observed redshift distribution of multiply imaged sources in Abell 1689. The
cosmology recovery depends on the number of image families with known
spectroscopic redshifts and the number of stacked clusters. Our simulations
suggest that constraints comparable to those derived from other competing
established techniques on a constant dark energy equation of state can be
obtained using 10 to 40 clusters with 5 or more families of multiple images. We
have also studied the observational errors in the image redshifts and
positions. We find that spectroscopic redshifts and high resolution {\it Hubble
Space Telescope} images are required to eliminate confidence contour relaxation
relative to the ideal case in our simulations. This suggests that the dark
energy equation of state, and other cosmological parameters, can be constrained
with existing {\it Hubble Space Telescope} images of lensing clusters coupled
with dedicated ground-based arc spectroscopy.",2006-05-10T15:24:52Z
Rapid Formation of Super-Earths around M Dwarf Stars,"While the recent microlensing discoveries of super-Earths orbiting two M
dwarf stars have been taken as support for the core accretion mechanism of
giant planet formation, we show here that these planets could also have been
formed by the competing mechanism of disk instability, coupled with
photoevaporative loss of their gaseous envelopes by a strong external source of
UV radiation, i.e., an O star. M dwarfs that form in regions of future
high-mass star formation would then be expected to have super-Earths orbiting
at distances of several AU and beyond, while those that form in regions of
low-mass star formation would be expected to have gas giants at those
distances. Given that most stars are born in the former rather than in the
latter regions, M dwarfs should have significantly more super-Earths than gas
giants, as seems to be indicated by the microlensing surveys.",2006-05-02T17:37:07Z
Galaxy number counts in a presence of the graviton background,"In the model of low-energy quantum gravity by the author, cosmological
redshifts are caused by interactions of photons with gravitons. Non-forehead
collisions with gravitons will lead to an additional relaxation of any photonic
flux. Using only the luminosity distance and a geometrical one as functions of
a redshift in this model, theoretical predictions for galaxy number counts are
considered here. The Schechter luminosity function with $\alpha =-2.43$ is
used. The considered model provides a good fit to galaxy observations by Yasuda
et al. (AJ, 122 (2001) 1104) if the same K-corrections are added. It is shown
that observations of $N(z)$ for different magnitudes $m$ are a lot more
informative than the ones of $N(m).$",2006-06-09T15:13:55Z
"Black Hole-Neutron Star Binary Merger Calculations: GRB Progenitors and
  the Stability of Mass Transfer","We have calculated the first dynamical evolutions of merging black
hole-neutron star binaries that treat the combined spacetime in a
nonperturbative general relativistic framework. Using the conformal flatness
approximation, we have studied how the location of the tidal disruption radius
with respect to the the black hole horizon and innermost stable circular orbit
(ISCO) affects the qualitative evolution of the system. Based on simple
arguments, we show that for a binary mass ratio q>~0.24, tidal disruption
occurs outside the ISCO, while the opposite is true for q<~0.24. When tidal
disruption occurs sufficiently far outside the ISCO, mass is transferred
unstably from the neutron star to the black hole, resulting in the complete
disruption of the neutron star. When tidal disruption occurs slightly within
the ISCO, we find that some of the mass forms an extremely hot disk around the
black hole. The resulting configurations in this case are excellent candidates
for the progenitors of short-hard gamma ray bursts.",2006-05-19T20:00:15Z
The large-scale structure of the Universe,"Research over the past 25 years has led to the view that the rich tapestry of
present-day cosmic structure arose during the first instants of creation, where
weak ripples were imposed on the otherwise uniform and rapidly expanding
primordial soup. Over 14 billion years of evolution, these ripples have been
amplified to enormous proportions by gravitational forces, producing
ever-growing concentrations of dark matter in which ordinary gases cool,
condense and fragment to make galaxies. This process can be faithfully mimicked
in large computer simulations, and tested by a variety of observations that
probe the history of the Universe starting from just 400,000 yr after the Big
Bang.",2006-04-27T17:59:54Z
"Effects of a Local Interstellar Magnetic Field on Voyager 1 and 2
  Observations","We show that that an interstellar magnetic field can produce a north/south
asymmetry in solar wind termination shock. Using Voyager 1 and 2 measurements,
we suggest that the angle $\alpha$ between the interstellar wind velocity and
magnetic field is $30^{\circ} < \alpha < 60^{\circ}$. The distortion of the
shock is such that termination shock particles could stream outward along the
spiral interplanetary magnetic field connecting Voyager 1 to the shock when the
spacecraft was within $\sim 2~AU$ of the shock. The shock distortion is larger
in the southern hemisphere, and Voyager 2 could be connected to the shock when
it is within $\sim 5~AU$ of the shock, but with particles from the shock
streaming inward along the field. Tighter constraints on the interstellar
magnetic field should be possible when Voyager 2 crosses the shock in the next
several years.",2006-03-13T19:30:59Z
"On the Perils of Curve-of-Growth Analysis: Systematic Abundance
  Underestimates for the Gas in Gamma-Ray Burst Host Galaxies","We examine the practice of deriving interstellar medium (ISM) abundances from
low-resolution spectroscopy of GRB afterglows. We argue that the multi-ion
single-component curve-of-growth analysis technique systematically
underestimates the column densities of the metal-line profiles commonly
observed for GRB. This systematic underestimate is accentuated by the fact that
many GRB line-profiles (e.g. GRB 050730, GRB 050820, GRB 051111) are comprised
of `clouds' with a bi-modal distribution of column density. Such line-profiles
may be characteristic of a sightline which penetrates both a high density
star-forming region and more distant, ambient ISM material. Our analysis
suggests that the majority of abundances reported in the literature are
systematically underestimates and that the reported errors are frequently
over-optimistic. Further, we demonstrate that one cannot even report precise
relative abundances with confidence. The implications are profound for our
current understanding on the metallicity, dust-to-gas ratio, and chemical
abundances of the ISM in GRB host galaxies. For example, we argue that all but
a few sightlines allow for the gas to have at least solar metallicity. Finally,
we suggests new approaches for constraining the abundances.",2006-06-20T21:35:58Z
"Magnetic Field Decay and Period Evolution of Anomalous X-Ray Pulsars in
  the Context of Quark Stars","We discuss a model wherein soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs), anomalous X-ray
pulsars (AXPs), and radio quiet isolated neutron stars (RQINSs) are all compact
objects exhibiting superconductivity, namely color-flavor locked quark stars.
In particular we calculate the magnetic field decay due to the expulsion of
spin-induced vortices from the star's superfluid-superconducting interior, and
the resultant spin-down rate. We find that, for initial parameters
characteristic of AXPs/SGRs ($10^{13}<B<10^{14}~\rm{G}$; $3<P<12~\rm{s}$), the
magnetic field strengths and periods remain unchanged within a factor of two
for timescales of the order of $5\times 10^{5} - 5\times 10^{7}~\rm{yrs}$ given
a quark star of radius $10~\rm{km}$. Within these timescales, we show that the
observed period clustering in RQINSs can be explained by compactness, as well
as calculate how the magnetic field and period evolve in a manner concurrent
with RQINS observations.",2006-03-27T22:46:59Z
"Telescope to Observe Planetary Systems (TOPS): a high throughput 1.2-m
  visible telescope with a small inner working angle","The Telescope to Observe Planetary Systems (TOPS) is a proposed space mission
to image in the visible (0.4-0.9 micron) planetary systems of nearby stars
simultaneously in 16 spectral bands (resolution R~20). For the ~10 most
favorable stars, it will have the sensitivity to discover 2 R_E rocky planets
within habitable zones and characterize their surfaces or atmospheres through
spectrophotometry. Many more massive planets and debris discs will be imaged
and characterized for the first time. With a 1.2m visible telescope, the
proposed mission achieves its power by exploiting the most efficient and robust
coronagraphic and wavefront control techniques. The Phase-Induced Amplitude
Apodization (PIAA) coronagraph used by TOPS allows planet detection at 2
lambda/d with nearly 100% throughput and preserves the telescope angular
resolution. An efficient focal plane wavefront sensing scheme accurately
measures wavefront aberrations which are fed back to the telescope active
primary mirror. Fine wavefront control is also performed independently in each
of 4 spectral channels, resulting in a system that is robust to wavefront
chromaticity.",2006-06-16T03:18:02Z
Synthetic Super AGB Stars,"We describe our first attempt at modelling nucleosynthesis in massive AGB
stars which have undergone core carbon burning, the super-AGB stars. We fit a
synthetic model to detailed stellar evolution models in the mass range
9<=M/Msun<=11.5 (Z=0.02), and extrapolate these fits to the end of the AGB. We
determine the number of thermal pulses and AGB lifetime as a function of mass
and mass-loss prescription. Our preliminary nucleosynthesis calculations show
that, for a reasonable mass-loss rate, the effect of hot-bottom burning in
super-AGB stars on the integrated yield of a stellar population is not large.
There are many uncertainties, such as mass-loss and convective overshooting,
which prevent accurate yield calculations. However, as potential progenitors of
electron-capture supernovae, these stars may contribute 7% of non-type-Ia
supernovae.",2006-03-28T10:38:17Z
"The Star Formation Histories of the Bulge and Disk of M31 from Gemini
  North+NIRI/Altair and HST/NICMOS","We discuss H and K observations of three fields in the bulge and disk of M31
obtained with the Altair adaptive optics system and NIRI instrument on Gemini
North. These are the highest resolution and deepest near-infrared observations
obtained to date of the inner regions of M31, and demonstrate the promise of
ground-based adaptive optics for studying the crowded regions of nearby
galaxies. We have combined our observations with previously published
HST/NICMOS observations of nine M31 fields and have derived the coarse star
formation histories of M31's bulge and inner disk. From fits to the M_K
luminosity functions, we find the stellar population mix to be dominated by
old, nearly solar-metallicity stars. The old populations, which we define as
having age >~6 Gyr, indeed dominate the star formation histories at all radii
independent of the relative contributions of bulge and disk stars. Although all
of our fields contain some bulge contribution, our results suggest that there
is no age difference between the bulge and disk to the limit of our precision.",2006-03-29T15:38:48Z
Cosmic tomographies: baryon acoustic oscillations and weak lensing,"We explore the complementarity between two tomographic probes of the
universe: baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) and weak lensing (WL). We find
that photometric measurements of BAOs alone do not provide very tight
constraints on the dark energy equation of state parameters, partially due to
our uncertain knowledge of the galaxy bias. WL, on the other hand, is adversely
impacted by the uncertainties of the probability distribution of photometric
redshift (photo-z) errors. A joint analysis of the two, however, is more robust
to these uncertainties and leads to a remarkable improvement over the results
of either probe alone.
  Forecasts of cosmological constraints are provided for various BAO and WL
surveys in combination with CMB measurements from Planck. In particular, we
find that the joint analysis of BAO and WL power spectra with the Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope can tighten the errors of the dark energy equation of
state (at a = 0.63) and its rate of change, respectively, to 0.016 and 0.16
(marginalized over 131 other parameters). With supernovae and cluster counting
as well as higher-order statistics of the same galaxy and shear data, one can
further improve the constraints.",2006-05-29T08:50:45Z
The alignment of dark matter halos with the cosmic web,"We investigate the orientation of the axes and angular momentum of dark
matter halos with respect to their neighboring voids using high resolution
N-body cosmological simulations. We find that the minor axis of halos tends to
be aligned along the line joining the halo with the center of the void, and
that the major axis is perpendicular to this line. However, we find that the
angular momentum of halos does not have any particular orientation. These
results may provide information about the mechanisms whereby the large-scale
structure of the Universe affects galaxy formation and cast light upon the
issue of the orientation of galaxy disks with respect to their host halos.",2006-06-18T22:49:10Z
"Detection regimes of the cosmological gravitational wave background from
  astrophysical sources","Key targets for gravitational wave (GW) observatories, such as LIGO and the
next generation interferometric detector, Advanced LIGO, include core-collapse
of massive stars and the final stage of coalescence of compact stellar
remnants. The combined GW signal from such events occurring throughout the
Universe will produce an astrophysical GW background (AGB), one that is
fundamentally different from the GW background by very early Universe
processes. One can classify contributions to the AGB for different classes of
sources based on the strength of the GW emissions from the individual sources,
their peak emission frequency, emission duration and their event rate density
distribution. This article provides an overview of the detectability regimes of
the AGB in the context of current and planned gravitational wave observatories.
We show that there are two important AGB signal detection regimes, which we
define as `continuous' and `popcorn noise'. We describe how the `popcorn noise'
AGB regime evolves with observation time and we discuss how this feature
distinguishes it from the GW background produced from very early Universe
processes.",2006-07-04T08:36:40Z
Understanding the Cosmic Mass Function High Mass Behaviour,"We claim that the discrepancy found between theoretical predictions for the
cosmic mass function and those found in numerical simulations is due to the
fact that in deriving the former all mass elements are assumed to be at the
center of the object they belong to (the all-mass-at-center problem). By an
appropriate treatment of this problem, using the spherical collapse model
(which is not a bad approximation in the high mass limit), we obtain both the
high mass behaviour found in simulations and the true assymptotic behaviour of
the mass function (for arbitrarily high masses). Therefore, we conclude that by
combining ellipsoidal dynamics with a suitable treatment of the
all-mass-at-center problem (that we will show in a follow up work) a
theoretical prediction for the cosmic mass function in full agreement with
simulations may be obtained.",2006-05-24T00:21:44Z
What is special about HBRPs,"The Parkes Multibeam Survey led to the identification ofa number of
long-period radio pulsars with magnetic field well above the quantum critical
field of 4.4 times 10 to 13 G (defined as high magnetic field radio pulsars -
HBRPs). Traditional pulsar emission theories postulate that radio emission is
suppressed above this critical field. The aim of thisproject is to understand
emission properties of HBRPs.",2006-04-18T03:13:13Z
"Tomography of the Reionization Epoch with Multifrequency CMB
  Observations","We study the constraints that future multifrequency Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) experiments will be able to set on the metal enrichment
history of the Inter Galactic Medium at the epoch of reionisation. We forecast
the signal to noise ratio for the detection of the signal introduced in the CMB
by resonant scattering off metals at the end of the Dark Ages. We take into
account systematics associated to inter-channel calibration, PSF reconstruction
errors and innacurate foreground removal. We develop an algorithm to optimally
extract the signal generated by metals during reionisation and to remove
accurately the contamination due to the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.
Although demanding levels of foreground characterisation and control of
systematics are required, they are very distinct from those encountered in
HI-21cm studies and CMB polarization, and this fact encourages the study of
resonant scattering off metals as an alternative way of conducting tomography
of the reionisation epoch. An ACT-like experiment with optimistic assumtions on
systematic effects, and looking at clean regions of the sky, can detect changes
of 3%-12% (95% c.l.) of the OIII abundance (with respect its solar value) in
the redshift range $z\in$ [12,22], for reionization redshift $z_{\rm re}>10$.
However, for $z_{\rm re} <10$, it can only set upper limits on NII abundance
increments of $\sim$ 60% its solar value in the redshift range $z\in$ [5.5,9],
(95% c.l.). These constraints assume that inter-channel calibration is accurate
down to one part in $10^{4}$, which constitutes the most critical technical
requirement of this method, but still achievable with current technology.",2006-04-14T05:07:51Z
Gallery of Planetary Nebula Spectra,"We present the Gallery of Planetary Nebula Spectra now available at
http://oit.williams.edu/nebulae The website offers high-quality, moderate
resolution (~7-10 A FWHM) spectra of 128 Galactic planetary nebulae from
3600-9600 A, obtained by Kwitter, Henry, and colleagues with the Goldcam
spectrograph at the KPNO 2.1-m or with the RC spectrograph at the CTIO 1.5-m.
The master PN table contains atlas data and an image link. A selected object's
spectrum is displayed in a zoomable window; line identification templates are
provided. In addition to the spectra themselves, the website also contains a
brief discussion of PNe as astronomical objects and as contributors to our
understanding of stellar evolution. We envision that this website, which
concentrates a large amount of data in one place, will be of interest to a
variety of users: researchers might need to check the spectrum of a particular
object of interest; the non-specialist astronomer might simply be interested in
perusing such a collection of spectra; and finally, teachers of introductory
astronomy can use this database to illustrate basic principles of atomic
physics and radiation. To particularly encourage this last use, we have
developed two paper-and-pencil exercises to introduce beginning astronomy
students to the wealth of information that PN spectra contain.",2006-05-01T20:12:08Z
E+A Galaxies with Blue Cores: Active Galaxies in Transition,"HST ACS images reveal blue cores in four E+A, or post-starburst, galaxies.
Follow-up spectroscopy shows that these cores have LINER spectra. The existence
of LINERs, consistent with those in many elliptical galaxies, is yet one more
piece of evidence that these post-merger, post-starburst, bulge-dominated
galaxies will evolve into normal ellipticals. More interestingly, if LINERs are
powered by low-luminosity AGN, their presence in these E+As suggests that any
rapid growth phase of the central black hole ended in rough concert with the
cessation of star formation. This result emphasizes the importance of E+As for
exploring how the evolution of black holes and AGN may be tied to that of
galactic bulges.",2006-06-15T00:19:40Z
2.3 micron CO emission and absorption from young high-mass stars in M17,"We are studying the extremely young cluster of M17 to investigate the birth
of high-mass stars and the initial mass function. Deep JHKL imaging and K-band
spectroscopy from the VLT of 201 stars toward the cluster is presented. The
majority of 104 stars show the CO band-head in absorption. Half of them emit
X-rays and/or have infrared excess, indicative of very young objects. Their
intrinsic IR luminosity is compatible with intermediate and high-mass pre-main
sequence stars. Nine additional stars have the CO feature in emission, while
sixty sources are lacking any stellar spectral feature due to veiling by
circumstellar dust. We suggest that CO absorption is - as in the case of
low-mass stars - also a common feature during the early evolution of stars with
higher masses. According to model calculations the observed CO absorption is
most likely a sign of heavily accreting protostars with mass accretion rates
above 10^-5 solar masses/yr.",2006-08-03T12:07:39Z
"About universes with scale-related total masses and their abolition of
  presently outstanding cosmological problems","Cosmological consequences of a strictly valid total energy conservation for
the whole universe are investigated in this paper. Interestingly enough as one
consequence of ergodically behaving universes very specific scaling laws with
the diameter R of the universe can be derived for relevant cosmic quantities.
Especially the 1/R^2- scaling of mass - and vacuum energy - density then
automatically leads to a vanishing cosmic curvature parameter k=0 and also
reveals, that for such universes no horizon problem occurs. In addition the
longstanding problem of observationally indicated very low cosmic vacuum
energies in contrast to the very large quantumfield estimates is easily solved
when the vacuum energy density decay with 1/R^2 is taken into account
reconciling presently observed vacuum energy density values with those from
theoretical expectations. We also suggest why the mass of the universe can
permanently increase and can in fact grow up from a Planck mass as a pure
vacuum fluctuation.",2006-06-02T11:55:44Z
Hickson 62.I. Kinematics of NGC4778,"Detailed studies of the photometric and kinematical properties of compact
groups of galaxies are crucial to understand the physics of galaxy interactions
and to shed light on some aspects of galaxy formation and evolution. In this
paper we present a kinematical and photometrical study of a member, NGC4778, of
the nearest (z=0.0137) compact group: Hickson 62.
  Aims: The aim of this work was to investigate the existence of kinematical
anomalies in the brightest group member, NGC4778 in order to constrain the
dynamical status and the formation history of the group.
  Methods: We used long-slit spectra obtained with FORS1 at VLT, to measure
line-of-sight velocity distributions by means of the Fourier Correlation
Quotient method, and to derive the galaxy rotation curve and velocity
dispersion profile.
  Results: Our analysis reveals that Hickson 62a, also known as NGC4778, is an
S0 galaxy with kinematical and morphological peculiarities, both in its central
regions (r < 5'') and in the outer halo. In the central regions, the rotation
curve shows the existence of a kinematically decoupled stellar component,
offset with respect to the photometric center. In the outer halo we find an
asymmetric rotation curve and a velocity dispersion profile showing a rise on
the SW side, in direction of the galaxy NGC4776.
  Conclusions: The nuclear counterrotation, the distorted kinematics in the
outer halo and the X-ray properties of the group suggest that NGC4778 may be
the product of a recent minor merger, more reliable with a small late-type
galaxy.",2006-06-29T17:08:23Z
AMANDA Observations Constrain the Ultra-High Energy Neutrino Flux,"A number of experimental techniques are currently being deployed in an effort
to make the first detection of ultra-high energy cosmic neutrinos. To
accomplish this goal, techniques using radio and acoustic detectors are being
developed, which are optimally designed for studying neutrinos with energies in
the PeV-EeV range and above. Data from the AMANDA experiment, in contrast, has
been used to place limits on the cosmic neutrino flux at less extreme energies
(up to ~10 PeV). In this letter, we show that by adopting a different analysis
strategy, optimized for much higher energy neutrinos, the same AMANDA data can
be used to place a limit competitive with radio techniques at EeV energies. We
also discuss the sensitivity of the IceCube experiment, in various stages of
deployment, to ultra-high energy neutrinos.",2006-05-03T19:31:17Z
"Exploring Halo Substructure with Giant Stars XI: The Tidal Tails of the
  Carina Dwarf Spheroidal and the Discovery of Magellanic Cloud Stars in the
  Carina Foreground","A new large-area Washington M,T_2+DDO51 filter survey of more than 10 deg^2
around the Carina dSph galaxy reveals a spectroscopically confirmed power law
radial density ""break"" population of Carina giant stars extending several
degrees beyond the central King profile. Magellan telescope MIKE spectroscopy
establishes the existence of Carina stars to at least 4.5 times its central
King limiting radius, r_lim and primarily along Carina's major axis. To keep
these stars bound to the dSph would require a global Carina mass-to-light ratio
of M/L > 6,300 M/L_sun. The MIKE velocities, supplemented with ~950 additional
Carina field velocities from archived VLT+GIRAFFE spectra with r<=r_lim,
demonstrate a nearly constant Carina velocity dispersion to just beyond r =
r_lim, and both a rising velocity dispersion and a velocity shear at still
larger radii. Together, the observational evidence suggests that the discovered
extended Carina population represents tidal debris from the dSph. Of 65 giant
candidates at large angular radii from the Carina center for which MIKE spectra
have been obtained 94% are associated either with Carina or a second, newly
discovered diffuse, but strongly radial velocity-coherent (velocity dispersion
of 9.8 km s^-1), foreground halo system. The fifteen stars in this second,
retrograde velocity population have (1) a mean metallicity ~1 dex higher than
that of Carina, and (2) colors and magnitudes consistent with the red clump of
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Additional spectroscopy of giant star
candidates in fields linking Carina and the LMC shows a smooth velocity
gradient between the LMC and the retrograde Carina moving group. We conclude
that we have found Magellanic stars almost twice as far (22 deg) from the LMC
center than previously known.",2006-05-03T16:56:07Z
Optimized supernova constraints on dark energy evolution,"A model-independent method to study the possible evolution of dark energy is
presented. Optimal estimates of the dark energy equation of state w are
obtained from current supernovae data from Riess et al. (2004) following a
principal components approach. We assess the impact of varying the number of
piecewise constant estimates of w using a model selection method, the Bayesian
information criterion, and compare the most favored models with some
parametrizations commonly used in the literature. Although data seem to prefer
a cosmological constant, some models are only moderately disfavored by our
selection criterion: a constant w, w linear in the scale factor, w linear in
redshift and the two-parameter models introduced here. Among these, the models
we find by optimization are slightly preferred. However, current data do not
allow us to draw a conclusion on the possible evolution of dark energy.
Interestingly, the best fits for all varying-w models exhibit a w<-1 at low
redshifts.",2006-05-16T22:33:46Z
Extrasolar Transiting Planet Search with Subaru Suprime-Cam,"We report the results of a prototype photometric search for transiting
extrasolar planets using Subaru Suprime-Cam. Out of about 100,000 stars
monitored around the Galactic plane (l=90 degree,b=0 degree), we find that
7,700 (27,000) stars show the photometric precision below 1% (3%) for 60 second
exposures which is required to detect extrasolar planets by the transit method.
Thus Suprime-Cam has the photometric stability and accuracy required for a
transiting planet survey. During this observing run, we detected three
transiting planetary candidates (i'-band magnitude around 18.5) which exhibit a
single full transit-like light curve with a fractional depth of <5%. While
future photometric and/or spectroscopic follow-ups remain to be done, the
estimated parameters for the three systems are consistent with planetary
companions around main-sequence stars. We also found two eclipsing binary
candidates and eleven variable stars exhibiting W UMa-like light curves.",2006-03-14T13:26:12Z
Population analysis of open clusters: radii and mass segregation,"Aims: Based on our well-determined sample of open clusters in the all-sky
catalogue ASCC-2.5 we derive new linear sizes of some 600 clusters, and
investigate the effect of mass segregation of stars in open clusters. Methods:
Using statistical methods, we study the distribution of linear sizes as a
function of spatial position and cluster age. We also examine statistically the
distribution of stars of different masses within clusters as a function of the
cluster age. Results: No significant dependence of the cluster size on location
in the Galaxy is detected for younger clusters (< 200 Myr), whereas older
clusters inside the solar orbit turned out to be, on average, smaller than
outside. Also, small old clusters are preferentially found close to the
Galactic plane, whereas larger ones more frequently live farther away from the
plane and at larger Galactocentric distances. For clusters with (V - M_V) <
10.5, a clear dependence of the apparent radius on age has been detected: the
cluster radii decrease by a factor of about 2 from an age of 10 Myr to an age
of 1 Gyr. A detailed analysis shows that this observed effect can be explained
by mass segregation and does not necessarily reflect a real decrease of cluster
radii. We found evidence for the latter for the majority of clusters older than
30 Myr. Among the youngest clusters (between 5 and 30 Myr), there are some
clusters with a significant grade of mass segregation, whereas some others show
no segregation at all. At a cluster age between 50 and 100 Myrs, the
distribution of stars of different masses becomes more regular over cluster
area. In older clusters the evolution of the massive stars is the most
prominent effect we observe.",2006-06-09T10:30:55Z
"Modelling the closest double degenerate system RXJ0806.3+1527 and its
  decreasing period","In the hypothesis that the 5.4m binary RXJ0806.3+1527 consists of a low mass
helium white dwarf (donor) transferring mass towards its more massive white
dwarf companion (primary), we consider as possible donors white dwarfs which
are the result of common envelope evolution occurring when the helium core mass
of the progenitor giant was still very small (~ 0.2Msun), so that they are
surrounded by a quite massive hydrogen envelope (~1/100Msun or larger), and
live for a very long time supported by proton--proton burning. Mass transfer
from such low mass white dwarfs very probably starts during the hydrogen
burning stage, and the donor structure will remain dominated by the burning
shell until it loses all the hydrogen envelope and begins transferring helium.
We model mass transfer from these low mass white dwarfs, and show that the
radius of the donor decreases while they shed the hydrogen envelope. This
radius behavior, which is due to the fact that the white dwarf is not fully
degenerate, has two important consequences on the evolution of the binary: 1)
the orbital period decreases, with a timescale consistent with the period
decrease of the binary RXJ0806.3+1527; 2) the mass transfer rate is a factor of
about 10 smaller than from a fully degenerate white dwarf, easing the problem
connected with the small X-ray luminosity of this object. The possibility that
such evolution describes the system RXJ0806.3+1527 is also consistent with the
possible presence of hydrogen in the optical spectrum of the star, whose
confirmation would become a test of the model.",2006-06-23T06:18:04Z
Characterization of jovian plasma embedded dust particles,"As the data from space missions and laboratories improve, a research domain
combining plasmas and charged dust is gaining in prominence. Our solar system
provides many natural laboratories such as planetary rings, comet comae and
tails, ejecta clouds around moons and asteroids, and Earth's noctilucent clouds
for which to closely study plasma-embedded cosmic dust. One natural laboratory
to study electromagnetically-controlled cosmic dust has been provided by the
Jovian dust streams and the data from the instruments which were on board the
Galileo spacecraft. Given the prodigious quantity of dust poured into the
Jovian magnetosphere by Io and its volcanoes resulting in the dust streams, the
possibility of dusty plasma conditions exist. This paper characterizes the main
parameters for those interested in studying dust embedded in a plasma with a
focus on the Jupiter environment. I show how to distinguish between
dust-in-plasma and dusty-plasma and how the Havnes parameter P can be used to
support or negate the possibility of collective behavior of the dusty plasma.
The result of applying these tools to the Jovian dust streams reveals mostly
dust-in-plasma behavior. In the orbits displaying the highest dust stream
fluxes, portions of orbits E4, G7, G8, C21 satisfy the minimum requirements for
a dusty plasma. However, the P parameter demonstrates that these mild dusty
plasma conditions do not lead to collective behavior of the dust stream
particles.",2006-05-21T21:15:46Z
"Photometric observations of Supernovae 2000E, 2001B, 2001V, and 2001X","CCD BVRI photometry is presented for two type Ia supernovae 2000E and 2001V,
for SN Ib 2001B and SN II-P 2001X. The parameters of light curves and absolute
magnitudes at maximum light are estimated. It is shown that all four supernovae
are typical for their classes considering the shape of their light curves and
maximum luminosity.",2006-03-27T11:42:58Z
"Solar dynamo models with alpha-effect and turbulent pumping from local
  3D convection calculations","(abridged) Results from kinematic solar dynamo models employing alpha-effect
and turbulent pumping from local convection calculations are presented. We
estimate the magnitude of these effects to be around 2-3 m/s. The rotation
profile of the Sun as obtained from helioseismology is applied. We obtain an
estimate of the ratio of the two induction effects, C_alpha/C_Omega \approx
10^-3, which we keep fixed in all models. We also include a one-cell meridional
circulation pattern having a magnitude of 10-20 m/s near the surface and 1-2
m/s at the bottom of the convection zone. The model essentially represents a
distributed turbulent dynamo, as the alpha-effect is nonzero throughout the
convection zone, although it concentrates near the bottom of the convection
zone obtaining a maximum around 30 degrees of latitude. Turbulent pumping of
the mean fields is predominantly down- and equatorward. We find that, when all
these effects are included in the model, it is possible to correctly reproduce
many features of the solar activity cycle, namely the correct equatorward
migration at low latitudes and the polar branch at high latitudes, and the
observed negative sign of B_r B_phi. Although the activity clearly shifts
towards the equator in comparison to previous models due to the combined action
of the alpha-effect peaking at midlatitudes, meridional circulation and
latitudinal pumping, most of the activity still occurs at too high latitudes
(between 5-60 degrees). Other problems include the relatively narrow parameter
space within which the preferred solution is dipolar (A0), and the somewhat too
short cycle lengths of the solar-type solutions. The role of the surface shear
layer is found to be important only in the case where the alpha-effect has an
appreciable magnitude near the surface.",2006-06-05T09:31:01Z
Giant Pulses in Pulsar PSR J1752+2359,"We report the detection of Giant Pulses (GPs) in the pulsar PSR J1752+2359.
The energy of the strongest GP exceeds the energy of the average pulse by a
factor of 200, in which it stands out from all known pulsars with GPs. PSR
J1752+2359 as well as the previously detected PSR B0031-07 and PSR B1112+50,
belongs to the first group of pulsars found to have GPs without a high magnetic
field at the light cylinder.",2006-05-03T09:59:52Z
"Supermassive black hole formation during the assembly of pre-galactic
  discs","In this paper we discuss the evolution of gravitationally unstable
pre-galactic discs that result from the collapse of haloes at high redshift $z
\approx 10$ or so, which have not yet been enriched by metals. In cases where
molecular hydrogen formation is suppressed the discs are maintained at a
temperature of a few thousand degrees Kelvin. However, when molecular hydrogen
is present cooling can proceed down to a few hundred degrees Kelvin. Analogous
to the case of the larger scale proto-galactic discs, we assume that the
evolution of these discs is mainly driven by angular momentum redistribution
induced by the development of gravitational instabilities in the disc. We also
properly take into account the possibility of disc fragmentation. We thus show
that this simple model naturally predicts the formation of supermassive black
holes in the nuclei of such discs and provides a robust determination of their
mass distribution as a function of halo properties. We estimate that roughly 5%
of discs resulting from the collapse of haloes with $M\approx 10^7 M_{\odot}$
should host a massive black hole with a mass $M_{\rm BH}\approx 10^5
M_{\odot}$. We confirm our arguments with time-dependent calculations of the
evolution of the surface density and of the accretion rate in these primordial
discs. This mechanism offers an efficient way to form seed black holes at high
redshift. The predicted masses for our black hole seeds enable the comfortable
assembly of $10^9 M_{\odot}$ black holes powering the luminous quasars detected
by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at $z = 6$ for a concordance cosmology.

Sensitivity and figures of merit for dark energy supernovae surveys,"Tracking the origin of the accelerating expansion of the Universe remains one
of the most challenging research activities today. The final answer will depend
on the precision and on the consistency of future data. The sensitivity of
future surveys and the control of the errors are crucial. We focus on futur
supernovae surveys in the light of the figure of merit defined by the Dark
Energy Task Force. We compare different optimisation and emphasize the
importance of the understanding of the systematic error level in this approach
and their impact on the conclusions. We discuss different representations of
the results to distinguish $\Lambda$CDM from other theoretical models. We
conclude that all representations should be controlled through combined
analyses and consistency checks to avoid some bias.",2006-07-26T12:52:54Z
SiO Maser Survey of the Inner Bar of the Galactic Bulge,"We surveyed 291 MSX/2MASS infrared objects in the 7 x 2 deg area of the
galactic center in the 43 GHz SiO J=1--0 v=1 and 2 maser lines, obtaining
accurate radial velocities of 163 detected objects. The surveyed area is the
region where the IRAS catalog is incomplete due to contamination by high source
density. The objects in the present MSX/2MASS sample were chosen to have
similar infrared characteristics to those of the previous SiO-maser-survey
samples based on the color selected IRAS sources. The sampling based on the
2MASS catalog causes a bias to the foreside objects of the bulge due to heavy
obscuration by interstellar dust; the detections are considerably leaned on the
V_{lsr}<0 side. The l--v diagram reveals two conspicuous features, which were
not present or tenuous in the previous studies: one feature indicating a linear
velocity increase with longitude with |l|<1.5 deg, which is likely associated
with the inner bar, and the other feature having considerably eccentric
velocities more than those of the normal x_1-orbit family feature. The
extinction-corrected K magnitudes (if used as a distance modulus) tend to show
a sequential deposition of these objects along the line of sight toward the
Galactic center depending on their radial velocities. The tendency that
appeared in the distance measures is consistent with the bulge-bar dynamical
model utilizing the periodic orbit families in the bar potential.",2006-05-09T06:18:04Z
Gravitational polarization and the phenomenology of MOND,"The modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) has been proposed as an alternative to
the dark matter paradigm; the philosophy behind is that there is no dark matter
and we witness a violation of the Newtonian law of dynamics. In this article,
we interpret differently the phenomenology sustaining MOND, as resulting from
an effect of ""gravitational polarization"", of some cosmic fluid made of dipole
moments, aligned in the gravitational field, and representing a new form of
dark matter. We invoke an internal force, of non-gravitational origin, in order
to hold together the microscopic constituents of the dipole. The dipolar
particles are weakly influenced by the distribution of ordinary matter; they
are accelerated not by the gravitational field, but by its gradient, or tidal
gravitational field.",2006-05-24T20:22:13Z
Monte Carlo radiative transfer in protoplanetary disks,"We present a new continuum 3D radiative transfer code, MCFOST, based on a
Monte-Carlo method. MCFOST can be used to calculate (i) monochromatic images in
scattered light and/or thermal emission, (ii) polarisation maps, (iii)
interferometric visibilities, (iv) spectral energy distributions and (v) dust
temperature distributions of protoplanetary disks. Several improvements to the
standard Monte Carlo method are implemented in MCFOST to increase efficiency
and reduce convergence time, including wavelength distribution adjustments,
mean intensity calculations and an adaptive sampling of the radiation field.
The reliability and efficiency of the code are tested against a previously
defined benchmark, using a 2D disk configuration. No significant difference (no
more than 10%, and generally much less) is found between the temperatures and
SEDs calculated by MCFOST and by other codes included in the benchmark. A study
of the lowest disk mass detectable by Spitzer, around young stars, is presented
and the colours of ``representative'' parametric disks are compared to recent
IRAC and MIPS Spitzer colours of solar-like young stars located in nearby star
forming regions.",2006-06-22T08:33:38Z
The distribution of ND2H in LDN1689N,"Finding tracers of the innermost regions of prestellar cores is important for
understanding their chemical and dynamical evolution before the onset of
gravitational collapse. While classical molecular tracers, such as CO and CS,
have been shown to be strongly depleted in cold, dense gas by condensation on
grain mantles, it has been a subject of discussion to what extent
nitrogen-bearing species, such as ammonia, are affected by this process. As
deuterium fractionation is efficient in cold, dense gas, deuterated species are
excellent tracers of prestellar cores. A comparison of the spatial distribution
of neutral and ionized deuterated species with the dust continuum emission can
thus provide important insights into the physical and chemical structure of
such regions. We study the spatial distribution of the ground-state 335.5 GHz
line of ND2H in LDN1689N, using APEX, and compare it with the distribution of
the DCO+(3--2) line, as well as the 350 micron dust continuum emission observed
with the SHARC~II bolometer camera at CSO. While the distribution of the ND2H
emission in LDN1689N is generally similar to that of the 350 microns dust
continuum emission, the peak of the ND2H emission is offset by ~10'' to the
East from the dust continuum and DCO+ emission peak. ND2H and ND3 share the
same spatial distribution. The observed offset between the ND2H and DCO+
emission is consistent with the hypothesis that the deuterium peak in LDN1689N
is an interaction region between the outflow shock from IRAS16293--2422 and the
dense ambient gas. We detect the J = 4 - 3 line of H13CO+ at 346.998 GHz in the
image side band serendipitously. This line shows the same spatial distribution
as DCO+(3--2), and peaks close to the 350 mic emission maximum which provides
further support for the shock interaction scenario.",2006-06-07T19:01:27Z
A Photonic mm-Wave Local Oscillator,"A photonic millimeter wave local oscillator capable of producing two
microwatts of radiated power at 224 GHz has been developed. The device was
tested in one antenna of Smithsonian Institution's Submillimeter Array (SMA)
and was found to produce stable phase on multiple baselines. Graphical data is
presented of correlator output phase and amplitude stability. A description of
the system is given in both open and closed loop modes. A model is given which
is used to predict the operational behavior. A novel method is presented to
determine the safe operating point of the automated system.",2006-05-31T02:18:13Z
"Trapping of magnetic flux by the plunge region of a black hole accretion
  disk","The existence of the radius of marginal stability means that accretion flows
around black holes invariably undergo a transition from a MHD turbulent
disk-like flow to an inward plunging flow. We argue that the plunging inflow
can greatly enhance the trapping of large scale magnetic field on the black
hole, and therefore may increase the importance of the Blandford-Znajek (BZ)
effect relative to previous estimates that ignore the plunge region. We support
this hypothesis by constructing and analyzing a toy-model of the dragging and
trapping of a large scale field by a black hole disk, revealing a strong
dependence of this effect on the effective magnetic Prandtl number of the MHD
turbulent disk. Furthermore, we show that the enhancement of the BZ effect
depends on the geometric thickness of the accretion disk. This may be, at least
in part, the physical underpinnings of the empirical relation between the
inferred geometric thickness of a black hole disk and the presence of a radio
jet.",2006-07-17T14:23:56Z
"Quasars Probing Quasars II: The Anisotropic Clustering of Optically
  Thick Absorbers around Quasars","With close pairs of quasars at different redshifts, a background quasar
sightline can be used to study a foreground quasar's environment in absorption.
We used a sample of 17 Lyman limit systems with column density N_HI > 10^19
cm^-2 selected from 149 projected quasar pair sightlines, to investigate the
clustering pattern of optically thick absorbers around luminous quasars at z ~
2.5. Specifically, we measured the quasar-absorber correlation function in the
transverse direction, and found a comoving correlation length of
r_0=9.2_{+1.5}_{-1.7} Mpc/h (comoving) assuming a power law correlation
function, with gamma=1.6. Applying this transverse clustering strength to the
line-of-sight, would predict that ~ 15-50% of all quasars should show a N_HI >
10^19 cm^-2 absorber within a velocity window of v < 3000 km/s. This
overpredicts the number of absorbers along the line-of-sight by a large factor,
providing compelling evidence that the clustering pattern of optically thick
absorbers around quasars is highly anisotropic. The most plausible
explanationfor the anisotropy is that the transverse direction is less likely
to be illuminated by ionizing photons than the line-of-sight, and that
absorbers along the line-of-sight are being photoevaporated. A simple model for
the photoevaporation of absorbers subject to the ionizing flux of a quasar is
presented, and it is shown that absorbers with volume densities n_H < 0.1 cm^-3
will be photoevaporated if they lie within ~ 1 Mpc (proper) of a luminous
quasar. Using this simple model, we illustrate how comparisons of the
transverse and line-of-sight clustering around quasars can ultimately be used
to constrain the distribution of gas in optically thick absorption line
systems.",2006-06-05T05:45:36Z
"Probing the Proper Motion of the Central Compact Object in Puppis-A with
  the Chandra High Resolution Camera","By making use of the sub-arcsecond angular resolution of the High Resolution
Camera (HRC-I) aboard the Chandra X-ray satellite we have examined the central
compact object RX J0822-4300, in the supernova remnant Puppis-A for a possible
proper motion. Using data which span an epoch of 1952 days we found the
position of RX J0822-4300, different by $0.574\pm0.184$ arcsec, implying a
proper motion of $\mu=107.49\pm34.46$ mas/yr. For a distance of 2.2 kpc, this
proper motion is equivalent to a recoil velocity of $1121.79\pm 359.60$ km/s.
The position angle is found to be $241^\circ \pm 24^\circ$. Since both the
magnitude and direction of the proper motion are in agreement with the birth
place of RX J0822-4300, being near to the optical expansion center of the
supernova remnant, the result presented in this letter is a promising
indication of a fast moving compact object in a supernova remnant. Although the
positional shift inferred from the current data is significant at a
$\sim3\sigma$ level only, one or more future HRC-I observations can obtain a
much larger positional separation and further constrain the measurement.",2006-06-30T10:39:20Z
"GRB 060121: Implications of a Short/Intermediate Duration Gamma-Ray
  Burst at High Redshift","Since the discovery of the first short-hard gamma-ray burst afterglows in
2005, the handful of observed events have been found to be embedded in nearby
(z < 1), bright underlying galaxies. We present multiwavelength observations of
the short-duration burst GRB 060121, which is the first observed to clearly
outshine its host galaxy (by a factor >10^2). A photometric redshift for this
event places the progenitor at a most probable redshift of z = 4.6, with a less
probable scenario of z = 1.7. In either case, GRB 060121 could be the
farthermost short-duration GRB detected to date and implies an
isotropic-equivalent energy release in gamma-rays comparable to that seen in
long-duration bursts. We discuss the implications of the released energy on the
nature of the progenitor. These results suggest that GRB 060121 may belong to a
family of energetic short-duration events, lying at z > 1 and whose optical
afterglows would outshine their host galaxies, unlike the first short-duration
GRBs observed in 2005. The possibility of GRB 060121 being an intermediate
duration burst is also discussed.",2006-05-19T21:44:34Z
"Dust Destruction in the High-Velocity Shocks Driven by Supernovae in the
  Early Universe","We investigate the destruction of dust grains by sputtering in the
high-velocity interstellar shocks driven by supernovae (SNe) in the early
universe to reveal the dependence of the time-scale of dust destruction on the
gas density $n_{{\rm H}, 0}$ in the interstellar medium (ISM) as well as on the
progenitor mass $M_{\rm pr}$ and explosion energy $E_{\rm 51}$ of SN. The
sputtering yields for the combinations of dust and ion species of interest to
us are evaluated by applying the so-called universal relation with a slight
modification. The dynamics of dust grains and their destruction by sputtering
in shock are calculated by taking into account the size distribution of each
dust species, together with the time evolution of temperature and density of
gas in spherically symmetric shocks. The results of calculations show that the
efficiency of dust destruction depends not only on the sputtering yield but
also on the initial size distribution of each grain species. The efficiency of
dust destruction increases with increasing $E_{\rm 51}$ and/or increasing
$n_{{\rm H}, 0}$, but is almost independent of $M_{\rm pr}$ as long as $E_{\rm
51}$ is the same. The mass of gas swept up by shock is the increasing function
of $E_{\rm 51}$ and the decreasing function of $n_{{\rm H}, 0}$. Combining
these results, we present the approximation formula for the time-scale of
destruction for each grain species in the early universe as a function of
$E_{\rm 51}$ and $n_{{\rm H}, 0}$. This formula is applicable for investigating
the evolution of dust grains at the early epoch of the universe with the
metallicity of $Z \la 10^{-3}$ $Z_\odot$. The effects of the cooling processes
of gas on the destruction of dust are briefly discussed.",2006-05-08T04:47:51Z
"On the role of continuum-driven eruptions in the evolution of very
  massive stars and Population III stars","We suggest that the mass lost during the evolution of very massive stars may
be dominated by optically thick, continuum-driven outbursts or explosions,
instead of by steady line-driven winds. In order for a massive star to become a
WR star, it must shed its H envelope, but new estimates of the effects of
clumping in winds indicate that line driving is vastly insufficient. We discuss
massive stars above roughly 40-50 Msun, for which the best alternative is mass
loss during brief eruptions of luminous blue variables (LBVs). Our clearest
example of this phenomenon is the 19th century outburst of eta Car, when the
star shed 12-20 Msun or more in less than a decade. Other examples are
circumstellar nebulae of LBVs, extragalactic eta Car analogs (``supernova
impostors''), and massive shells around SNe and GRBs. We do not yet fully
understand what triggers LBV outbursts, but they occur nonetheless, and present
a fundamental mystery in stellar astrophysics. Since line opacity from metals
becomes too saturated, the extreme mass loss probably arises from a
continuum-driven wind or a hydrodynamic explosion, both of which are
insensitive to metallicity. As such, eruptive mass loss could have played a
pivotal role in the evolution and fate of massive metal-poor stars in the early
universe. If they occur in these Population III stars, such eruptions would
profoundly affect the chemical yield and types of remnants from early SNe and
hypernovae.",2006-06-07T20:35:57Z
Mapping Global Star Formation in the Interacting Galaxy Pair ARP 32,"A multi-wavelength set of photometric data including UV (GALEX), optical,
near-IR, infrared (Spitzer) and radio (VLA 20cm) images and spectroscopic
observations are used to map the dust-obscured and unobscured star formation in
the galaxy pair ARP 32. The system consists of an actively star-forming galaxy
and another one with depressed star formation. The most active galaxy has
disrupted morphology and different sites of star formation. Spectroscopic data
show hints of nuclear activity in its core, intense star formation in limited
regions of the galaxy as well as an underlying population of stars witnessing a
past episode of star formation. Current star formation rates are estimated from
UV and bolometric IR luminosities.",2006-04-12T16:03:07Z
"Unconstrained Astrometric Orbits for Hipparcos Stars with Stochastic
  Solutions","A considerable number of astrometric binaries whose positions on the sky do
not obey the standard model of mean position, parallax and linear proper
motion, were observed by the Hipparcos satellite. Some of them remain
non-discovered, and their observational data have not been properly processed
with the more adequate astrometric model that includes nonlinear orbital
motion. We develop an automated algorithm based on ""genetic optimization"", to
solve the orbital fitting problem with no prior information about the orbital
elements is available (from, e.g., spectroscopic data or radial velocity
monitoring). We test this method on Hipparcos stars with known orbital
solutions in the catalog, and further apply it to stars with stochastic
solutions, which may be unresolved binaries. At a confidence level of 99%,
orbital fits are obtained for 65 stars, most of which have not been known as
binary. A few of the new probable binaries with A-type primaries with periods
444-2015 d are chemically peculiar stars, including Ap and \lambda Boo type.
The anomalous spectra of these stars are explained as admixture of the light
from the unresolved, sufficiently bright and massive companions. We estimate
the apparent orbits of four stars which have been identified as members of the
300 Myr-old UMa kinematic group. Another four new nearby binaries may include
low-mass M-type or brown dwarf companions. Similar astrometric models and
algorithms can be used for binary stars and planet hosts observed by SIM
PlanetQuest and Gaia.",2006-06-13T04:47:14Z
"The Spitzer c2d Survey of Nearby Dense Cores: I: First Direct Detection
  of the Embedded Source in IRAM 04191+1522","We report the first detections of the Class 0 protostellar source IRAM
04191+1522 at wavelengths shortward of 60 microns with the Spitzer Space
Telescope. We see extended emission in the Spitzer images that suggests the
presence of an outflow cavity in the circumstellar envelope. We combine the
Spitzer observations with existing data to form a complete dataset ranging from
3.6 to 1300 microns and use these data to construct radiative transfer models
of the source. We conclude that the internal luminosity of IRAM 04191+1522,
defined to be the sum of the luminosity from the internal sources (a star and a
disk), is L_int = 0.08 +/- 0.04 L_sun, placing it among the lowest luminosity
protostars known. Though it was discovered before the launch of the Spitzer
Space Telescope, IRAM 04191+1522 falls within a new class of Very Low
Luminosity Objects being discovered by Spitzer. Unlike the two other
well-studied objects in this class, which are associated either with weak,
compact outflows or no outflows at all, IRAM 04191+1522 has a well-defined
molecular outflow with properties consistent with those expected based on
relations derived from higher luminosity (L_int > 1 L_sun) protostars. We
discuss the difficulties in understanding IRAM 04191+1522 in the context of the
standard model of star formation, and suggest a possible explanation for the
very low luminosity of this source.",2006-07-31T01:47:22Z
Shoemaker-Levy 9 Impact Modeling: I. High-Resolution 3D Bolides,"We have run high-resolution, three-dimensional, hydrodynamic simulations of
the impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 into the atmosphere of Jupiter. We find
that the energy deposition profile is largely similar to the previous
two-dimensional calculations of Mac Low and Zahnle (1994), though perhaps
somewhat broader in the range of height over which the energy is deposited. As
with similar calculations for impacts into the Venusian atmosphere, there is
considerable sensitivity in the results to small changes in the initial
conditions, indicating dynamical chaos. We calculated the median depth of
energy deposition (the height z at which 50% of the bolide's energy has been
released) per run. The mean value among runs is approx 70 km below the 1-bar
level, for a 1-km diameter impactor of porous ice of density rho=0.6 g cm^{-3}.
The standard deviation among these runs is 14 km. We find little evidence of a
trend in these results with the resolution of the calculations (up to 57 cells
across the impactor radius, or 8.8-m resolution), suggesting that resolutions
as low as 16 grid cells across the radius of the bolide may yield good results
for this particular quantity.",2006-04-04T20:15:55Z
The H.E.S.S. View of the Central 200 Parsecs,"The inner few hundred parsecs of our galaxy provide a laboratory for the
study of the production and propagation of energetic particles.
Very-high-energy gamma-rays provide an effective probe of these processes and,
especially when combined with data from other wave-bands, gamma-rays
observations are a powerful diagnostic tool. Within this central region, data
from the H.E.S.S. instrument have revealed three discrete sources of
very-high-energy gamma-rays and diffuse emission correlated with the
distribution of molecular material. Here I provide an overview of these recent
results from H.E.S.S.",2006-07-15T14:42:52Z
Proto-Clusters with Evolved Populations around Radio Galaxies at z~2.5,"We report a discovery of proto-cluster candidates around high redshift radio
galaxies at z~2.5 on the basis of clear statistical excess of colour-selected
galaxies around them seen in the deep near-infrared imaging data obtained with
CISCO on Subaru Telescope. We have observed six targets, all at similar
redshifts at z~2.5, and our data reach to J=23.5, H=22.6 and K=21.8 (5 sigma)
and cover a 1.6' x 1.6' field centered on each radio galaxy. We apply colour
cuts in JHKs in order to exclusively search for galaxies located at high
redshifts, z>2. Over the magnitude range of 19.5<K<21.5 we see a significant
excess of red galaxies with J-K>2.3 by a factor of two around the combined
radio galaxies fields compared to those found in the general field of GOODS
South. The excess of galaxies around the radio galaxies fields becomes more
than factor of three around 19.5<K<20.5 when the two-colours cuts are applied
with JHKs. Such overdensity of the colour-selected galaxies suggest that those
fields tend to host high density regions at high redshifts, although there
seems to be the variety of the density of the colour-selected galaxies in each
field. In particular, two radio galaxies fields out of the six observed fields
show very strong density excess and these are likely to be proto-clusters
associated to the radio galaxies which would evolve into rich clusters of
galaxies dominated by old passively evolving galaxies.",2006-06-16T14:01:21Z
"Shadows and Photoevaporated Flows from Neutral Clumps Exposed to Two
  Ionizing Sources","Neutral clumps immersed in HII regions are frequently found in star formation
regions. We investigate here the formation of tail of neutral gas, which are
not reached by the direct ionizing flux coming from two massive stars, using
both an analytical approximation, that allows us to estimate the shadow
geometry behind the clumps for different initial geometric configurations, and
three-dimensional numerical simulations. We found a good agreement between both
approaches to this theoretically interesting problem. A particularly important
application could be the proplyds that are found in the Trapezium cluster in
Orion, which are being photoevaporated primordially by the O stars theta-1 Ori
C and theta-2 Ori A.",2006-05-24T13:24:13Z
"The Araucaria Project. An Accurate Distance to the Local Group Galaxy
  NGC 6822 from Near-Infrared Photometry of Cepheid Variables","We have measured near-infrared magnitudes in the J and K bands for 56 Cepheid
variables in the Local Group galaxy NGC 6822 with well-determined periods and
optical light curves in the V and I bands. Using the template light curve
approach of Soszynski, Gieren and Pietrzynski, accurate mean magnitudes were
obtained from these data which allowed us to determine with unprecedented
accuracy the distance to NGC 6822 from a multi-wavelength period-luminosity
solution in the VIJK bands. From our data, we obtain a distance to NGC 6822 of
(m-M)_{0} = 23.312 +- 0.021 (random error) mag, with an additional systematic
uncertainty of about 3 %. This distance value is tied to an assumed LMC
distance modulus of 18.50. From our multiwavelength approach, we find for the
total (average) reddening to the NGC 6822 Cepheids E(B-V) = 0.356 +- 0.013 mag,
which is in excellent agreement with a previous determination of McGonegal et
al. from near-infrared photometry and implies significant internal reddening of
the Cepheids in NGC 6822. Our present, definitive distance determination of NGC
6822 from Cepheids agrees within 2 % with the previous distance we had derived
from optical photometry alone, but has significantly reduced error bars.
  Our Cepheid distance to NGC 6822 is in excellent agreement with the recent
independent determination of Cioni and Habing from the I-band magnitude of the
tip of the red giant branch. It also agrees well, within the errors, with the
early determination of McGonegal et al. (1983) from random-phase H-band
photometry of nine Cepheids.",2006-05-09T12:41:05Z
A quantum-mechanical study of rotational transitions in H2 induced by H,"Cross sections have been computed for rotational transitions of H2, induced
by collisions with H atoms, using a recent H - H2 potential calculated by
Mielke et al. [1]. These results are compared with those obtained with earlier
potentials. Significant discrepancies are found with results deriving from the
potential of Boothroyd et al. [3] in the low collision energy regime. We
compare also cross sections derived using different levels of approximation to
the vibrational motion.",2006-05-30T10:41:51Z
"On the Unusual Depletions toward Sk 155, or What Are the Small
  Magellanic Cloud Dust Grains Made of?","The dust in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), an ideal analog of primordial
galaxies at high redshifts, differs markedly from that in the Milky Way by
exhibiting a steeply rising far-ultraviolet extinction curve, an absence of the
2175 Angstrom extinction feature, and a local minimum at ~12 micron in its
infrared emission spectrum, suggesting the lack of ultrasmall carbonaceous
grains (i.e. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules) which are ubiquitously
seen in the Milky Way. While current models for the SMC dust all rely heavily
on silicates, recent observations of the SMC sightline toward Sk 155 indicated
that Si and Mg are essentially undepleted and the depletions of Fe range from
mild to severe, suggesting that metallic grains and/or iron oxides, instead of
silicates, may dominate the SMC dust. However, in this Letter we apply the
Kramers-Kronig relation to demonstrate that neither metallic grains nor iron
oxides are capable of accounting for the observed extinction; silicates remain
as an important contributor to the extinction, consistent with current models
for the SMC dust.",2006-03-21T15:52:47Z
The X-ray properties of the dwarf Magellanic-type galaxy NGC 55,"We present an analysis of the X-ray properties of the Magellanic-type galaxy
NGC 55 based on two contiguous XMM-Newton observations. We detect a total of
137 X-ray sources in the field of view, 42 of which are located within the
optical confines of the galaxy. On the basis of X-ray colour classification and
after correcting for background objects, we conclude that our source sample
includes ~ 20 X-ray binaries, 5 supernova remnants and 7 very soft sources
(including 2 good candidate supersoft sources) associated with NGC 55. Detailed
spectral and timing analysis was carried out on 4 of the brightest X-ray
sources. One of these objects is identified with a Galactic foreground star and
is a possible new RS CVn system. The other three are consistent with accreting
X-ray binaries, though further evidence of short term variability is required
to confirm this. We also find evidence of an underlying component, which is
concentrated on the bar region but has an extent of at least 6' (3 kpc) in the
plane of the galaxy and +/- 1' (+/- 500 pc) perpendicular to it. This emission
is best fitted by a thermal plasma plus power-law model but with high intrinsic
absorption consistent with its location in the central disc of the galaxy. We
interpret the soft component as diffuse thermal emission linked to regions of
current star formation, whilst the hard power-law component may originate in
unresolved X-ray binary sources. The intrinsic luminosity of this residual disc
emission may exceed Lx ~ 6e38 ergs/s (0.3-6 keV). A comparison with other
Magellanic systems confirms that, in terms of both its discrete X-ray source
population and its extended emission, NGC 55 has X-ray properties which are
typical of its class.",2006-04-27T23:13:40Z
"Transverse and longitudinal correlation functions in the Intergalactic
  Medium from 32 close pairs of high-redshift quasars","We present the transverse flux correlation function of the Lyman-alpha forest
in quasar absorption spectra at z~2.1 from VLT-FORS and VLT-UVES observations
of a total of 32 pairs of quasars; 26 pairs with separations in the range
0.6<theta<4 arcmin and 6 pairs with 4<theta<10 arcmin. Correlation is detected
at the 3sigma level up to separations of the order of ~4 arcmin (or ~4.4 h^{-1}
Mpc comoving at z=2.1 for Omega_{m}=0.3 and Omega_{Lambda}=0.7). We have,
furthermore, measured the longitudinal correlation function at a somewhat
higher mean redshift (z=2.39) from 20 lines of sight observed with high
spectral resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio with VLT-UVES. We compare
the observed transverse and longitudinal correlation functions to that obtained
from numerical simulations and illustrate the effect of spectral resolution,
thermal broadening and peculiar motions. The shape and correlation length of
the correlation functions are in good agreement with those expected from
absorption by the filamentary and sheet-like structures in the photoionized
warm intergalactic medium predicted in CDM-like models for structures
formation. Using a sample of 139 C_{iv} systems detected along the lines of
sight toward the pairs of quasars we also investigate the transverse
correlation of metals on the same scales. The observed transverse correlation
function of intervening C_{iv} absorption systems is consistent with that of a
randomly distributed population of absorbers. This is likely due to the small
number of pairs with separation less than 2 arcmin. We detect, however, a
significant overdensity of systems in the sightlines towards the quartet
Q0103-294A&B, Q0102-2931 and Q0102-293 which extends over the redshift range
1.5<z<2.2 and an angular scale larger than 10 arcmin.",2006-05-24T09:13:50Z
"Likelihood methods for the combined analysis of CMB temperature and
  polarisation power spectra","We consider the shape of the likelihood and posterior surfaces to be used
when fitting cosmological models to CMB temperature and polarisation power
spectra measured from experiments. In the limit of an all-sky survey with
Gaussian distributed pixel noise we show that the true combined likelihood of
the four CMB power spectra (TT, TE, EE & BB) has a Wishart distribution and we
discuss the properties of this function. We compare various fits to the
posterior surface of the Cls, both in the case of a single auto-power spectrum
and for a combination of temperature and polarisation data. In the latter case,
it is important that the fits can accurately match the Wishart distribution in
the limit of near full-sky coverage. Simple extensions of auto-power spectrum
fits to include polarisation data generally fail to match correlations between
the different power spectra in this limit. Directly fitting pixel values on
large scales, as undertaken by the WMAP team in their analysis of the 3 year
data, avoids the complications of characterising the shape of the posterior for
the power spectra. Finally we demonstrate the importance of the likelihood
distribution on analytic marginalisation, and provide a formula for analytic
marginalisation over a calibration error given an all-sky survey.",2006-04-26T17:30:13Z
The Nature of SS433 and the Ultraluminous X-ray Sources,"The periodic precession (162--day) and nodding (6.3--day) motions of the jets
in SS433 are driven in the outer regions of the disc, whereas the jets
themselves, being relativistic, are launched near the black hole at the disc
centre. Given that the nutation period is comparable to the dynamical timescale
in the outer regions of the disc, it seems unlikely that these periods can be
communicated efficiently to the disc centre. Here we propose that the massive
outflow observed in SS433 is launched at large radii in the disc, about 1/10 of
the outer disc edge, and that it is this outflow which responds to the
oscillations of the outer disc and determines the direction of the jets. The
massive outflow is launched at large radius because the mass transfer rate is
hyper-Eddington. This implies not only that the total luminosity of SS433
exceeds $\le$ by a considerable factor, but also that the radiative output is
collimated along the outflow. We thus suggest that SS433 is an ultraluminous
X-ray source (ULX) viewed `from the side'. We also suggest that the obscured
{\it INTEGRAL} sources may be SS433--like objects, but with slightly lower mass
transfer rates.",2006-04-24T17:58:35Z
Crossing the phantom divide without phantom matter,"A class of braneworld models can lead to phantom-like acceleration of the
late universe, but without the need for any phantom matter. In the simplest
models, the universe contains only cold dark matter and a cosmological
constant. We generalize these models by introducing a quintessence field. The
new feature in our models is that quintessence leads to a crossing of the
phantom divide, $w=-1$. This is a purely gravitational effect, and there is no
phantom instability. Furthermore, the Hubble parameter is always decreasing,
and there is no big rip singularity in the future.",2006-05-18T11:29:19Z
Luminous superclusters: remnants from inflation,"We derive the luminosity and multiplicity functions of superclusters compiled
for the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Data Release
4), and for three samples of simulated superclusters. We find for all
supercluster samples Density Field (DF) clusters, which represent high-density
peaks of the class of Abell clusters, and use median luminosities/masses of
richness class 1 DF-clusters to calculate relative luminosity/mass functions.
We show that the fraction of very luminous (massive) superclusters in real
samples is more than tenfolds greater than in simulated samples. Superclusters
are generated by large-scale density perturbations which evolve very slowly.
The absence of very luminous superclusters in simulations can be explained
either by non-proper treatment of large-scale perturbations, or by some yet
unknown processes in the very early Universe.",2006-05-16T17:03:56Z
"The Integral Field Unit for the Echellette Spectrograph and Imager at
  Keck II","We report on the design, development and commissioning of an Integral Field
Unit (IFU) that has been built for the Echellette Spectrograph and Imager (ESI)
at the W.M. Keck Observatory. This image slicer--based IFU, which was
commissioned in the spring of 2004 covers a contiguous field of 5.65 x 4.0
arcseconds in 5 slices that are 1.13 arcseconds wide. The IFU passes a spectral
range of 0.39-1.1 um with a throughput of between 45 % and 60 % depending on
wavelength and field position. The IFU head resides in an ESI slit mask holder,
so that ESI may be converted to the IFU mode remotely by selecting the
appropriate slit mask position. This IFU is the first of a family of designs
for the spectrograph, providing a range of field-coverages and dispersions. In
addition, we present the first-light science imaging and spectroscopic
observations of RXJ1131-123, a low-redshift, lensed quasar. These observations
show the 4 spectra of the lens and lensed-images captured in a single pointing.",2006-06-07T22:13:48Z
Merging of a massive binary due to ejection of bound stars,"From the results of numerical scattering experiments and simulations of a
massive black hole binary in spherically symmetric and shallow cores it has
been deduced that most likely the shrinking process stalls due to loss-cone
depletion before emission of gravitational radiation becomes important. Here we
follow a different approach and focus on the population of stars which is bound
to the binary and so far has not received much attention. With simple
assumptions which should not be sensitive to initial conditions we derive a
lower limit for the mass of stars which needs to be ejected by the binary in
order to coalesce. We also compute this mass in dependence on the steepness of
the density profile according to which the stars are distributed. Our results
are not as pessimistic as earlier conclusions and actually suggest that the BHs
merge.",2006-05-24T09:15:48Z
The Connection Between Barstrength and Circumnuclear Dust Structure,"We present a comparison of barstrength Qb and circumnuclear dust morphology
for 75 galaxies in order to investigate how bars affect the centers of
galaxies. We trace the circumnuclear dust morphology and amount of dust
structure with structure maps generated from visible-wavelength HST data,
finding that tightly wound nuclear dust spirals are primarily found in weakly
barred galaxies. While strongly barred galaxies sometimes exhibit grand design
structure within the central 10 percent of D25, this structure rarely extends
to within ~10 pc of the galaxy nucleus. In some galaxies, these spiral arms
terminate at a circumnuclear starburst ring. Galaxies with circumnuclear rings
are generally more strongly barred than galaxies lacking rings. Within these
rings, the dust structure is fairly smooth and usually in the form of a loosely
wound spiral. These data demonstrate that multiple nuclear morphologies are
possible in the most strongly barred galaxies: chaotic central dust structure
inconsistent with a coherent nuclear spiral, a grand design spiral that loses
coherence before reaching the nucleus, or a grand design spiral that ends in a
circumnuclear ring. These observations may indicate that not all strong bars
are equally efficient at fueling material to the centers of their host
galaxies. Finally, we investigate the longstanding hypothesis that SB(s)
galaxies have weak bars and SB(r) galaxies have strong bars, finding the
opposite to be the case: namely, SB(r) galaxies are less strongly barred and
have less dust structure than SB(s) galaxies. In general, more strongly barred
galaxies tend to have higher nuclear dust contrast.",2006-06-19T20:30:22Z
Terrestrial Planet Formation Surrounding Close Binary Stars,"Disk material has been observed around both components of some young close
binary star systems. It has been shown that if planets form at the right places
within such disks, they can remain dynamically stable for very long times.
Herein, we numerically simulate the late stages of terrestrial planet growth in
circumbinary disks around 'close' binary star systems with stellar separations
between 0.05 AU and 0.4 AU and binary eccentricities up to 0.8. In each
simulation, the sum of the masses of the two stars is 1 solar mass, and giant
planets are included. Our results are statistically compared to a set of planet
formation simulations in the Sun-Jupiter-Saturn system that begin with
essentially the same initial disk of protoplanets. The planetary systems formed
around binaries with apastron distances less than ~ 0.2 AU are very similar to
those around single stars, whereas those with larger maximum separations tend
to be sparcer, with fewer planets, especially interior to 1 AU. We also provide
formulae that can be used to scale results of planetary accretion simulations
to various systems with different total stellar mass, disk sizes, and
planetesimal masses and densities.",2006-07-11T19:36:55Z
Interstellar Dust at the Magnetic Wall of the Heliosphere. II,"Several sets of data show that small interstellar grains captured in
interstellar magnetic fields draped over the heliosphere appear to polarize the
light of nearby stars. The maximum polarization direction is offset in ecliptic
longitude by about +35 from the upwind direction, and the polarization peak is
enhanced for stars near the ecliptic plane. A band of weak polarization
stretches through the southern ecliptic hemisphere to the downwind direction.
The interstellar field at the heliosphere is directed towards l=105 deg,
forming an angle of about 75 deg. with the inflowing gas. Grain alignment is
stable in the low density LIC, and is disrupted about 600 times more slowly
than in dense clouds. The polarization vanishes where the outer heliosheath
magnetic fields become tangled or reconnect. The dust in the local cloud
appears to be primarily olivines. The distribution of polarization depends on
the solar cycle phase.",2006-03-28T17:45:06Z
"A Comprehensive Study of 2 000 Narrow Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies from the
  Sloan Digital Sky Survey: I. The Sample","This is the first paper in a series dedicated to the study of the
emission-line and continuum properties of narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies
(NLS1s). We carried out a systematic search for NLS1s from objects assigned as
``QSOs'' or ``galaxies'' in the spectroscopic sample of the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey Data Release 3 (SDSS DR3) by a careful modeling of their emission lines
and continua. The result is a uniform sample comprising $\sim 2~000$ NLS1. This
sample dramatically increases the number of known NLS1 by a factor of $\sim 10$
over previous compilations. This paper presents the parameters of the prominent
emission lines and continua, which were measured accurately with typical
uncertainties $<10%$. Taking advantage of such an unprecedented large and
uniform sample with accurately measured spectral parameters, we carried out
various statistical analysis, some of which were only possible for the first
time (abbreviated).",2006-03-28T11:28:58Z
"Luminosity functions for galaxies and quasars in the Spitzer Wide-Area
  Infrared Extra-galactic (SWIRE) Legacy survey","We construct rest-frame luminosity functions at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8 and 24
microns over the redshift range 0<z<2 for galaxies and 0<z<4 for optical QSOs,
using optical and infrared data from the Spitzer Wide-area InfraRed
Extragalactic survey. The 3.6 and 4.5 micron galaxy LFs show evidence for
moderate positive luminosity evolution up to z~1.5, consistent with the passive
ageing of evolved stellar populations. Their comoving luminosity density was
found to evolve passively, gradually increasing out to z~0.5-1 but flattening,
or even declining, at higher redshift. Conversely, the 24 micron galaxy LF,
which is more sensitive to obscured star formation and/or AGN activity,
undergoes strong positive evolution, with the derived IR energy density and SFR
density proportional to (1+z)^gamma with gamma=4.5^{+0.7}_{-0.6} and the
majority of this evolution occurring since z~1. Optical QSOs, however, show
positive luminosity evolution in all bands, out to the highest redshifts
(3<z<4). Modelling as L* proportional to (1+z)^gamma gave
gamma=1.3^{+0.1}_{-0.1} at 3.6 micron, gamma=1.0^{+0.1}_{-0.1} at 4.5 micron
and stronger evolution at the longer wavelengths (5.8, 8 and 24 micron), of
gamma~3. Comparison of the galaxy LFs to predictions from a semi-analytic model
based on CDM indicate that an IMF skewed towards higher mass star formation in
bursts compared to locally is preferred. As a result the currently inferred
massive star formation rates in distant sub-mm sources may require substantial
downwards revision.",2006-05-11T20:31:19Z
"Intrinsic properties of the magnetically collimated water maser jet of
  W43A","Water maser polarization observations in the precessing jet of W43A have
revealed that it is magnetically collimated. Here we present a detailed
description of the physical properties of the water maser environment in the
jet. We discuss the maser saturation level and beaming angle as well as the
intrinsic temperatures and densities. Additionally, we show that the
polarization angle of the strongest red-shifted maser feature undergoes a fast
rotation of 90 degrees across the maser. Along with the variation of linear
polarization fraction, this strongly supports the current theoretical
description of maser linear polarization.",2006-07-14T16:07:37Z
"Spectral Statistics and Local Luminosity Function of a Hard X-ray
  Complete Sample of Brightest AGNs","We have measured the X-ray spectral properties of a complete flux-limited
sample of bright AGNs from HEAO-1 all-sky catalogs to investigate their
statistics and provide greater constraints on the bright-end of the hard X-ray
luminosity function (HXLF) of AGNs and the AGN population synthesis model of
the X-ray background. Spectral studies using data from ASCA, XMM-Newton and/or
Beppo-SAX observations have been made for almost all AGNs in this sample.
  The spectral measurements enable us to construct the neutral absorbing column
density (Log nH) distribution and separate HXLFs for absorbed (Log nH[cm-2]>
21.5) and unabsorbed AGNs in the local universe. Our results show evidence for
a difference in the shapes of HXLFs of absorbed and unabsorbed AGNs in that
absorbed AGN HXLF drops more rapidly at higher luminosities than that of
unabsorbed AGNs, which is similar to that previously reported. In the Lx - nH
plot, we found no AGN in the high-luminosity high-intrinsic absorption regime
(Log Lx[erg/s]> 44.5, Log nH[cm-2]> 21.5) in our sample, where we expect about
5 AGNs if we assume that absorbed and unabsorbed having identical AGN HXLF
shapes. We also find that the observed flux with ASCA or XMM-Newton is smaller
than that with HEAO-1 by a factor of 0.29 on average, which is expected for
re-observation of sources with a factor 2.5 variability amplitude scale.",2006-03-25T12:59:12Z
"Outer irregular satellites of the planets and their relationship with
  asteroids, comets and Kuiper Belt objects","Outer satellites of the planets have distant, eccentric orbits that can be
highly inclined or even retrograde relative to the equatorial planes of their
planets. These irregular orbits cannot have formed by circumplanetary accretion
and are likely products of early capture from heliocentric orbit. The irregular
satellites may be the only small bodies remaining which are still relatively
near their formation locations within the giant planet region. The study of the
irregular satellites provides a unique window on processes operating in the
young solar system and allows us to probe possible planet formation mechanisms
and the composition of the solar nebula between the rocky objects in the main
asteroid belt and the very volatile rich objects in the Kuiper Belt. The gas
and ice giant planets all appear to have very similar irregular satellite
systems irrespective of their mass or formation timescales and mechanisms.
Water ice has been detected on some of the outer satellites of Saturn and
Neptune whereas none has been observed on Jupiter's outer satellites.",2006-05-01T20:32:36Z
Cosmic tomographies: baryon acoustic oscillations and weak lensing,"We explore the complementarity between two tomographic probes of the
universe: baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) and weak lensing (WL). We find
that photometric measurements of BAOs alone do not provide very tight
constraints on the dark energy equation of state parameters, partially due to
our uncertain knowledge of the galaxy bias. WL, on the other hand, is adversely
impacted by the uncertainties of the probability distribution of photometric
redshift (photo-z) errors. A joint analysis of the two, however, is more robust
to these uncertainties and leads to a remarkable improvement over the results
of either probe alone.
  Forecasts of cosmological constraints are provided for various BAO and WL
surveys in combination with CMB measurements from Planck. In particular, we
find that the joint analysis of BAO and WL power spectra with the Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope can tighten the errors of the dark energy equation of
state (at a = 0.63) and its rate of change, respectively, to 0.016 and 0.16
(marginalized over 131 other parameters). With supernovae and cluster counting
as well as higher-order statistics of the same galaxy and shear data, one can
further improve the constraints.",2006-05-29T08:50:45Z
"A 3-Dimensional study of the Local Environment of Bright IRAS Galaxies:
  The AGN/Starburst connection","We present a 3-dimensional study of the local ($\leq 100 h^{-1}$ kpc) and the
large scale ($\leq$ 1 $h^{-1}$ Mpc) environment of Bright IRAS Galaxies
(BIRGs). For this purpose we use 87 BIRGs located at high galactic latitudes
(with 0.008$\leq z \leq$0.018) as well as a control sample of non-active
galaxies having the same morphological, redshift and diameter size
distributions as the corresponding BIRG sample. Using the Center for
Astrophysics (CfA2) and Southern Sky Redshift Survey (SSRS) galaxy catalogues
($m_b\lesssim 15.5$)as well as our own spectroscopic observations
($m_b\lesssim19.0$) for a subsample of the original BIRG sample, we find that
the fraction of BIRGs with a close neighbor is significantly higher than that
of their control sample. Comparing with a related analysis of Sy1 and Sy2
galaxies of Koulouridis et al. (2006) we find that BIRGs have a similar
environment as Sy2s, although the fraction of BIRGs with a bright close
neighbor is even higher than that of Sy2 galaxies. An additional analysis of
the relation between FIR colors and the type of activity of each BIRG shows a
significant difference between the colors of strongly-interacting and
non-interacting starbursts and a resemblance between the colors of
non-interacting starbursts and Sy2s. Our results support the view where close
interactions can drive molecular clouds towards the galactic center, triggering
starburst activity and obscuring the nuclear activity. When the close neighbor
moves away, starburst activity is reduced with the simultaneous appearance of
an obscured (type 2) AGN. Finally, the complete disentanglement of the pair
gives birth to an unobscured (type 1) AGN.",2006-06-14T22:02:34Z
CO emission from candidate photo-dissociation regions in M81,"Context At least a fraction of the atomic hydrogen in spiral galaxies is
suspected to be the result of molecular hydrogen which has been dissociated by
radiation from massive stars.
  Aims In this paper, we extend our earlier set of data from a small region of
the Western spiral arm of M81 with CO observations in order to study the
interplay between the radiation field and the molecular and atomic hydrogen.
  Methods We report CO(1-0) observations with the Nobeyama 45 m dish and the
Owens Valley interferometer array of selected regions in the Western spiral arm
of M81.
  Results From our Nobeyama data, we detect CO(1-0) emission at several
locations, coinciding spatially with HI features near a far-UV source. The
levels and widths of the detected CO profiles are consistent with the CO(1-0)
emission that can be expected from several large photo-dissociation regions
with typical sizes of some 50x150 pc located within our telescope beam. We do
not detect emission at other pointings, even though several of those are near
far-UV sources and accompanied by bright HI. This non-detection is likely a
consequence of the marginal area filling factor of photo-dissociation regions
in our observations. We detect no emission in our Owens Valley data, consistent
with the low intensity of the CO emission detected in that field by the
Nobeyama dish.
  Conclusions We explain the lack of CO(1-0) emission at positions farther from
far-UV sources as a consequence of insufficient heating and excitation of the
molecular gas at these positions, rather than as an absence of molecular
hydrogen.",2006-06-22T10:10:50Z
"Radio observations of comet 9P/Tempel 1 with the Australia Telescope
  facilities during the Deep Impact encounter","We present radio observations of comet 9P/Tempel 1 associated with the Deep
Impact spacecraft collision of 2005 July 4. Weak 18-cm OH emission was detected
with the Parkes 64-m telescope, in data averaged over July 4 to 6, at a level
of 12 +/- 3 mJy km/s, corresponding to OH production rate 2.8 x 10^{28}
molecules/second (Despois et al. inversion model, or 1.0 x 10^{28} /s for the
Schleicher & A'Hearn model). We did not detect the HCN 1-0 line with the Mopra
22-m telescope over the period July 2 to 6. The 3 sigma limit of 0.06 K km/s
for HCN on July 4 after the impact gives the limit to the HCN production rate
of < 1.8 x 10^{25} /s. We did not detect the HCN 1-0 line, 6.7 GHz CH_3OH line
or 3.4-mm continuum with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) on July
4, giving further limits on any small-scale structure due to an outburst. The 3
sigma limit on HCN emission of 2.5 K km/s from the ATCA around impact
corresponds to limit < 4 x 10^{29} HCN molecules released by the impact.",2006-04-24T08:38:12Z
The Scattering of Lyman-series Photons in the Intergalactic Medium,"We re-examine scattering of photons near the Lyman-alpha resonance in the
intergalactic medium (IGM). We first derive a general integral solution for the
radiation field around resonance when spin diffusivity is ignored. Our solution
shows explicitly that recoil sources an absorption feature, whose magnitude
increases with the relative importance of recoil compared to Doppler
broadening. This spectrum depends on the Lyman-alpha line profile, but
approximating it with the absorption profile appropriate to the Lorentzian
wings of natural broadening accurately reproduces the results for a full Voigt
profile so long as T<1000 K in the IGM. This approximation allows us to obtain
simple analytic formulae for the total scattering rate of Lyman-alpha photons
and the accompanying energy exchange rate. Our power series solutions converge
rapidly for photons that redshift into the Lyman-alpha resonance as well as for
photons injected at line center. We confirm previous calculations showing that
heating through this mechanism is quite slow and probably negligible compared
to other sources. We then show that energy exchange during the scattering of
higher-order Lyman-series photons can be much more important than naively
predicted by recoil arguments. However, the resulting heating is still
completely negligible.",2006-05-26T20:34:35Z
Ultraluminous X-ray Sources: Bubbles and Optical Counterparts,"Optical studies of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULX) in nearby galaxies have
turned out to be instrumental in discriminating between various models
including the much advertised intermediate mass black hole hypothesis and
various beaming scenarios. Here we report on ESO VLT and SUBARU observations of
ULX that have revealed the parent stellar clusters with ages of some 60 million
years in two cases. Thus we are able to derive upper limits of about 8 M_sun
for the mass donors in these systems. The optical counterparts are dominated by
X-ray heated accretion disks, and the discovery of the HeII4686 emission line
now allows to derive dynamical masses in these systems. Apparent radial
velocity variations of 300 km/s have been detected in NGC 1313 X-2 which, if
confirmed by further observations, would exclude the presence of IMBH in these
systems.",2006-03-28T17:29:35Z
"Cosmological evolution with a logarithmic correction in the dark energy
  entropy","In a thermodynamical model of cosmological FLRW event horizons for the dark
energy (DE), we consider a logarithmic corrective term in the entropy to which
corresponds a new term in the DE density. This model of $\Lambda (t)$ in an
interacting two-component cosmology with cold dark matter (DM) as second
component leads to a system of coupled equations, yielding, after numerical
resolution, the evolutions of $\Lambda (t)$, the Hubble $H(t)$, vacuum density
$\Omega \_{\Lambda}(t)$, deceleration $q(t)$ and statefinder $R(t)$ and $S(t)$
parameters. Its results, compatible with an initial inflation and the current
observations of the so-called ""concordance model"", predict a graceful exit of
early inflation and the present acceleration and solve in the same time the age
and coincidence problems. Moreover they account for the low-$l$ CMBR power
spectrum suppression.",2006-03-13T08:28:35Z
Compton Spectrum from Poynting Flux Accelerated e+e- Plasma,"We report the Compton scattering emission from the Poynting flux acceleration
of electron- positron plasma simulated by the 2-1/2 dimensional
particle-in-cell(PIC) code. We show these and other remarkable properties of
Poynting flux acceleration and Compton spectral output, and discuss the
agreement with the observed spectra of GRBs and XRFs.",2006-04-18T23:28:55Z
"Unipolar Inductor Model coupled to GW emission: energy budget and model
  application to RX J0806+15 and RX J1914+24","We further discuss the Unipolar Inductor Model (UIM) coupled to GW emission
(Dall'Osso et al. 2005) and compare it to observed properties of the two
candidate ultrashort period binaries RX J0806+15 and RX J1914+24 . We consider
the measured orbital periods, period derivatives and inferred X-ray
luminosities of these two sources and find constraints on system parameters in
order for the model to account for them. We find that these properties point to
the two sources being in different regimes of the UIM, with the requirement of
low magnetic moment primaries ($\sim 10^{30} G cm^3$) for both. Given this weak
magnetization, RX J0806+15 has a sufficiently low luminosity that it can be
interpreted as having a primary spin almost synchronous to and just slightly
slower than the orbital motion. Its measured orbital spin-up is only slightly
affected by spin-orbit coupling and is mostly due to GW emission. RX J1914+24,
on the other hand, is too bright in X-rays and has too slow an orbital spin-up
for the same regime to apply. We suggest that this binary system may be
emitting GWs at a significantly higher rate than implied by its measured
$\dot{\omega}_o = 6 \times 10^{-17} rad s^{-2}$. The latter is explained, in
this framework, by the primary spin being slightly faster than the orbital
motion ($\alpha <or= 1.1$). In this case, the associated spin-orbit coupling
transfers to the orbit a significant amount of angular momentum, thus partially
balancing that lost to GW emission. All expectations can be tested in the near
future to confirm the viability of the model.",2006-03-29T16:32:06Z
On the Disalignment of Interstellar Grains,"Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the alignment of grains with
the interstellar magnetic field, including paramagnetic dissipation, radiative
torques, and supersonic gas-grain streaming. These must compete with
disaligning processes, including randomly directed torques arising from
collisions with gas atoms. I describe a novel disalignment mechanism for grains
that have a time-varying electric dipole moment and that drift across the
magnetic field. Depending on the drift speed, this mechanism may yield a much
shorter disalignment timescale than that associated with random gas atom
impacts. For suprathermally rotating grains, the new disaligning process may be
more potent for carbonaceous dust than for silicate dust. This could result in
efficient alignment for silicate grains but poor alignment for carbonaceous
grains.",2006-03-11T16:29:19Z
Synchrotron flaring in the jet of 3C 279,"We study the synchrotron flaring behaviour of the blazar 3C279 based on an
extensive dataset covering 10 years of monitoring at 19 different frequencies
in the radio-to-optical range. The properties of a typical outburst are derived
from the observations by decomposing the 19 lightcurves into a series of
self-similar events. This analysis is achieved by fitting all data
simultaneously to a succession of outbursts defined according to the
shock-in-jet model of Marscher & Gear (1985). We compare the derived properties
of the synchrotron outbursts in 3C279 to those obtained with a similar method
for the quasar 3C273. It is argued that differences in the flaring behaviour of
these two sources are intrinsic to the sources themselves rather than being due
to orientation effects. We also compare the start times and flux densities of
our modelled outbursts with those measured from radio components identified in
Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) images. We find VLBI counterparts for
most of our model outbursts, although some high-frequency peaking events are
not seen in the radio maps. Finally, we study the link between the appearance
of a new synchrotron component and the EGRET gamma-ray state of the source at
10 different epochs. We find that an early-stage shock component is always
present during high gamma-ray states, while in low gamma-ray states the time
since the onset of the last synchrotron outburst is significantly longer. This
statistically significant correlation supports the idea that gamma-ray flares
are associated with the early stages of shock components propagating in the
jet. We note, however, that the shock wave is already beyond the broad line
region during the gamma-ray flaring.",2006-06-27T10:58:42Z
Mass-loss properties of S-stars on the AGB,"We have used a detailed non-LTE radiative transfer code to model new APEX
CO(J=3-2) data, and existing CO radio line data, on a sample of 40 AGB S-stars.
The derived mass-loss-rate distribution has a median value of 2E-7 Msun/yr, and
resembles values obtained for similar samples of M-stars and carbon stars.
Possibly, there is a scarcity of high-mass-loss-rate (>=1E-5 Msun/yr) S-stars.
The distribution of envelope gas expansion velocities is similar to that of the
M-stars, the median is 7.5 km/s, while the carbon stars, in general, have
higher gas expansion velocities. The mass-loss rate correlates well with the
gas expansion velocity, in accordance with results for M-stars and carbon
stars.",2006-05-26T13:54:47Z
"Interacting Dark Energy and Dark Matter: observational Constraints from
  Cosmological Parameters","Several observational constraints are imposed on the interacting holographic
model of Dark Energy and Dark Matter. First we use the age parameter today, as
given by the WMAP results. Subsequently, we explained the reason why it is
possible, as recently observed, for an old quasar to be observed in early
stages of the universe. We discuss this question in terms of the evolution of
the age parameter as well as in terms of the structure formation. Finally, we
give a detailed discussion of the constraints implied by the observed CMB low
$\ell$ suppression. As a result, the interacting holographic model has been
proved to be robust and with reasonable bounds predicts a non vanishing
interaction of Dark Energy and Dark Matter.",2006-07-07T07:09:32Z
"Population III star formation in a Lambda CDM universe, I: The effect of
  formation redshift and environment on protostellar accretion rate","(abridged) We perform 12 extremely high resolution adaptive mesh refinement
cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of Population III star formation in a
Lambda CDM universe, varying the box size and large-scale structure, to
understand systematic effects in the formation of primordial protostellar
cores. We find results that are qualitatively similar to those observed
previously. We observe that the threshold halo mass for formation of a
Population III protostar does not evolve significantly with time in the
redshift range studied (33 > z > 19) but exhibits substantial scatter due to
different halo assembly histories: Halos which assembled more slowly develop
cooling cores at lower mass than those that assemble more rapidly, in agreement
with Yoshida et al. (2003). We do, however, observe significant evolution in
the accretion rates of Population III protostars with redshift, with objects
that form later having higher maximum accretion rates, with a variation of two
orders of magnitude (10^-4 - 10^-2 Msolar/year). This can be explained by
considering the evolving virial properties of the halos with redshift and the
physics of molecular hydrogen formation at low densities. Our result implies
that the mass distribution of Population III stars inferred from their
accretion rates may be broader than previously thought, and may evolve with
redshift. Finally, we observe that our collapsing protostellar cloud cores do
not fragment, consistent with previous results, which suggests that Population
III stars which form in halos of mass 10^5 - 10^6 Msun always form in
isolation.",2006-07-02T19:06:05Z
Simulated Molecular Gas Emission in Galaxy Mergers with Embedded AGN,"We investigate the effect of embedded active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxy
mergers on the CO molecular line emission by combining non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium (LTE) radiative transfer calculations with hydrodynamic
simulations. We find that AGN feedback energy in gas rich galaxy mergers can
contribute to large molecular outflows which may be detectable via
velocity-integrated emission contour maps, as well as through kinematic
features in the emission line profiles.",2006-03-15T21:00:03Z
Hot DB White Dwarfs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,"We present ugriz photometry and optical spectroscopy for 28 DB and DO white
dwarfs with temperatures between 28,000K and 45,000K. About 10 of these are
particularly well-observed; the remainder are candidates. These are the hottest
DB stars yet found, and they populate the ""DB gap"" between the hotter DO stars
and the familiar DB stars cooler than 30,000K. Nevertheless, after carefully
matching the survey volumes, we find that the ratio of DA stars to DB/DO stars
is a factor of 2.5 larger at 30,000 K than at 20,000 K, suggesting that the ""DB
gap"" is indeed deficient and that some kind of atmospheric transformation takes
place in roughly 10% of DA stars as they cool from 30,000 K to 20,000 K.",2006-06-28T22:40:59Z
"Improving the Lagrangian perturbative solution for cosmic fluid:
  Applying Shanks transformation","We study the behavior of Lagrangian perturbative solutions. For a spherical
void model, the higher order the Lagrangian perturbation we consider, the worse
the approximation becomes in late-time evolution. In particular, if we stop to
improve until an even order is reached, the perturbative solution describes the
contraction of the void. To solve this problem, we consider improving the
perturbative solution using Shanks transformation, which accelerates the
convergence of the sequence. After the transformation, we find that the
accuracy of higher-order perturbation is recovered and the perturbative
solution is refined well. Then we show that this improvement method can apply
for a $\Lambda$CDM model and improved the power spectrum of the density field.",2006-05-10T06:38:20Z
The large-scale structure of the Universe,"Research over the past 25 years has led to the view that the rich tapestry of
present-day cosmic structure arose during the first instants of creation, where
weak ripples were imposed on the otherwise uniform and rapidly expanding
primordial soup. Over 14 billion years of evolution, these ripples have been
amplified to enormous proportions by gravitational forces, producing
ever-growing concentrations of dark matter in which ordinary gases cool,
condense and fragment to make galaxies. This process can be faithfully mimicked
in large computer simulations, and tested by a variety of observations that
probe the history of the Universe starting from just 400,000 yr after the Big
Bang.",2006-04-27T17:59:54Z
"Loki, Io: New groundbased observations and a model describing the change
  from periodic overturn","Loki Patera is the most powerful volcano in the solar system. We have
obtained measurements of Loki's 3.5 micron brightness from NASA's Infrared
Telescope Facility (IRTF) and have witnessed a change from the periodic
behavior previously noted. While Loki brightened by a factor of several every
540 days prior to 2001, from 2001 through 2004 Loki remained at a constant,
medium brightness. We have constructed a quantitative model of Loki as a
basaltic lava lake whose solidified crust overturns when it becomes buoyantly
unstable. By altering the speed at which the overturn propagates across the
patera, we can match our groundbased brightness data. In addition, we can match
other data taken at other times and wavelengths. By slowing the propagation
speed dramatically, we can match the observations from 2001-2004. This slowing
may be due to a small change in volatile content in the magma.",2006-05-09T20:02:58Z
"Ellipticity in Cosmic Microwave Background as a Tracer of Large-Scale
  Universe","Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 3-year data confirm the
ellipticity of anisotropies of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps, found
previously for Boomerang and WMAP 1-year high sensitivity maps. The low noise
level of the WMAP latter data enable also to show that, the ellipticity is a
property not described by the conventional cosmological model fitting the power
spectrum of CMB. As a large scale anomaly, the ellipticity characteristics are
consistent with the effect of geodesics mixing occurring in hyperbolic
Universe. Its relation to other large scale effects, i.e. to suppressed low
multipoles, as well as to dark energy if the latter is due to vacuum
fluctuations, is then an arising issue.",2006-07-08T08:59:20Z
"The Birth of Molecular Clouds: Formation of Atomic Precursors in
  Colliding Flows","Molecular Cloud Complexes (MCCs) are highly structured and ``turbulent''.
Observational evidence suggests that MCCs are dynamically dominated systems,
rather than quasi-equilibrium entities. The observed structure is more likely a
consequence of the formation process rather than something that is imprinted
after the formation of the MCC. Converging flows provide a natural mechanism to
generate MCC structure. We present a detailed numerical analysis of this
scenario. Our study addresses the evolution of a MCC from its birth in
colliding atomic hydrogen flows up until the point when H$_2$ may begin to
form. A combination of dynamical and thermal instabilities breaks up coherent
flows efficiently, seeding the small-scale non-linear density perturbations
necessary for local gravitational collapse and thus allowing (close to)
instantaneous star formation. Many observed properties of MCCs come as a
natural consequence of this formation scenario. Since converging flows are
omnipresent in the ISM, we discuss the general applicability of this mechanism,
from local star formation regions to galaxy mergers.",2006-05-17T20:39:22Z
Window To The Stars,"We present Window To The Stars, a graphical user interface to the popular
TWIN single/binary stellar evolution code, for novices, students and
professional astrophysicists.
  It removes the drudgery associated with the traditional approach to running
the code, while maintaining the power, output quality and flexibility a modern
stellar evolutionist requires. It is currently being used for cutting edge
research and interactive teaching.",2006-07-27T12:18:01Z
"Discovery of Very High Energy $γ$-Rays from Markarian~180 Triggered
  by an Optical Outburst","The high-frequency-peaked BL Lacertae object Markarian~180 (Mrk~180) was
observed to have an optical outburst in 2006 March, triggering a Target of
Opportunity observation with the MAGIC telescope. The source was observed for
12.4 hr and very high energy $\gamma$-ray emission was detected with a
significance of 5.5 $\sigma$. An integral flux above 200 GeV of
$(2.3\pm0.7)\times10^{-11} {cm}^{-2} {s}^{-1}$ was measured, corresponding to
11% of the Crab Nebula flux. A rather soft spectrum with a photon index of
$-3.3\pm0.7$ has been determined. No significant flux variation was found.",2006-06-26T17:03:07Z
On near Chandrasekhar mass central stars of planetary nebulae,"A recent spectroscopic analysis of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe)
claims that the sample includes five CSPNe with masses very close to the
Chandrasekhar limit of white dwarfs. This claim should be verified or discarded
from the available kinematical and chemical abundance information. Kinematical
parameters are extracted from Galactic orbits and compared with parameters
expected for populations of different ages. The chemistry of the nebulae is
compared with average values for different types. The reported high masses are
not supported by our investigation. The claimed high central star masses are in
contradiction with all other evidence. A more consistent picture emerges if
CSPN masses close to the peak of the white dwarf mass distribution are assumed.",2006-03-23T16:00:08Z
Stellar Rotation: A Clue to the Origin of High Mass Stars?,"We present the results of a study aimed at assessing whether low and high
mass stars form similarly. Our approach is (1) to examine the observed
projected rotational velocities among a large sample of newly-formed stars
spanning a range in mass between 0.2 and 50 M ; and (2) to search for evidence
of a discontinuity in rotational properties that might indicate a difference in
the stellar formation process at some characteristic mass. Our database
includes both recently published values of v sin i for young intermediate- and
low- mass stars in Orion, as well as new observations of O stars located in
young clusters and OB associations. We find that the median of the quantity
v_obs/v_c (observed rotational speed/equatorial breakup velocity) is typically
about 0.15 and shows no evidence of a discontinuity over the full range of
stellar masses, while the quantity Jsini/M (derived angular momentum per unit
mass) exhibits a slow, monotonic rise with increasing mass with no evidence of
a discontinuity. We suggest that these observations are most simply interpreted
as indicative of a single stellar formation and angular momentum regulation
mechanism: one that results in rotation rates well below breakup, and angular
momenta per unit mass that differ systematically by no more than a factor of
3-4 over a mass range spanning a factor of 250.",2006-04-25T23:49:13Z
A Method To Remove Fringes From Images Using Wavelets,"We have developed a new method that uses wavelet analysis to remove
interference fringe patterns from images. This method is particularly useful
for flat fields in the common case where fringes vary between the calibration
and object data. We analyze the efficacy of this method by creating fake flats
with fictitious fringes and removing the fringes. We find that the method
removes 90% of the fringe pattern if its amplitude is equal to the random noise
level and 60% if the fringe amplitude is $\approx 1/10$ of the noise level. We
also present examples using real flat field frames. A routine written in the
Interactive Data Language (IDL) that implements this algorithm is available
from the authors and as an attachment to this paper.",2006-05-24T01:19:42Z
Neutrino Astronomy at the South Pole,"IceCube is currently being built deep in the glacial ice beneath the South
Pole. In its second year of construction, it is already larger than its
predecessor, AMANDA. AMANDA continues to collect high energy neutrino and muon
data as an independent detector until it is integrated with IceCube. After
introducing both detectors, recent results from AMANDA and a status report on
IceCube are presented.",2006-07-01T02:35:03Z
Stability in MaVaN Models,"Mass-varying neutrino (MaVaN) models propose a source of dark energy in a new
scalar field called the acceleron. Recent work has shown that nonrelativistic
neutrino fields in these theories are unstable to inhomogeneous fluctuations,
and form structures that no longer behave as dark energy. One might expect that
in multiple-neutrino models, the lighter species could continue to act as a
source for the acceleron, generating dark energy without the help of heavier
species. This paper shows that by considering the evolution of the acceleron
field for a large class of models, the result of any neutrino component
becoming unstable is that all components become unstable within a short time on
cosmological scales. An alternate model employing a second scalar field in a
hybrid potential is shown to have stable MaVaN dark energy even in the presence
of unstable heavier components.",2006-06-01T19:09:04Z
"Average hard X-ray emission from NS LMXBs: Observational evidence of
  different spectral states in NS LMXBs","We studied and compared the long-term average hard X-ray (>20keV) spectra of
a sample of twelve bright low-mass X-ray binaries hosting a neutron star (NS).
Our sample comprises the six well studied Galactic Z sources and six Atoll
sources, four of which are bright (""GX"") bulge sources while two are weaker
ones in the 2-10keV range (H1750-440 and H1608-55). For all the sources of our
sample, we analysed available public data and extracted average spectra from
the IBIS/ISGRI detector on board INTEGRAL. We can describe all the spectral
states in terms of the bulk motion Comptonisation scenario. We find evidence
that bulk motion is always present, its strength is related to the accretion
rate and it is suppressed only in the presence of high local luminosity. The
two low-dim Atoll source spectra are dominated by photons up-scattered
presumably due to dynamical and thermal Comptonisation in an optically thin,
hot plasma. For the first time, we extend the detection of H1750-440 up to
150keV. The Z and bright ""GX"" Atoll source spectra are very similar and are
dominated by Comptonised blackbody radiation of seed photons, presumably coming
from the accretion disc and NS surface, in an optically thick cloud with plasma
temperature in the range of 2.5-3keV. Six sources show a hard tail in their
average spectrum: CygX-2 (Z), GX340+0 (Z), GX17+2 (Z), GX5-1 (Z), ScoX-1 (Z)
and GX13+1 (Atoll). This is the first detection of a hard tail in the X-ray
spectrum of the peculiar GX13+1. Using radio data from the literature we find,
in all Z sources and bright ""GX"" Atolls, a systematic positive correlation
between the X-ray hard tail (40-100keV) and the radio luminosity. This suggests
that hard tails and energetic electrons causing the radio emission may have the
same origin, most likely the Compton cloud located inside the NS magnetosphere.",2006-07-26T14:10:59Z
Distances to Anomalous X-ray Pulsars using Red Clump Stars,"We identify `red clump stars' - core helium-burning giants - among 2MASS
stars and use them to measure the run of reddening with distance in the
direction of each of the Galactic Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXP). We combine
this with extinction estimates from X-ray spectroscopy to infer distances and
find that the locations of all AXP are consistent with being in Galactic spiral
arms. We also find that the 2-10 keV luminosities implied by our distances are
remarkably similar for all AXPs, being all around 1.3e35 erg s-1. Furthermore,
using our distances to estimate effective black-body emitting radii, we find
that the radii are tightly anti-correlated with pulsed fraction, and somewhat
less tightly anti-correlated with black-body temperature. We find no obvious
relationship of any property with the dipole magnetic field strength inferred
from the spin-down rate.",2006-06-01T14:29:44Z
"Abundances of s-process elements in planetary nebulae: Br, Kr & Xe","We identify emission lines of post-iron peak elements in very high
signal-to-noise spectra of a sample of planetary nebulae. Analysis of lines
from ions of Kr and Xe reveals enhancements in most of the PNe, in agreement
with the theories of s-process in AGB star. Surprisingly, we did not detect
lines from Br even though s-process calculations indicate that it should be
produced with Kr at detectable levels.",2006-05-06T06:27:48Z
Hydrogen in Type Ic Supernovae?,"By definition, a Type Ic supernova (SN Ic) does not have conspicuous lines of
hydrogen or helium in its optical spectrum. SNe Ic usually are modelled in
terms of the gravitational collapse of bare carbon-oxygen cores. We consider
the possibility that the spectra of ordinary (SN 1994I-like) SNe Ic have been
misinterpreted, and that SNe Ic eject hydrogen. An absorption feature usually
attributed to a blend of Si II 6355 and C II 6580 may be produced by H-alpha.
If SN 1994I-like SNe Ic eject hydrogen, the possibility that hypernova (SN
1998bw-like) SNe Ic, some of which are associated with gamma-ray bursts, also
eject hydrogen should be considered. The implications of hydrogen for SN Ic
progenitors and explosion models are briefly discussed.",2006-04-03T21:28:21Z
Simulation for KM3NeT using ANTARES-Software,"The KM3NeT project is a common European effort for the design of a km3-scale

Cosmic Calibration,"The complexity and accuracy of current and future precision cosmology
observational campaigns has made it essential to develop an efficient technique
for directly combining simulation and observational datasets to determine
cosmological and model parameters; a procedure we term calibration. Once a
satisfactory calibration of the underlying cosmological model is achieved,
independent predictions for new observations become possible. For this
procedure to be effective, robust characterization of the uncertainty in the
calibration process is highly desirable. In this Letter, we describe a
statistical methodology which can achieve both of these goals. An application
example based around dark matter structure formation simulations and a
synthetic mass power spectrum dataset is used to demonstrate the approach.",2006-06-07T15:08:47Z
X-rays from Radio Millisecond Pulsars: Comptonized Thermal Radiation,"X-ray emission from many rotation-powered millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is
observed to be of predominantly thermal nature. In PSR J0437--4715, the nearest
MSP known, an additional faint power-law tail is observed above 2.5 keV,
commonly attributed to non-thermal magnetospheric radiation. We propose that
the hard emission in this and other similar MSPs is instead due to weak
Comptonization of the thermal (blackbody or hydrogen atmosphere) polar cap
emission by energetic electrons/positrons of small optical depth in the pulsar
magnetosphere. This spectral model implies that all soft X-rays are of purely
thermal origin, which has profound implications in the study of neutron star
structure and fundamental pulsar physics.",2006-05-10T20:14:58Z
Optical spectroscopy of the dwarf nova U Geminorum,"U Gem is unique in having a direct measurement of K1 = 107 +- 2 km/s, Long et
al. 1999). We present high-resolution optical spectra of the dwarf nova U Gem
in quiescence taken to test the accuracy to which the HST value can be
recovered from optical data. We find that, even with data of very high S/N we
cannot recover Long et al.'s value to better than about 20% by any method.
Contamination by neighbouring emission lines seems a likely culprit. Our data
reveal a number of new features: Doppler tomograms show emission at low
velocity, close to the centre of mass, and a transient, narrow absorption
feature is seen in the Balmer lines near the line centres at the time of
eclipse. We suggest that stellar prominences, as previously invoked for the
dwarf novae IP Peg and SS Cyg in outburst, may explain both of these features.
The He II 4686.75 A line emission is dominated by the gas stream/disc impact
region. Two distinct spots are seen in Doppler maps, the first being very
narrow and showing a velocity close to that of the accretion disc in the impact
region, and the second much broader and located between the velocities of the
(ballistic) stream and the (Keplerian) disc. We present tentative evidence of
weak spiral structure. We find no evidence of stream-disc overflow in the
system. Our data suggests an inclination angle > 70 degrees, adding to the
evidence of a puzzle in the mass of U Gem's white dwarf. The mass donor is
clearly seen in the Doppler maps, with emission concentrated towards its poles,
and mainly on the side facing the white dwarf. This suggests irradiation with
shielding by the disc from which we estimate an H/R ratio between 0.15 and
0.25.",2006-04-18T22:22:43Z
"Extending the redshift distribution of submm galaxies: Identification of
  a z~4 submm galaxy","We present the identification of a bright submillimeter galaxy (SMG) in the
field of Abell 2218. The galaxy has a spectroscopic redshift of ~4, and is
currently the highest redshift SMG known. It is detected at all wavelengths
from optical to submm, including the Spitzer IRAC bands. We discuss the
properties of this galaxy, which is undergoing intense star formation at a
rate~600 Msun/yr. We also compare the properties to those of radio-preselected
submm-bright galaxies. The z~4 result extends the redshift distribution of
SMGs.",2006-04-04T19:33:05Z
"Formation of Globular Clusters in Hierarchical Cosmology: ART and
  Science","We test the hypothesis that globular clusters form in supergiant molecular
clouds within high-redshift galaxies. Numerical simulations demonstrate that
such large, dense, and cold gas clouds assemble naturally in current
hierarchical models of galaxy formation. These clouds are enriched with heavy
elements from earlier stars and could produce star clusters in a similar way to
nearby molecular clouds. The masses and sizes of the model clusters are in
excellent agreement with the observations of young massive clusters. Do these
model clusters evolve into globular clusters that we see in our and external
galaxies? In order to study their dynamical evolution, we calculate the orbits
of model clusters using the outputs of the cosmological simulation of a Milky
Way-sized galaxy. We find that at present the orbits are isotropic in the inner
50 kpc of the Galaxy and preferentially radial at larger distances. All
clusters located outside 10 kpc from the center formed in the now-disrupted
satellite galaxies. The spatial distribution of model clusters is spheroidal,
with a power-law density profile consistent with observations. The combination
of two-body scattering, tidal shocks, and stellar evolution results in the
evolution of the cluster mass function from an initial power law to the
observed log-normal distribution. However, not all initial conditions and not
all evolution scenarios are consistent with the observed mass function.",2006-06-07T20:00:28Z
A magnetically collimated jet from the evolved star W43A,"We present the first direct measurements of the magnetic field strength and
direction in a collimated jet from an evolved star on its way to become a
planetary nebula. Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of the linear
and circular polarization of the water masers in the collimated jet of W43A
reveal a strong toroidal magnetic field, indicating that the jet is
magnetically collimated. The magnetic field strength in the jet extrapolated
back to the stellar surface yields a surface field of several Gauss, consistent
with the measurements of maser polarization in a large sample of evolved stars.
The origin of the magnetic field is yet unknown, although the jet precession
might point to the existence of a heavy planet or stellar companion. This is
the first direct observational evidence for magnetic collimation in the jets,
that likely play an important role in shaping planetary nebulae.",2006-05-03T13:58:20Z
"A strong $\ddotν - \dotν$ correlation in radio pulsars with
  implications for torque variations","We present an analysis of the spin-down parameters for 131 radio pulsars for
which $\ddot\nu$ has been well determined. These pulsars have characteristic
ages ranging from $10^{3} - 10^{8}$ yr and spin periods in the range 0.4--30 s;
nearly equal numbers of pulsars have $\ddot\nu>0$ as $\ddot\nu<0$. We find a
strong correlation of $\ddot\nu$ with $\dot{\nu}$, {\em independent of the sign
of} $\ddot\nu$. We suggest that this trend can be accounted for by small,
stochastic deviations in the spin-down torque that are directly proportional

"Goodness-of-Fit Tests DIFF1 and DIFF2 for Locally-Normalized Supernova
  Spectra","Two quantitative tests DIFF1 and DIFF2 for measuring goodness-of-fit between
two locally-normalized supernova spectra are presented. Locally-normalized
spectra are obtained by dividing a spectrum by the same spectrum smoothed over
a wavelength interval relatively large compared to line features, but
relatively small compared to continuum features. DIFF1 essentially measures the
mean relative difference between the line patterns of locally-normalized
spectra and DIFF2 is DIFF1 minimized by a relative logarithmic wavelength shift
between the spectra: the shift is effectively an artificial relative Doppler
shift. Both DIFF1 and DIFF2 measure the physical similarity of line formation,
and thus of supernovae. DIFF1 puts more weight on overall physical similarity
of the supernovae than DIFF2 because the DIFF2 shift compensates somewhat for
some physical distinction in the supernovae. Both tests are useful in ordering
supernovae into empirical groupings for further analysis. We present some
examples of locally-normalized spectra for Type IIb supernova SN 1993J with
some analysis of these spectra. The UV parts of two of the SN 1993J spectra are
HST spectra that have not been published before. We also give an example of
fitted locally-normalized spectra and, as an example of the utility of DIFF1
and DIFF2, some preliminary statistical results for hydrogen-deficient
core-collapse (HDCC) supernova spectra. This paper makes use of and refers to
material to found at the first author's online supernova spectrum database

"Colour Dependence of the Distribution of IRAS Galaxies revealed by
  Multifractal Measures","Multifractal measures are applied to three IRAS galaxy subsamples selected by
colour from the PSCz catalogue. As shown by generalised dimension spectrum, hot
IRAS galaxies are found less clustered than cold galaxies, but the difference
is very weak. An alternative tool, the conditional multifractal dimension
spectrum reveals apparent peculiarity of the distribution of hot galaxies,
especially at high orders. The conditional multifractal measure is basically
measuring the environment of selected galaxies. A detailed analysis of the
distribution of galaxies with their number of neighbours turns out that cold
galaxies are more likely living in over dense regions than hot galaxies.
Further studies suggest that, since the colour of IRAS galaxies is a good trace
of star formation rate, it is possible that we have statistical evidence here
for enhanced star formation rate due to galaxy interactions",2006-04-11T05:16:24Z
Planetary nebulae as probes for galactic chemical evolution,"The role of planetary nebulae as probes for the galactic chemical evolution
is reviewed. Their abundances throughout the Galaxy are discussed for key
elements, in particular oxygen and other alpha elements. The abundance
distribution derived from planetary nebulae leads to the establishment of
radial abundance gradients in the galactic disk that are important constraints
to model the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. The radial gradient, well
determined for the solar neighborhood, is examined for distinct regions. For
the galactic anticenter in particular, the observational data confirm results
from galactic evolution models that point to a decreasing in the gradient slope
at large galactocentric distances. The possible time evolution of the radial
gradient is also examined comparing samples of planetary nebulae of different
ages, and the results indicate that a flattening in the gradient occurred,
which is confirmed by some galactic evolution models. The galactic bulge is
another important region whose modeling can be constrained by observational
results obtained from planetary nebulae. Results derived in the last few years
indicate that bulge nebulae have an abundance distribution similar to that of
disk objects, however with a larger dispersion.",2006-04-28T19:41:39Z
"Big Bang Nucleosynthesis with Bound States of Long-lived Charged
  Particles","Charged particles (X) decaying after primordial nucleosynthesis are
constrained by the requirement that their decay products should not change the
light element abundances drastically. If the decaying particle is negatively
charged (X-) then it will bind to the nuclei. We consider the effects of the
decay of X when bound to Helium-4 and show that this will modify the Lithium
abundances.",2006-06-08T20:01:09Z
The halo mass function from the dark ages through the present day,"We use an array of high-resolution N-body simulations to determine the mass
function of dark matter haloes at redshifts 10-30. We develop a new method for
compensating for the effects of finite simulation volume that allows us to find
an approximation to the true ``global'' mass function. By simulating a wide
range of volumes at different mass resolution, we calculate the abundance of
haloes of mass 10^{5-12} Msun/h. This enables us to predict accurately the
abundance of the haloes that host the sources that reionize the universe. In
particular, we focus on the small mass haloes (>~10^{5.5-6} Msun/h) likely to
harbour population III stars where gas cools by molecular hydrogen emission,
early galaxies in which baryons cool by atomic hydrogen emission at a virial
temperature of ~10^4K (10^{7.5-8} Msun/h), and massive galaxies that may be
observable at redshift ~10. When we combine our data with simulations that
include high mass halos at low redshift, we find that the best fit to the halo
mass function depends not only on linear overdensity, as is commonly assumed in
analytic models, but also upon the slope of the linear power spectrum at the
scale of the halo mass. The Press-Schechter model gives a poor fit to the halo
mass function in the simulations at all epochs; the Sheth-Tormen model gives a
better match, but still overpredicts the abundance of rare objects at all times
by up to 50%. Finally, we consider the consequences of the recently released
WMAP 3-year cosmological parameters. These lead to much less structure at high
redshift, reducing the number of z=10 ``mini-haloes'' by more than a factor of
two and the number of z=30 galaxy hosts by more than four orders of magnitude.

"Parametric modelling of the 3.6um to 8um colour distributions of
  galaxies in the SWIRE Survey","We fit a parametric model comprising a mixture of multi-dimensional Gaussian
functions to the 3.6 to 8um colour and optical photo-z distribution of galaxy
populations in the ELAIS-N1 and Lockman Fields of SWIRE. For 16,698 sources in
ELAIS-N1 we find our data are best modelled (in the sense of the Bayesian
Information Criterion) by the sum of four Gaussian distributions or modes (C_a,
C_b, C_c and C_d). We compare the fit of our empirical model with predictions
from existing semi-analytic and phenomological models. We infer that our
empirical model provides a better description of the mid-infrared colour
distribution of the SWIRE survey than these existing models. This colour
distribution test is thus a powerful model discriminator and complementary to
comparisons of number counts. We use our model to provide a galaxy
classification scheme and explore the nature of the galaxies in the different
modes of the model. C_a consists of dusty star-forming systems such as ULIRG's.
Low redshift late-type spirals are found in C_b, where PAH emission dominates
at 8um. C_c consists of dusty starburst systems at intermediate redshifts. Low
redshift early-type spirals and ellipticals dominate C_d. We thus find a
greater variety of galaxy types than one can with optical photometry alone.
Finally we develop a new technique to identify unusual objects, and find a
selection of outliers with very red IRAC colours. These objects are not
detected in the optical, but have very strong detections in the mid-infrared.
These sources are modelled as dust-enshrouded, strongly obscured AGN, where the
high mid-infrared emission may either be attributed to dust heated by the AGN
or substantial star-formation. These sources have z_ph ~ 2-4, making them
incredibly infrared luminous, with a L_IR ~ 10^(12.6-14.1) L_sun.",2006-04-20T14:16:51Z
Probing dark energy with the shear-ratio geometric test,"We adapt the Jain--Taylor (2003) shear-ratio geometric lensing method to
measure the dark energy equation of state, and its time derivative from dark
matter haloes in cosmologies with arbitrary spatial curvature. The full
shear-ratio covariance matrix is calculated for lensed sources, including the
intervening large-scale structure and photometric redshift errors as additional
sources of noise, and a maximum likelihood method for applying the test is
presented. Combining with the expected results from the CMB we design an
optimal survey for probing dark energy. A targeted survey imaging 60 of the
largest clusters in a hemisphere with 5-band optical photometric redshifts to a
median galaxy depth of zm=0.9 could measure w0 to a marginal 1-sigma error of
$\Delta$w0=0.5. We marginalize over all other parameters including wa, where
the equation of state is parameterized in terms of scale factor a as
w(a)=w0+wa(1-a). For higher accuracy a large-scale photometric redshift survey
is required. Such a near-future 5-band survey covering 10,000 square degrees to
z_m=0.7 could measure w0 to $\Delta$w0=0.075 and $\Delta$wa=0.33. A stronger
combined constraint is measured at a pivot redshift zp=0.27 of
$\Delta$w(zp)=0.0298. We compare and combine the geometric test with the
cosmological and dark energy parameters measured from planned Baryon Acoustic
Oscillation (BAO) and supernova Type Ia experiments, and find that the
geometric test results combine with a significant reduction in errors due to
different degeneracies. A combination of geometric lensing, CMB and BAO
experiments could achieve a pivot redshift constraint of $\Delta$w(zp)=0.020 at
zp=0.62. Simple relations are presented that show how our lensing results can
be scaled to other telescope classes and survey parameters.",2006-06-17T12:34:17Z
"Breaking the scale invariance of the primordial spectrum or not: the new
  WMAP data","It seems that new WMAP data requires a fit with a primordial spectrum
containig small negative tilt index in addition to the featureless
Harrison-Zeldovich- Peebles spectrum thus implying a broken scale invariance.
We show that the data could be otherwise interpreted by a scale invariant
primordial spectrum with the scale non-invariant evolution of density contrast
using the Press-Schechter formalism. The estimate of the acceleration
parameter, as a source of the inhomogeneity of spacetime, is made by searching
for the minima of the deviation measure defined by the Press-Schechter mass
functions for this interpretation compared to the assumptions implicit in the
WMAP fit.",2006-04-13T16:57:14Z
"A search for kilogauss magnetic fields in white dwarfs and hot subdwarf
  stars","We present new results of a survey for weak magnetic fields among DA white
dwarfs with inclusion of some brighter hot subdwarf stars. We have detected
variable circular polarization in the Halpha line of the hot subdwarf star
Feige 34 (SP: sdO). From these data, we estimate that the longitudinal magnetic
field of this star varies from -1.1 +/- 3.2 kG to +9.6 +/- 2.6 kG, with a mean
of about +5 kG and a period longer than 2 h. In this study, we also confirm the
magnetic nature of white dwarf WD1105-048 and present upper limits of kilogauss
longitudinal magnetic fields of 5 brightest DA white dwarfs. Our data support
recent finding that 25% of white dwarfs have kilogauss magnetic fields. This
frequency also confirms results of early estimates obtained using the magnetic
field function of white dwarfs.",2006-05-16T21:33:37Z
"Yields of Population III Supernovae and the Abundance Patterns of
  Extremely Metal-Poor Stars","The abundance patterns of extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars provide us with
important information on nucleosynthesis in supernovae (SNe) formed in a Pop
III or EMP environment, and thus on the nature of the first stars in the
Universe. We review nucleosynthesis yields of various types of those SNe,
focusing on core-collapse (black-hole-forming) SNe with various progenitor
masses, explosion energies (including Hypernovae), and asphericity. We discuss
the implications of the observed trends in the abundance ratios among iron-peak
elements, and the large C/Fe ratio observed in certain EMP stars with
particular attention to recently discovered hyper metal-poor (HMP) stars. We
show that the abundance pattern of the HMP stars with [Fe/H] < -5 and other EMP
stars are in good accord with those of black-hole-forming supernovae, but not
pair-instability supernovae. This suggests that black-hole-forming supernovae
made important contributions to the early Galactic (and cosmic) chemical
evolution. Finally we discuss the nature of First (Pop III) Stars.",2006-03-16T18:09:36Z
Search for Lambda-Doubling Transitions of SiH in Orion KL,"A recent submillimeter line survey of Orion KL claimed detection of SiH. This
paper reports on GBT observations of the 5.7 GHz Lambda-doubling transitions of
SiH in Orion. Many recombination lines, including C164-delta, are seen, but SiH
is not detected. The nondetection corresponds to an upper limit of 1.5 x 10^15
cm^-2 (4 sigma) for the beam-averaged column density of SiH. This suggests that
the fractional abundance of SiH in the extended ridge is no more than twice
that in the hot core.",2006-06-20T20:44:49Z
The effect of giant molecular clouds on star clusters,"We study the encounters between stars clusters and giant molecular clouds
(GMCs). The effect of these encounters has previously been studied analytically
for two cases: 1) head-on encounters, for which the cluster moves through the
centre of the GMC and 2) distant encounters, where the encounter distance p >
3*R_n, with p the encounter parameter and R_n the radius of the GMC. We
introduce an expression for the energy gain of the cluster due to GMC
encounters valid for all values of p and R_n. This analytical result is
confronted with results from N-body simulations and excellent agreement is
found. From the simulations we find that the fractional mass loss is only 25%
of the fractional energy gain. This is because stars escape with velocities
much higher than the escape velocity. Based on the mass loss, we derive a
disruption time for star clusters due to encounters with GMCs of the form t_dis
[Gyr] = 2.0*S*(M_c/10^4 M_sun)^gamma, with S=1 for the solar neighbourhood and
inversely proportional with the global GMC density and gamma=1-3lambda, with
lambda the index that relates the cluster half-mass radius to the cluster mass
(r_h ~ M_c^lambda). The observed shallow relation between cluster radius and
mass (e.g. lambda=0.1), makes the index (gamma=0.7) similar to the index found
both from observations and from simulations of clusters dissolving in tidal
fields (gamma=0.62). The constant of 2.0 Gyr, which is the disruption time of a
10^4 M_sun cluster in the solar neighbourhood, is close to the value of 1.3 Gyr
which was empirically determined from the age distribution of open clusters.
This suggests that the combined effect of GMC encounters, stellar evolution and
galactic tidal field can explain the lack of old open clusters in the solar
neighbourhood.",2006-05-01T10:02:35Z
"Non linear particle acceleration at non-relativistic shock waves in the
  presence of self-generated turbulence","Particle acceleration at astrophysical shocks may be very efficient if
magnetic scattering is self-generated by the same particles. This nonlinear
process adds to the nonlinear modification of the shock due to the dynamical
reaction of the accelerated particles on the shock. Building on a previous
general solution of the problem of particle acceleration with arbitrary
diffusion coefficients (Amato & Blasi, 2005), we present here the first
semi-analytical calculation of particle acceleration with both effects taken
into account at the same time: charged particles are accelerated in the
background of Alfven waves that they generate due to the streaming instability,
and modify the dynamics of the plasma in the shock vicinity.",2006-06-23T16:08:55Z
"Weak Lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Background by Foreground
  Gravitational Waves","Weak lensing distortion of the background cosmic microwave background (CMB)
temperature and polarization patterns by the foreground density fluctuations is
well studied in the literature. We discuss the gravitational lensing
modification to CMB anisotropies and polarization by a stochastic background of
primordial gravitational waves between us and the last scattering surface.
While density fluctuations perturb CMB photons via gradient-type deflections
only, foreground gravitational waves distort CMB anisotropies via both
gradient- and curl-type displacements. The latter is a rotation of background
images, while the former is related to the lensing convergence. For a
primordial background of inflationary gravitational waves, with an amplitude
corresponding to a tensor-to-scalar ratio below the current upper limit of
$\sim$ 0.3, the resulting modifications to the angular power spectra of CMB
temperature anisotropy and polarization are below the cosmic variance limit. At
tens of arcminute angular scales and below, these corrections, however, are
above the level at which systematics must be controlled in all-sky anisotropy
and polarization maps with no instrumental noise and other secondary and
foreground signals.",2006-04-07T21:07:56Z
Water masers in the Local Group of galaxies,"We compare the number of detected 22 GHz H2O masers in the Local Group
galaxies M31, M33, NGC6822, IC10, IC1613, DDO187, GR8, NGC185, and the
Magellanic Clouds with the water maser population of the Milky Way. To
accomplish this we searched for water maser emission in the two Local Group
galaxies M33 and NGC6822 using the Very Large Array (VLA) and incorporated
results from previous studies. We observed 62 HII regions in M33 and 36 regions
with H-alpha emission in NGC6822. Detection limits are 0.0015 and 0.0008 Lsun
for M33 and NGC6822, respectively (corresponding to 47 and 50 mJy in three
channels with 0.7 km/s width). M33 hosts three water masers above our detection
limit, while in NGC6822 no maser source was detected. We find that the water
maser detection rates in the Local Group galaxies M31, M33, NGC6822, IC1613,
DDO187, GR8, NGC185, and the Magellanic Clouds are consistent with expectations
from the Galactic water masers if one considers the different star formation
rates of the galaxies. However, the galaxy IC10 exhibits an overabundance of
masers, which may result from a compact central starburst.",2006-06-22T13:32:19Z
"New light on the old problem of lithium pre--MS depletion: models with
  2D RHD convection","The Teff location of Pre-Main Sequence (PMS) evolutionary tracks depends on
the treatment of over-adiabaticity. We present here the PMS evolutionary tracks
computed by using the mixing length theory of convection (MLT) in which the
alpha_MLT=l/H_p parameter calibration is based on 2D--hydrodynamical models
(Ludwig et al. 1999). These MLT--\alpha^2D stellar models and tracks are very
similar to those computed with non--grey ATLAS9 atmospheric boundary conditions
and Full Spectrum of Turbulence (FST) convection model both in the atmosphere
and in the interior. The comparison of the new tracks with the location on the
HR diagram of pre--MS binariesis not completely satisfactory, as some binary
components are located at too low \teff. Besides, the pre--MS lithium depletion
in the MLT--\alpha^2D tracks is still much larger than that expected from the
observations of lithium in young open clusters. This result is similar to that
of FST models. Thus, in spite of the fact that 2D RHD models should provide a
better convection description than any local model, their introduction is not
sufficient to reconcile theory and observations. Lithium depletion in young
clusters points towards a convection efficiency which, in pre--MS, should be
smaller than in the MS. The pre--MS lithium depletion decreases significantly
in FST models if we reduce the solar metallicity down to the value suggested by
Asplund et al.(2004), but the corresponding solar model does not reproduce the
depth of the convective zone as determined by helioseismology.",2006-05-24T09:17:10Z
"Polarisation measurements with a CdTe pixel array detector for Laue hard
  X-ray focusing telescopes","Polarimetry is an area of high energy astrophysics which is still relatively
unexplored, even though it is recognized that this type of measurement could
drastically increase our knowledge of the physics and geometry of high energy
sources. For this reason, in the context of the design of a Gamma-Ray Imager
based on new hard-X and soft gamma ray focusing optics for the next ESA Cosmic
Vision call for proposals (Cosmic Vision 2015-2025), it is important that this
capability should be implemented in the principal on-board instrumentation. For
the particular case of wide band-pass Laue optics we propose a focal plane
based on a thick pixelated CdTe detector operating with high efficiency between
60-600 keV. The high segmentation of this type of detector (1-2 mm pixel size)
and the good energy resolution (a few keV FWHM at 500 keV) will allow high
sensitivity polarisation measurements (a few % for a 10 mCrab source in 106s)
to be performed. We have evaluated the modulation Q factors and minimum
detectable polarisation through the use of Monte Carlo simulations (based on
the GEANT 4 toolkit) for on and off-axis sources with power law emission
spectra using the point spread function of a Laue lens in a feasible
configuration.",2006-05-25T16:26:03Z
Photometric Variability of Be/X-ray-Pulsar Binaries in the SMC,"We have studied the photometric variability of ten SMC Be/X-ray pulsars using
MACHO and OGLE-II data. For some of these systems we have found periodic
behavior, including orbital outbursts and/or nonradial pulsations (NRP) of the
Be star. For others we were unable to identify any clear photometric
periodicity, although their longterm light curves show significant structure.
We present periodograms, phase dispersion minimization (PDM) variances, and
folded light curves for the systems which exhibit periodic photometric
variability.",2006-05-16T19:49:28Z
"The importance of interloper removal in galaxy clusters: saving more
  objects for the Jeans analysis","We study the effect of contamination by interlopers in kinematic samples of
galaxy clusters. We demonstrate that without the proper removal of interlopers
the inferred parameters of the mass distribution in the cluster are strongly
biased towards higher mass and lower concentration. The interlopers are removed
using two procedures previously shown to work most efficiently on simulated
data. One is based on using the virial mass estimator and calculating the
maximum velocity available to cluster members and the other relies on the ratio
of the virial and projected mass estimators. We illustrate the performance of
the methods in detail using the example of A576, a cluster with a strong
uniform background contamination, and compare the case of A576 to 15 other
clusters with different degree of contamination. We model the velocity
dispersion and kurtosis profiles obtained for the cleaned data samples of these
clusters solving the Jeans equations to estimate the mass, concentration and
anisotropy parameter. We present the mass-concentration relation for the total
sample of 22 clusters.",2006-06-26T08:02:15Z
High eccentricity planets from the Anglo-Australian Planet Search,"We report Doppler measurements of the stars HD187085 and HD20782 which
indicate two high eccentricity low-mass companions to the stars. We find
HD187085 has a Jupiter-mass companion with a ~1000d orbit. Our formal `best
fit' solution suggests an eccentricity of 0.47, however, it does not sample the
periastron passage of the companion and we find that orbital solutions with
eccentricities between 0.1 and 0.8 give only slightly poorer fits (based on RMS
and chi^2) and are thus plausible. Observations made during periastron passage
in 2007 June should allow for the reliable determination of the orbital
eccentricity for the companion to HD187085. Our dataset for HD20782 does sample
periastron and so the orbit for its companion can be more reliably determined.
We find the companion to HD20782 has M sin i=1.77+/-0.22M_JUP, an orbital
period of 595.86+/-0.03d and an orbit with an eccentricity of 0.92+/-0.03. The
detection of such high-eccentricity (and relatively low velocity amplitude)
exoplanets appears to be facilitated by the long-term precision of the
Anglo-Australian Planet Search. Looking at exoplanet detections as a whole, we
find that those with higher eccentricity seem to have relatively higher
velocity amplitudes indicating higher mass planets and/or an observational bias
against the detection of high eccentricity systems.",2006-03-14T02:13:30Z
New Praesepe white dwarfs and the initial mass-final mass relation,"We report the spectroscopic confirmation of four further white dwarf members
of Praesepe. This brings the total number of confirmed white dwarf members to
eleven making this the second largest collection of these objects in an open
cluster identified to date. This number is consistent with the high mass end of
the initial mass function of Praesepe being Salpeter in form. Furthermore, it
suggests that the bulk of Praesepe white dwarfs did not gain a substantial
recoil kick velocity from possible asymmetries in their loss of mass during the
asymptotic giant branch phase of evolution. By comparing our estimates of the
effective temperatures and the surface gravities of WD0833+194, WD0840+190,
WD0840+205 and WD0843+184 to modern theoretical evolutionary tracks we have
derived their masses to be in the range 0.72-0.76Msun and their cooling ages
\~300Myrs. For an assumed cluster age of 625+/-50Myrs the infered progenitor
masses are between 3.3-3.5Msun. Examining these new data in the context of the
initial mass-final mass relation we find that it can be adequately represented
by a linear function (a0=0.289+/-0.051, a1=0.133+/-0.015) over the initial mass
range 2.7Msun to 6Msun. Assuming an extrapolation of this relation to larger
initial masses is valid and adopting a maximum white dwarf mass of 1.3Msun, our
results support a minimum mass for core-collapse supernovae progenitors in the
range ~6.8-8.6Msun.",2006-03-13T18:08:39Z
Carbon stars in local group dwarf galaxies: C and O abundances,"We present abundances of carbon and oxygen as well as abundance ratios
12C/13C for a sample of carbon stars in the LMC, SMC, Carina, Sculptor and
Fornax dwarf galaxies. The overall metallicities in these dwarf galaxies are
lower than in the galactic disc. The observations cover most of the AGB and we
discuss the abundance patterns in different regions along the AGB. The
abundances are determined from infrared spectra obtained with the ISAAC
spectrometer on VLT (R=1500) and the Phoenix Spectrometer on Gemini South
(R=50000). The synthetic spectra used in the analysis were computed with MARCS
model atmospheres. We find that the oxygen abundance is decreasing with
decreasing overall metallicity of the system while the C/O ratio at a given
evolutionary phase is increasing with decreasing oxygen abundance. keywords

occasional initial data. This fact allows us to apply the theory of irreducible
unitary representations of the Poincare group in order to describe the Universe

Geometrical Distance Determination using Type I X-ray Bursts,"With the excellent angular resolution of the Chandra X-ray Observatory, it is
possible to geometrically determine the distance to variable Galactic sources,
based on the phenomenon that scattered radiation appearing in the X-ray halo
has to travel along a slightly longer path than the direct, unscattered
radiation. By measuring the delayed variability, constraints on the source
distance can be obtained if the halo brightness is large enough to dominate the
point spread function (PSF) and to provide sufficient statistics. The distance
to Cyg X-3, which has a quasi-sinusoidal light curve, has been obtained with
this approach by Predehl et al. Here we examine the feasibility of using the
delayed signature of type I X-ray bursts as distance indicators. We use
simulations of delayed X-ray burst light curves in the halo to find that the
optimal annular region and energy band for a distance measurement with a
grating observation is roughly 10-50"" and 1-5 keV respectively, assuming
Chandra's effective area and PSF, uniformly distributed dust, the input
spectrum and optical depth to GX 13+1, and the Weingartner & Draine
interstellar grain model. We find that the statistics are dominated by Poisson
noise rather than systematic uncertainties, e.g., the PSF contribution to the
halo. Using Chandra, a distance measurement to such a source at 4 (8) kpc could
be made to about 23% (30%) accuracy with a single burst with 68% confidence. By
stacking many bursts, a reasonable estimate of systematic errors limit the
distance measurement to about 10% accuracy.",2006-06-26T21:26:19Z
"Electron-ion recombination measurements motivated by AGN X-ray
  absorption features: Fe XIV forming Fe XIII","Recent spectroscopic models of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have indicated
that the recommended electron-ion recombination rate coefficients for iron ions
with partially filled M-shells are incorrect in the temperature range where
these ions form in photoionized plasmas. We have investigated this
experimentally for Fe XIV forming Fe XIII. The recombination rate coefficient
was measured employing the electron-ion merged beams method at the Heidelberg
heavy-ion storage-ring TSR. The measured energy range of 0-260 eV encompassed
all dielectronic recombination (DR) 1s2 2s2 2p6 3l 3l' 3l'' nl''' resonances
associated with the 3p1/2 -> 3p3/2, 3s -> 3p, 3p -> 3d and 3s -> 3d core

This range also includes the 1s2 2s2 2p6 3l 3l' 4l'' nl''' resonances
associated with 3s -> 4l'' and 3p -> 4l'' core excitations. We find that in the
temperature range 2--14 eV, where Fe XIV is expected to form in a photoionized

"Prospects for Lunar Satellite Detection of Radio Pulses from Ultrahigh
  Energy Neutrinos Interacting with the Moon","The Moon provides a huge effective detector volume for ultrahigh energy
cosmic neutrinos, which generate coherent radio pulses in the lunar surface
layer due to the Askaryan effect. In light of presently considered lunar
missions, we propose radio measurements from a Moon-orbiting satellite. First
systematic Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the detectability of Askaryan
pulses from neutrinos with energies above 10^{20} eV, i.e. near and above the
interesting GZK limit, at the very low fluxes predicted in different scenarios.",2006-04-10T17:20:57Z
Oscillations in the stable starless core Barnard 68,"New molecular line observations of the Bok globule Barnard 68 in HCO+
irrefutably confirm the complex pattern of red and blue asymmetric line
profiles seen across the face of the cloud in previous observations of CS. The
new observations thus strengthen the previous interpretation that Barnard 68 is
undergoing peculiar oscillations. Furthermore, the physical chemistry of B68
indicates that the object is much older than the sound crossing time and is
therefore long-lived. A model is presented for the globule in which a modest
external pressure perturbation is shown to lead to oscillations about a stable
equilibrium configuration. Such oscillations may be present in other stable
starless cores as manifested by a similar signature of inward and outward
motions.",2006-04-04T14:17:30Z
Internal kinematics of modelled interacting disc galaxies,"We present an investigation of galaxy-galaxy interactions and their effects
on the velocity fields of disc galaxies in combined N-body/hydrodynamic
simulations, which include cooling, star formation with feedback, and galactic
winds. Rotation curves (RCs) of the gas are extracted from these simulations in
a way that follows the procedure applied to observations of distant, small, and
faint galaxies as closely as possible. We show that galaxy-galaxy mergers and
fly-bys disturb the velocity fields significantly and hence the RCs of the
interacting galaxies, leading to asymmetries and distortions in the RCs.
Typical features of disturbed kinematics are significantly rising or falling
profiles in the direction of the companion galaxy and pronounced bumps in the
RCs. In addition, tidal tails can leave strong imprints on the rotation curve.
All these features are observable for intermediate redshift galaxies, on which
we focus our investigations. We use a quantitative measure for the asymmetry of
rotation curves to show that the appearance of these distortions strongly
depends on the viewing angle. We also find in this way that the velocity fields
settle back into relatively undisturbed equilibrium states after unequal mass
mergers and fly-bys. About 1 Gyr after the first encounter, the RCs show no
severe distortions anymore. These results are consistent with previous
theoretical and observational studies. As an illustration of our results, we
compare our simulated velocity fields and direct images with rotation curves
from VLT/FORS spectroscopy and ACS images of a cluster at z=0.53 and find
remarkable similarities.",2006-03-30T16:20:02Z
"Detection of Diffuse Interstellar Bands in the z=0.5 Damped Lyman alpha
  system towards AO 0235+164","We report the first detection of the 5705 and 5780 A Diffuse Interstellar
Bands (DIBs) in a moderate redshift Damped Lyman alpha (DLA) system. We measure
a rest frame equivalent width of 63.2 +- 8.7 mA for the 5705 and 216+-9 mA for
the 5780 A feature in the z_abs 0.524 DLA towards AO 0235+164 and derive limits
for the equivalent widths of the bands at 5797, 6284, and 6613 A. The
equivalent width of the 5780 band is lower than would be expected based on the
Galactic correlation of DIB strength with N(HI), but is in good agreement with
the correlation with E(B-V). The relative strengths of the 5780 and 6284 A DIBs
are inconsistent with all Galactic and extragalactic sightlines, except one
Small Magellanic Cloud wing sightline towards Sk 143. However, the relative
strengths of the 5705 and 5780 A DIBs are consistent with the Galactic
relation, indicating that the relative strengths of these bands may be less
sensitive to environment or that they may be associated with a similar carrier.
The detection of DIBs at z~0.5 demonstrates that the organic compounds usually
assumed to be the band carriers were already present in the universe some five
gigayears ago.",2006-05-18T20:36:36Z
"Modelling the Pan-Spectral Energy Distribution of Starburst Galaxies:
  II. Control of the \HII Region Parameters","We examine, from a theoretical viewpoint, how the physical parameters of HII
regions are controlled in both normal galaxies and in starburst environments.
These parameters are the HII region luminosity function, the time-dependent
size, the covering fraction of molecular clouds, the pressure in the ionized
gas and the ionization parameter. The factors which control them are the
initial mass function of the exciting stars, the cluster mass function, the
metallicity and the mean pressure in the surrounding interstellar medium. We
investigate the sensitivity of the H$\alpha$ luminosity to the IMF, and find
that this can translate to more than a factor two variation in derived star
formation rates. The molecular cloud dissipation timescale is estimated from a
case study of M17 to be $\sim1$ Myr for this object. Based upon HII luminosity
function fitting for nearby galaxies, we suggest that the \HII region cluster
mass function is fitted by a log-normal form peaking at $\sim 100 M_{\odot}$.
The cluster mass function continues the stellar IMF to higher mass. The
pressure in the HII regions is controlled by the mechanical luminosity flux
from the central cluster. Since this is closely related to the ionizing photon
flux, we show that the ionization parameter is not a free variable, and that
the diffuse ionized medium may be composed of many large, faint and old HII
regions. Finally, we derive theoretical probability distributions for the
ionization parameter as a function of metallicity and compare these to those
derived for SDSS galaxies.",2006-06-22T02:16:24Z
U solubility in the core of Earth,"Uranium is the most important heat producing element in the Earth. The
presence of an appreciable amount of U in the core of Earth would have an
important influence on geodynamics. In this study, the solubility of U in
Fe-10wt% S and in Fe-35wt% S was measured by partitioning experiments with a
mixture of peridotite, uraninite, Fe and FeS powder at pressure (P) of 0-9 GPa
and temperature (T) of 1500-2200 oC. Comparisons with the run products
containing pure Fe as the metal phase in our previous study and re-analysis of
run products were made in this study. We found that in all run products,
including Fe-10wt% S, Fe-35wt% S and pure Fe groups, the solubility and
partitioning of U in the pure metal or metal-sulfide phase relative to the
silicate phase (DU) increases with increasing P and T. With a molten silicate
phase, DU is generally 3-6 times larger than with a solid silicate phase. While
DU has a positive dependence on S concentration of the metal-sulfide phase,
there is a negative correlation between Ca and U. According to our calculations
based on these experimental results, if the core has formed from a magma ocean
at a P of 26 GPa at its base and the core contained 10wt% S, then it could have
incorporated at least 10 ppb U. Alternatively, if the core formed by
percolation and contained 10wt% S, then it could have incorporated 5-22 ppb U.
The geophysical implications of U in the core of Earth are discussed.",2006-06-26T19:46:24Z
Radial Velocity Studies of Southern Close Binary Stars.I,"Radial-velocity measurements and sine-curve fits to the orbital velocity

"VLT/UVES Spectroscopy of Individual Stars in Three Globular Clusters in
  the Fornax Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy","We present a high resolution (R ~ 43000) abundance analysis of a total of
nine stars in three of the five globular clusters associated with the nearby
Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. These three clusters (1, 2 and 3) trace the
oldest, most metal-poor stellar populations in Fornax. We determine abundances
of O, Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Zn, Y, Ba, La, Nd and Eu in most of these
stars, and for some stars also Mn and La. We demonstrate that classical
indirect methods (isochrone fitting and integrated spectra) of metallicity
determination lead to values of [Fe/H] which are 0.3 to 0.5 dex too high, and
that this is primarily due to the underlying reference calibration typically
used by these studies. We show that Cluster 1, with [Fe /H] = -2.5, now holds
the record for the lowest metallicity globular cluster. We also measure an
over-abundance of Eu in Cluster 3 stars that has only been previously detected
in a subgroup of stars in M15. We find that the Fornax globular cluster
properties are a global match to what is found in their Galactic counterparts;
including deep mixing abundance patterns in two stars. We conclude that at the
epoch of formation of globular clusters both the Milky Way and the Fornax dwarf
spheroidal galaxy shared the same initial conditions, presumably pre-enriched
by the same processes, with identical nucleosynthesis patterns.",2006-03-13T19:08:24Z
Constraining the environment of GRB 990712 through emission line fluxes,"The energy output in the gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission and afterglow
phase is expected to photoionize the surrounding medium out to large radii.
Cooling of this gas produces line emission, particularly strong in the optical,
whose variability is a strong diagnostics of the gas density and geometry in
the close environment of the burst. We present the results of a spectral time
series analysis of the host galaxy of GRB 990712 observed up to ~6 years after
the burst. We analyze the emission line fluxes together with those of the
previous observations of the same GRB, in search for photoionization
signatures. We find that the emission line fluxes show no variation within the
uncertainities up to 6 years after the burst, and we use the measured line
intensities to set a limit on the density of the gas within a few parsecs of
the burst location. This is the first time that emission from cooling GRB
remnants is probed on years time scales.",2006-07-10T16:04:17Z
"Core Structure of Intracluster Gas: Effects of Radiative Cooling on Core
  Sizes","We investigate the core structure of radiatively cooling intracluster gas,
using a hydrodynamics code. We calculate evolution of model clusters of the
initial core radii 160--300 kpc until the initial central cooling time, and
analyze the resultant clusters using the double beta-model as done by
observational studies. It is found that the core-size distribution thus
obtained shows two peaks \sim 30--100 kpc and \sim 100--300 kpc and marginally
can reproduce the observed distribution which exhibits two distinct peaks
around \sim 50 kpc and \sim 200 kpc. This result may suggest radiative-cooling
origin for small cores, while cooling is yet insignificant in the clusters of
large cores. It should be noted that the small core peak is reproduced by
clusters that are still keeping quasi-hydrostatic balance before the initial
central cooling time has elapsed.",2006-04-10T11:26:31Z
An Extremely Curved Relativistic Jet in PKS 2136+141,"We report the discovery of an extremely curved jet in the radio-loud quasar
PKS2136+141. Multi-frequency Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) images show a
bending jet making a turn-around of 210 degrees in the plane of the sky, which
is, to our knowledge, the largest ever observed change in the position angle of
an astrophysical jet. Images taken at six different frequencies, from 2.3 to 43
GHz, reveal a spiral-like trajectory, which is likely a sign of an intrinsic
helical geometry. A space-VLBI image, taken with the HALCA satellite at 5 GHz
and having comparable resolution to our ground-based 15 GHz data, confirms that
the bend is a frequency-independent structure. VLBA monitoring data at 15 GHz,
covering eight years of observations, show knots in the jet clearly deviating
from ballistic motion, which suggests that the bending may be caused by a
growing helical Kelvin-Helmholtz normal mode. The jet appearance suggests a
helical wave at a frequency well below the ""resonant"" frequency of the jet,
which indicates that the wave is driven by a periodic perturbation at the base
of the jet. We fit the observed structure in the source with a helical twist,
and we find that a simple isothermal model with a constant wave speed and
wavelength gives a good fit. The measured apparent velocities indicate some
degree of acceleration along the jet, which together with an observed change in
the apparent half-opening angle of the jet allow us to estimate the changes in
the angle between the local jet direction and our line of sight. We suggest
that the jet in PKS2136+141 is distorted by a helical Kelvin-Helmholtz normal
mode externally driven into the jet (e.g. by precession), and that our line of
sight falls within the opening angle of the helix cone.",2006-05-04T19:55:43Z
"Swift observations of the 2006 outburst of the recurrent nova RS
  Ophiuchi: I. Early X-ray emission from the shocked ejecta and red giant wind","RS Ophiuchi began its latest outburst on 2006 February 12. Previous outbursts
have indicated that high velocity ejecta interact with a pre-existing red giant
wind, setting up shock systems analogous to those seen in Supernova Remnants.
However, in the previous outburst in 1985, X-ray observations did not commence
until 55 days after the initial explosion. Here we report on Swift observations
covering the first month of the 2006 outburst with the Burst Alert (BAT) and
X-ray Telescope (XRT) instruments. RS Oph was clearly detected in the BAT 14-25
keV band from t=0 to $t\sim6$ days. XRT observationsfrom 0.3-10 keV, started at
3.17 days after outburst. The rapidly evolving XRT spectra clearly show the
presence of both line and continuum emission which can be fitted by thermal
emission from hot gas whose characteristic temperature, overlying absorbing
column, $[N_H]_W$, and resulting unabsorbed total flux decline monotonically
after the first few days. Derived shock velocities are in good agreement with
those found from observations at other wavelengths. Similarly, $[N_H]_W$ is in
accord with that expected from the red giant wind ahead of the forward shock.
We confirm the basic models of the 1985 outburst and conclude that standard
Phase I remnant evolution terminated by $t\sim10$ days and the remnant then
rapidly evolved to display behaviour characteristic of Phase III. Around t=26
days however, a new, luminous and highly variable soft X-ray source began to
appear whose origin will be explored in a subsequent paper.",2006-04-28T18:40:45Z
A FIRST-APM-SDSS survey for high-redshift radio QSOs,"We selected from VLA-FIRST a sample of 94 objects starlike in SDSSS, and with
APM colour O-E>2, i.e. consistent with their being high-z QSOs. 78 candidates
were classified spectroscopically from published data (mainly SDSS) or
observations reported here. The fractions of QSOs (51/78) and z > 3 QSOs
(23/78) are comparable to those found in other photometric searches for high-z
QSOs. We confirm that O-E>2 ensures inclusion of all QSOs with 3.7 < z < 4.4.
The fraction of broad absorption line (BAL) QSOs for 2 < z < 4.4 is 27+-10 per
cent (7/26), and the estimated BAL fraction for radio loud (RL) QSOs is at
least as high as for optically selected QSOs (about 13 per cent). The high BAL
fraction and the high fraction of LoBALs in our sample are likely due to the
red colour selection. The space density of RL QSOs for 3.7 < z < 4.4, MAB (1450
A) < -26.6 and P(1.4 GHz) > 10^25.7 W Hz^(-1) is 1.7+-0.6 Gpc^(-3). Adopting a
RL fraction 13.4+-3 per cent, this corresponds to rho = 12.5+-5.6 Gpc^(-3), in
good agreement with the SDSS QSO luminosity function in Fan et al. (2001). We
note the unusual QSO FIRST 1413+4505 (z=3.11), which shows strong associated
Lyalpha absorption and an extreme observed luminosity, L about 2 x 10^(15)
solar luminosities.",2006-05-11T16:37:24Z
"Optical, Infrared, and Ultraviolet Observations of the X-Ray Flash GRB
  050416A","We present ultraviolet, optical, and infrared photometry of the afterglow of
the X-ray flash XRF 050416A taken between approximately 100 seconds and 36 days
after the burst. We find an intrinsic spectral slope between 1930 and 22,200
Angstrom of beta = -1.14 +/- 0.20 and a decay rate of alpha = -0.86 +/- 0.15.
There is no evidence for a change in the decay rate between approximately 0.7
and 4.7 days after the burst. Our data implies that there is no spectral break
between the optical and X-ray bands between 0.7 and 4.7 days after the burst,
and is consistent with the cooling break being redward of the K_s band (22,200
Angstrom) at 0.7 days. The combined ultraviolet/optical/infrared spectral
energy distribution shows no evidence for a significant amount of extinction in
the host galaxy along the line of sight to XRF 050416A. Our data suggest that
the extragalactic extinction along the line of sight to the burst is only
approximately A_V = 0.2 mag, which is significantly less than the extinction
expected from the hydrogen column density inferred from $X$-ray observations of
XRF 050416A assuming a dust-to-gas ratio similar to what is found for the Milky
Way. The observed extinction, however, is consistent with the dust-to-gas ratio
seen in the Small Magellanic Cloud. We suggest that XRF 050416A may have a
two-component jet similar to what has been proposed for GRB 030329. If this is
the case the lack of an observed jet break between 0.7 and 42 days is an
illusion due to emission from the wide jet dominating the afterglow after
approximately 1.5 days.",2006-04-13T19:06:16Z
Coma revealed as an extended hard X-rays source by INTEGRAL IBIS/ISGRI,"Aims. We report the INTEGRAL/IBIS observations of the Coma Cluster in the
hard X-ray/soft-ray domain. Methods. Since the Coma Cluster appears as an
extended source, its global intensity and significance cannot be directly
extracted with standard coded mask analysis. We used the method of imaging the
extended sources with a coded mask telescope developed by Renaud et al. (2006).
Results. The imaging capabilities and the sensitivity of the IBIS/ISGRI coded
mask instrument allows us to identify for the first time the site of the
emission above ~ 15 keV. We have studied the Coma Cluster morphology in the
18-30keV band and found that it follows the prediction based on X-ray
observations.We also bring constraints on the non-thermal mechanism
contribution at higher energies.",2006-06-06T11:44:17Z
"GMASS, Unveiling Distant Massive Galaxies with Spitzer","One of the main questions of galaxy formation is how and when galaxies
assembled their mass. Observations suggest that most mass assembly and star
formation occured at 1 < z < 3. However, in the same redshift range, fully
assembled old and massive galaxies co-exist with star-bursting systems still in
their assembling stage. In order to explore galaxy evolution in this critical
redshift range, we started a project called GMASS (Galaxy Mass Assembly
ultra-deep Spectroscopic Survey) based on an 145 hours ESO Large Program and
aimed at doing ultradeep spectroscopy with the VLT of a sample of high redshift
galaxies slected with IRAC/Spitzer m(4.5mu) < 23, z(phot) > 1.4) from the
GOODS-South/HUDF region. The selection at 4.5 micron is crucial to select high
redshift galaxies based on the stellar mass or objects affected by strong dust
extinction. The spectroscopic deep integration times (15 - 50 hours) are needed
to identify unambiguously the redshift and nature of these galaxies, which
redshifts are mostly in the ""desert"" where spectroscopy is traditionally
difficult due to the absence of strong emission lines at optical wavelengths.
The survey is almost complete and some preliminary results are presented here.",2006-04-06T14:01:07Z
Hubble Imaging Excludes Cosmic String Lens,"The galaxy image pair CSL-1 has been a leading candidate for a cosmic string
lens. High quality imaging data from the Hubble Space Telescope presented here
show that it is not a lens but a pair of galaxies. The galaxies show different
orientations of their principal axes, not consistent with any lens model. We
present a new direct test of the straight-string lens model, using a displaced
difference of the image from itself to exclude CSL-1 at high confidence.",2006-03-30T21:27:23Z
The masses of PSR J1911-5958A and its white dwarf companion,"We present spectroscopic and photometric observations of the optical
counterpart to PSR J1911-5958A, a millisecond pulsar located towards the
globular cluster NGC 6752. We measure radial velocities from the spectra and
determine the systemic radial velocity of the binary and the radial-velocity
amplitude of the white-dwarf orbit. Combined with the pulsar orbit obtained
from radio timing, we infer a mass ratio of Mpsr/Mwd=7.36+-0.25. The spectrum
of the counterpart is that of a hydrogen atmosphere, showing Balmer absorption
lines upto H12, and we identify the counterpart as a helium-core white dwarf of
spectral type DA5. Comparison of the spectra with hydrogen atmosphere models
yield a temperature Teff=10090+-150 K and a surface gravity log g=6.44+-0.20 cm
s^-2. Using mass-radius relations appropriate for low-mass helium-core white
dwarfs, we infer the white-dwarf mass Mwd=0.18+-0.02 Msun and radius
Rwd=0.043+-0.009 Rsun. Combined with the mass ratio, this constrains the pulsar
mass to Mpsr=1.40^+0.16_-0.10 Msun. If we instead use the white-dwarf spectrum
and the distance of NGC 6752 to determine the white-dwarf radius, we find
Rwd=0.058+-0.004 Rsun. For the observed temperature, the mass-radius relations
predict a white-dwarf mass of Mwd=0.175+-0.010 Msun, constraining the pulsar
mass to Mpsr=1.34+-0.08 Msun. We find that the white-dwarf radius determined
from the spectrum and the systemic radial velocity of the binary are only
marginally consistent with the values that are expected if PSR J1911-5958A is
associated with NGC 6752. We discuss possible causes to explain this
inconsistency, but conclude that our observations do not conclusively confirm
nor disprove the assocation of the pulsar binary with the globular cluster.",2006-03-10T14:07:25Z
Stability in MaVaN Models,"Mass-varying neutrino (MaVaN) models propose a source of dark energy in a new
scalar field called the acceleron. Recent work has shown that nonrelativistic
neutrino fields in these theories are unstable to inhomogeneous fluctuations,
and form structures that no longer behave as dark energy. One might expect that
in multiple-neutrino models, the lighter species could continue to act as a
source for the acceleron, generating dark energy without the help of heavier
species. This paper shows that by considering the evolution of the acceleron
field for a large class of models, the result of any neutrino component
becoming unstable is that all components become unstable within a short time on
cosmological scales. An alternate model employing a second scalar field in a
hybrid potential is shown to have stable MaVaN dark energy even in the presence
of unstable heavier components.",2006-06-01T19:09:04Z
"Superclusters of galaxies from the 2dF redshift survey. II. Comparison
  with simulations","We investigate properties of superclusters of galaxies found on the basis of
the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, and compare them with properties of
superclusters from the Millennium Simulation. We study the dependence of
various characteristics of superclusters on their distance from the observer,
on their total luminosity, and on their multiplicity. The multiplicity is
defined by the number of Density Field (DF) clusters in superclusters. Using
the multiplicity we divide superclusters into four richness classes: poor,
medium, rich and extremely rich. We show that superclusters are asymmetrical
and have multi-branching filamentary structure, with the degree of asymmetry
and filamentarity being higher for the more luminous and richer superclusters.
The comparison of real superclusters with Millennium superclusters shows that
most properties of simulated superclusters agree very well with real data, the
main differences being in the luminosity and multiplicity distributions.",2006-04-26T08:34:11Z
The origin and fate of short-period low-mass black-hole binaries,"We present results of a population synthesis study for semidetached short
orbital period binaries which contain low-mass(<1.5 Msun) donors and black hole
(>4 Msun) accretors. Evolution of these binaries is determined by nuclear
evolution of the donors and/or orbital angular momentum loss due to magnetic
braking by the stellar wind of the donors and gravitational wave radiation.
According to our model, the estimated total number of this type of black-hole
binaries in the Galaxy is about 10000. If the magnetic braking is described by
the Verbunt & Zwaan formula, the model predicts around 3000 transient systems
with periods >2 hours and around 300 luminous stable systems with periods
between 3 and 8 hours. Several dozens of these bright systems should be above
the RXTE ASM sensitivity limit. The absence of such systems implies that
angular momentum losses are reduced by a factor more than 2 with respect to the
Verbunt & Zwaan prescription. We show that it is unlikely that the transient
behaviour of black-hole short-period X-ray binaries is explained by the evolved
nature of the stellar companion. A substantial fraction of black-hole binaries
with periods >3 hours could be faint with truncated, stable cold accretion
discs as proposed by Menou et al. Most of the semidetached black-hole binaries
are expected to have periods shorter than ~2 hours. Properties of such, still
to be observed, very small mass-ratio (q<0.02) binaries are different from
those of their longer period cousins.",2006-04-20T15:29:56Z
"The spectral energy distribution of PKS 2004-447: a compact
  steep-spectrum source and possible radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy","(abridged) The spectral energy distribution (SED) of the compact steep
spectrum (CSS) source and possible radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy
(NLS1), PKS2004-447, is presented. Five out of six well studied RL NLS1 share
this dual classification (optically defined as a NLS1 with radio definition of
a CSS or giga-hertz peaked spectrum (GPS) source). The SED is created from
simultaneous observations at radio (ATCA), optical/NIR (Siding Spring) and
UV/X-ray (XMM-Newton) wavelengths. The X-ray data show evidence of short-term
variability, a possible soft excess, and negligible absorption. Together with
the rest of the SED, the X-ray emission is excessive in comparison to
synchrotron plus synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) models. The SED can be
described with a two component model consisting of extended synchrotron/SSC
emission with Comptonisation in the X-rays, though SSC models with a very high
electron-to-magnetic energy density ratio cannot be excluded either. The peak
emission in the SED appears to be in the near infrared, which can be attributed
to thermal emission from a dusty torus. Analysis of a non-contemporaneous, low
resolution optical spectrum suggests that the narrow-line region (NLR) is much
more reddened than the X-ray emitting region suggesting that the gas-to-dust
ratio in PKS2004-447 may be very different then in our own Galaxy. Long-term
radio monitoring of PKS2004-447 shows a rather constant light curve over nearly
a six month period with the exception of one outburst when the 6.65GHz flux
increased by ~35% over 19 days. In comparison to general samples of GPS
sources, which appear to be X-ray weak, NLS1-CSS/GPS sources possess stronger
X-ray emission relative to radio, and lower intrinsic absorption than GPS
sources of similar X-ray luminosity.",2006-04-22T06:45:55Z
"Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Three Year Results:
  Implications for Cosmology","A simple cosmological model with only six parameters (matter density, Omega_m
h^2, baryon density, Omega_b h^2, Hubble Constant, H_0, amplitude of
fluctuations, sigma_8, optical depth, tau, and a slope for the scalar
perturbation spectrum, n_s) fits not only the three year WMAP temperature and
polarization data, but also small scale CMB data, light element abundances,
large-scale structure observations, and the supernova luminosity/distance
relationship. Using WMAP data only, the best fit values for cosmological
parameters for the power-law flat LCDM model are (Omega_m h^2, Omega_b h^2, h,
n_s, tau, sigma_8) = 0.1277+0.0080-0.0079, 0.02229+-0.00073, 0.732+0.031-0.032,
0.958+-0.016, 0.089+-0.030, 0.761+0.049-0.048). The three year data
dramatically shrink the allowed volume in this six dimensional parameter space.
Assuming that the primordial fluctuations are adiabatic with a power law
spectrum, the WMAP data_alone_ require dark matter, and favor a spectral index
that is significantly less than the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles scale-invariant
spectrum (n_s=1, r=0). Models that suppress large-scale power through a running
spectral index or a large-scale cut-off in the power spectrum are a better fit
to the WMAP and small scale CMB data than the power-law LCDM model; however,
the improvement in the fit to the WMAP data is only Delta chi^2 = 3 for 1 extra
degree of freedom. The combination of WMAP and other astronomical data yields
significant constraints on the geometry of the universe, the equation of state
of the dark energy, the gravitational wave energy density, and neutrino
properties. Consistent with the predictions of simple inflationary theories, we
detect no significant deviations from Gaussianity in the CMB maps.",2006-03-19T18:35:44Z
"Modelling the Galactic Interstellar Extinction Distribution in Three
  Dimensions","The Two Micron All Sky Survey, along with the Stellar Population Synthesis
Model of the Galaxy, developed in Besancon, is used to calculate the extinction
distribution along different lines of sight. By combining many lines of sight,
the large scale distribution of interstellar material can be deduced. The
Galaxy model is used to provide the intrinsic colour of stars and their
probable distances, so that the near infrared colour excess, and hence the
extinction, may be calculated and its distance evaluated. Such a technique is
dependent on the model used, however we are able to show that moderate changes
in the model parameters result in insignificant changes in the predicted
extinction. This technique has now been applied to over 64000 lines of sight,
each separated by 15 arcmin, in the inner Galaxy (|l|<=100 deg, |b|<=10 deg).
Using our extinction map, we have derived the main characteristics of the large
scale structure of the dust distribution: scale height and warp of the ISM disc
as well as the angle of the dust in the Galactic Bar. This resulting extinction
map will be useful for studies of the inner Galaxy and its stellar populations.",2006-04-20T14:09:23Z

"Spiral stellar density waves and the flattening of abundance gradients
  in the warm gas component of spiral galaxies","Motivated by recent observations of plateaus and minima in the radial
abundance distributions of heavy elements in the Milky Way and some other
spiral galaxies, we propose a dynamical mechanism for the formation of such
features around corotation. Our numerical simulations show that the
non-axisymmetric gravitational field of spiral density waves generates cyclone
and anticylone gas flows in the vicinity of corotation. The anticyclones
flatten the pre-existing negative abundance gradients by exporting many more
atoms of heavy elements outside corotation than importing inside it. This
process is very efficient and forms plateaus of several kiloparsec in size
around corotation after two revolution periods of a galaxy. The strength of
anticyclones and, consequently, the sizes of plateaus depend on the pitch angle
of spiral arms and are expected to increase along the Hubble sequence.",2006-05-31T23:05:09Z
Slow Star Formation in Dense Gas: Evidence and Implications,"It has been known for more than 30 years that star formation in giant
molecular clouds (GMCs) is slow, in the sense that only ~1% of the gas forms
stars every free-fall time. This result is entirely independent of any
particular model of molecular cloud lifetime or evolution. Here we survey
observational data on higher density objects in the interstellar medium,
including infrared dark clouds and dense molecular clumps, to determine if
these objects form stars slowly like GMCs, or rapidly, converting a significant
fraction of their mass into stars in one free-fall time. We find no evidence
for a transition from slow to rapid star formation in structures covering three
orders of magnitude in density. This has important implications for models of
star formation, since competing models make differing predictions for the
characteristic density at which star formation should transition from slow to
rapid. The data are inconsistent with models that predict that star clusters
form rapidly and in free-fall collapse. Magnetic- and turbulence-regulated star
formation models can reproduce the observations qualitatively, and the
turbulence-regulated star formation model of Krumholz & McKee quantitatively
reproduces the infrared-HCN luminosity correlation recently reported by Gao &
Solomon. Slow star formation also implies that the process of star cluster
formation cannot be one of global collapse, but must instead proceed over many
free-fall times. This suggests that turbulence in star-forming clumps must be
driven, and that the competitive accretion mechanism does not operate in
typical cluster-forming molecular clumps.",2006-06-12T20:13:10Z
Structure formation in the quasispherical Szekeres model,"Structure formation in the Szekeres model is investigated. Since the Szekeres
model is an inhomogeneous model with no symmetries, it is possible to examine
the interaction of neighboring structures and its impact on the growth of a
density contrast. It has been found that the mass flow from voids to clusters
enhances the growth of the density contrast. In the model presented here, the
growth of the density contrast is almost 8 times faster than in the linear
approach.",2006-04-24T12:08:38Z
Predicted properties of RR Lyrae stars in the SDSS photometric system,"The luminosities and effective temperatures, as well as the whole bolometric
lightcurves of nonlinear convective RR Lyrae models with 0.0001<Z<0.006 are
transformed into the SDSS photometric system. The obtained ugriz lightcurves,
mean magnitudes and colors, pulsation amplitudes and color-color loops are
shown and analytical relations connecting pulsational to intrinsic stellar
parameters, similarly to the ones currently used in the Johnson-Cousins
filters, are derived. Finally the behaviour in the color-color planes is
compared with available observations in the literature and possible systematic
uncertainties affecting this comparison are discussed.",2006-07-10T16:39:30Z
"The N/O Plateau of Blue Compact Galaxies: Monte Carlo Simulations of the
  Observed Scatter","Chemical evolution models and Monte Carlo simulation techniques have been
combined for the first time to study the distribution of blue compact galaxies
on the N/O plateau. Each simulation comprises 70 individual chemical evolution
models. For each model, input parameters relating to a galaxy's star formation
history (bursting or continuous star formation, star formation efficiency),
galaxy age, and outflow rate are chosen randomly from ranges predetermined to
be relevant. Predicted abundance ratios from each simulation are collectively
overplotted onto the data to test its viability. We present our results both
with and without observational scatter applied to the model points. Our study
shows that most trial combinations of input parameters, including a simulation
comprising only simple models with instantaneous recycling, are successful in
reproducing the observed morphology of the N/O plateau once observational
scatter is added. Therefore simulations which include delay of nitrogen
injection are no longer favored over those which propose that most nitrogen is
produced by massive stars, if only the plateau morphology is used as the
principal constraint. The one scenario which clearly cannot explain plateau
morphology is one in which galaxy ages are allowed to range below 250 Myr. We
conclude that the present data for the N/O plateau are insufficient by
themselves for identifying the portion of the stellar mass spectrum most
responsible for cosmic nitrogen production.",2006-05-10T17:13:00Z
Planetary nebulae as probes for galactic chemical evolution,"The role of planetary nebulae as probes for the galactic chemical evolution
is reviewed. Their abundances throughout the Galaxy are discussed for key
elements, in particular oxygen and other alpha elements. The abundance
distribution derived from planetary nebulae leads to the establishment of
radial abundance gradients in the galactic disk that are important constraints
to model the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. The radial gradient, well
determined for the solar neighborhood, is examined for distinct regions. For
the galactic anticenter in particular, the observational data confirm results
from galactic evolution models that point to a decreasing in the gradient slope
at large galactocentric distances. The possible time evolution of the radial
gradient is also examined comparing samples of planetary nebulae of different
ages, and the results indicate that a flattening in the gradient occurred,
which is confirmed by some galactic evolution models. The galactic bulge is
another important region whose modeling can be constrained by observational
results obtained from planetary nebulae. Results derived in the last few years
indicate that bulge nebulae have an abundance distribution similar to that of
disk objects, however with a larger dispersion.",2006-04-28T19:41:39Z
Multi-wavelength afterglow observations of the high redshift GRB 050730,"GRB 050730 is a long duration high-redshift burst (z=3.967) discovered by
Swift. The afterglow shows variability and is well monitored over a wide
wavelength range. We present comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis of
the afterglow of GRB 050730 including observations from the millimeter to
X-rays. We use multi-wavelength afterglow data to understand the temporal and
spectral decay properties with superimposed variability of this high redshift
burst. Five telescopes were used to study the decaying afterglow of GRB 050730
in the B, V, r', R, i', I, J and K photometric pass bands. A spectral energy
distribution was constructed at 2.9 hours post-burst in the K, J, I, R, V and B
bands. X-ray data from the satellites Swift and XMM-Newton were used to study
the afterglow evolution at higher energies. The early afterglow shows
variability at early times and shows a steepening at ~0.1 days (8.6 ks) in the
B, V, r', R, i', I, J and K passbands. The early afterglow light curve decayed
with alpha_1 = -0.60+/-0.07 and alpha_2 = -1.71+/-0.06 based on R and I band
data. A millimeter detection of the afterglow around 3 days after the burst
shows an excess in comparison to predictions. The early X-ray light curve
observed by Swift is complex and contains flares. At late times the X-ray light
curve can be fit by a powerlaw alpha_x = -2.5+/-0.15 which is steeper than the
optical light curve. A spectral energy distribution (SED) was constructed at
\~2.9 hours after the burst. An electron energy index, p, of ~ 2.3 was
calculated using the SED and the photon index from the X-ray afterglow spectra
and indicates that the synchrotron cooling frequency nu_c is above observed
frequencies.",2006-07-20T13:44:31Z
"Neutron stars in globular clusters: formation and observational
  manifestations","Population synthesis is used to model the number of neutron stars in globular
clusters that are observed as LMXBs and millisecond PSRs. The dynamical
interaction between binary and single stars in a GC are assumed to take place
with a permanently replenished ""background"" of single stars whose density
distribution keeps track with the cluster evolution as a whole and evolution of
single stars. We use the hypothesis (Podsiadlowski et al) that NS forming in
binary systems from components with initial masses \sim 8-12 M_\odot during the
electron-capture collapse of the degenerate O-Ne-Mg core do not acquire a high
space velocities (kicks). The remaining NSs (i.e. from single stars with M>8
M_\odot or binary comonents with M>12 M_\odot) are assumed to be born with high
kicks, as found from obsrevations of single pulsars (Hobbs et al. 2005). Under
this assumption, a sizeable fraction of NSs remain in GCs (about 1000 NSs in a
GC with a mass of 5\times 10^5 M_\odot). The number of ms PSRs formed in the
cluster via accretion spin-up in binaries is then about 10, which is consistent
with observations. Our modelling reproduces the observed shape of the X-ray
luminosity function for accreting NSs in binaries with normal and degenerate
components and the distribution of spin periods of ms PSRs in GCs under the
assumption of accretion-driven magnetic field decay of NSs up to a bottom value
of 10^8 G. The number of LMXBs and ms PSRs dynamically expelling from GCs is
also calculated.",2006-05-04T05:13:04Z
The Clustering of Massive Halos,"The clustering properties of dark matter halos are a firm prediction of
modern theories of structure formation. We use two large volume,
high-resolution N-body simulations to study how the correlation function of
massive dark matter halos depends upon their mass and formation history. We
find that halos with the lowest concentrations are presently more clustered
than those of higher concentration, the size of the effect increasing with halo
mass; this agrees with trends found in studies of lower mass halos. The
clustering dependence on other characterizations of the full mass accretion
history appears weaker than the effect with concentration. Using the integrated
correlation function, marked correlation functions, and a power-law fit to the
correlation function, we find evidence that halos which have recently undergone
a major merger or a large mass gain have slightly enhanced clustering relative
to a randomly chosen population with the same mass distribution.",2006-06-28T21:50:39Z
"Sulphur abundances in disk stars as determined from the forbidden 10821
  A [SI] line","Aims: In this paper we aim to study the chemical evolution of sulphur in the
galactic disk, using a new optimal abundance indicator: the [SI] line at 10821
A. Similar to the optimal oxygen indicators, the [OI] lines, the [SI] line has
the virtues of being less sensitive to the assumed temperatures of the stars
investigated and of likely being less prone to non-LTE effects than other
tracers. Methods: High-resolution, near-infrared spectra of the [SI] line are
recorded using the Phoenix spectrometer on the Gemini South telescope. The
analysis is based on 1D, LTE model atmospheres using a homogeneous set of
stellar parameters. Results: The 10821 A [SI] line is suitable for an abundance
analysis of disk stars, and the sulphur abundances derived from it are
consistent with abundances derived from other tracers. We corroborate that, for
disk stars, the trend of sulphur-to-iron ratios with metallicity is similar to
that found for other alpha elements, supporting the idea of a common
nucleosynthetic origin.",2006-07-03T06:13:12Z
"New Chandra observations of the jet in 3C273. I. Softer X-ray than radio
  spectra and the X-ray emission mechanism","The jet in 3C273 is a high-power quasar jet with radio, optical and X-ray
emission whose size and brightness allow a detailed study of the emission
processes acting in it. We present deep Chandra observations of this jet and
analyse the spectral properties of the jet emission from radio through X-rays.
We find that the X-ray spectra are significantly softer than the radio spectra
in all regions of the bright part of the jet except for the first bright ""knot
A"", ruling out a model in which the X-ray emission from the entire jet arises
from beamed inverse-Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons
in a single-zone jet flow. Within two-zone jet models, we find that a
synchrotron origin for the jet's X-rays requires fewer additional assumptions
than an inverse-Compton model, especially if velocity shear leads to efficient
particle acceleration in jet flows.",2006-05-20T18:00:02Z
"An Observational Test for the Anthropic Origin of the Cosmological
  Constant","The existence of multiple regions of space beyond the observable Universe
(within the so-called ""multiverse"") where the vacuum energy density takes
different values, has been postulated as an explanation for the low non-zero
value observed for it in our Universe. It is often argued that our existence
pre-selects regions where the cosmological constant is sufficiently small to
allow galaxies like the Milky Way to form and intelligent life to emerge. Here
we propose a simple empirical test for this anthropic argument within the
boundaries of the observable Universe. We make use of the fact that dwarf
galaxies formed in our Universe at redshifts as high as z~10 when the mean
matter density was larger by a factor of ~10^3 than today. Existing technology
enables to check whether planets form in nearby dwarf galaxies and globular
clusters by searching for microlensing or transit events of background stars.
The oldest of these nearby systems may have formed at z~10. If planets are as
common per stellar mass in these descendents as they are in the Milky Way
galaxy, then the anthropic argument would be weakened considerably since
planets could have formed in our Universe even if the cosmological constant was
three orders of magnitude larger than observed. For a flat probability
distribution, this would imply that the probability for us to reside in a
region where the cosmological constant obtains its observed value is lower than
\~10^{-3}. A precise version of the anthropic argument could then be ruled-out
at a confidence level of ~99.9%, which constitutes a satisfactory measure of a
good experimental test.",2006-04-11T15:55:56Z
"The discovery of a significant sample of massive galaxies at redshifts 5
  < z < 6 in the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey Early Data Release","We have exploited the large area coverage of the combined UKIDSS Ultra Deep
Survey (UDS) and Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Survey (SXDS) to search for bright
Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at z >= 5. Using the available
optical+near-infrared photometry to efficiently exclude low-redshift
contaminants, we identify nine z >= 5 LBG candidates brighter than z'=25(AB)
within the 0.6 square degree overlap region between the UDS early data release
(EDR) and the optical coverage of the SXDS. Accounting for selection
incompleteness, we estimate the corresponding surface density of z >= 5 LBGs
with z'<=25(AB) to be 0.005+/-0.002 per square arcmin. Modelling of the
optical+near-infrared photometry constrains the candidates' redshifts to lie in
the range 5.1 < z < 5.9, and provides estimates for their stellar masses.
Although the stellar mass estimates are individually uncertain, a stacking
analysis suggests that the typical stellar mass of the LBG candidates is
>~5x10^10 Msun which, if confirmed, places them amongst the most massive
galaxies currently known at z >= 5. It is found that Lambda CDM structure
formation can produce sufficient numbers of dark matter halos at z >= 5 to
accommodate our estimated number density of massive LBGs for plausible values
of sigma_8 and the ratio of stellar to dark matter. Moreover, it is found that
recent galaxy formation models can also account for the existence of such
massive galaxies at z >= 5. Finally, no evidence is found for the existence of
LBGs with stellar masses in excess of ~3x10^11 Msun at this epoch, despite the
large co-moving volume surveyed.",2006-06-06T12:57:05Z
"Hot Dust and PAH Emission at Low Metallicity: A Spitzer Survey of Local
  Group and Other Nearby Dwarf Galaxies","We present Spitzer Space Telescope 4.5 and 8.0 micron imaging of 15 Local
Group and nearby dwarf galaxies. Our sample spans a range of more than one dex
in nebular metallicity and over three orders of magnitude in current star
formation rate, allowing us to examine the dependence of the diffuse 8 micron
emission, originating from hot dust and PAHs, on these parameters. We detect
prominent diffuse 8 micron emission in four of the most luminous galaxies in
the sample (IC 1613, IC 5152, NGC 55, and NGC 3109), low surface brightness
emission from four others (DDO 216, Sextans A, Sextans B, WLM), and no diffuse
emission from the remaining objects. We observe general correlations of the
diffuse 8 micron emission with both the current star formation rate and the
nebular metallicity of the galaxies in our sample. However, we also see
exceptions to these correlations that suggest other processes may also have a
significant effect on the generation of hot dust/PAH emission. These systems
all have evidence for old and intermediate age star formation, thus the lack of
diffuse 8 micron emission cannot be attributed to young galaxy ages. Also, we
find that winds are unlikely to explain the paucity of diffuse 8 micron
emission, since high resolution imaging of the neutral gas in these objects
show no evidence of blowout. Additionally, we propose the lack of diffuse 8
micron emission in low-metallicity systems may be due to the destruction of
dust grains by supernova shocks, assuming the timescale to regrow dust grains
and PAH molecules is long compared to the destruction timescale. The most
likely explanation for the observed weak diffuse 8 micron emission is at least
partly due to a general absence of dust (including PAHs), in agreement with
their low metallicities.",2006-03-31T20:20:11Z
Microquasar hadronic jets at very high-energy gamma-rays,"Microquasars (MQs) present emission over the whole spectrum, from radio
wavelengths to gamma-rays. The microquasar spectral energy distribution is very
complex, being a signature of the different physical processes that generate
the radiation emitted by these objects. In this work, we estimate the amount of
broad-band emission produced by relativistic protons, released from the jet of
a MQ, interacting with high density regions of the ISM. We show that a two
components source, the microquasar itself and the region of interaction between
the jets and the ISM, could be unveiled by the new instruments at high-energy
and very high-energy gamma-rays.",2006-05-18T18:28:11Z
Elemental abundances in the atmosphere of clump giants,"The aim of this paper is to provide the fundamental parameters and abundances
for a large sample of local clump giants with a high accuracy. The selection of
clump stars for the sample group was made applying a color - absolute magnitude
window to nearby Hipparcos stars. The abundances of carbon and nitrogen were
obtained from molecular synthetic spectrum, the Mg and Na abundances were
derived using the non-LTE approximation. The ""classical"" models of stellar
evolution without atomic diffusion and rotation-induced mixing were employed.
The atmospheric parameters (Teff, log g, [Fe/H], Vt) and Li, C, N, O, Na, Mg,
Si, Ca and Ni abundances in 177 clump giants of the Galactic disc were
determined. The underabundance of carbon, overabundance of nitrogen and
""normal"" abundance of oxygen were detected. A small sodium overabundance was
found. A possibility of a selection of the clump giants based on their chemical
composition and the evolutionary tracks was explored. The theoretical
predictions based on the classical stellar evolution models are in good
agreement with the observed surface variations of the carbon and nitrogen just
after the first dredge-up episode. The giants show the same behavior of the
dependencies of O, Mg, Ca, Si (alpha-elements) and Ni (iron-peak element)
abundances vs. [Fe/H] as dwarfs do. This allows one to use such abundance
ratios to study the chemical and dynamical evolution of the Galaxy.",2006-05-24T08:25:20Z
Parametric Strong Gravitational Lensing Analysis of Abell 1689,"(Abridged) We measure the mass distribution of galaxy cluster Abell 1689
within 0.3 Mpc/h_70 of the cluster centre using its strong lensing effect on 32
background galaxies. The multiple images are based on those of Broadhurst et
al. 2005 with some modifications. The cluster profile is explored further out
to ~2.5 Mpc/h_70 with weak lensing shear measurements from Broadhurst et al.
2005b. The masses of ~200 cluster galaxies are measured with Fundamental Plane
in order to accurately model the small scale mass structure in the cluster. The
galaxies are modelled as elliptical truncated isothermal spheres. The dark
matter component of the cluster is described by either non-singular isothermal
ellipsoids (NSIE) or elliptical versions of the universal dark matter profile
(ENFW). We use two dark matter haloes to model the smooth DM in the cluster.
The total mass profile is well described by either an NSIS profile with
sigma=1514+-18 km/s and core radius of r_c=71+-5kpc/h_70, or an NFW profile
with C=6.0+-0.5 and r_200=2.82+-0.11 Mpc/h_70. The errors are assumed to be due
to the error in assigning masses to the individual galaxies in the galaxy
component. The derived total mass is in good agreement with the mass profile of
Broadhurst et al. 05. Using also weak lensing we can constrain the profile
further out to r~2.5 Mpc/h_70. The best fit parameters are then sigma=1499+-15
km/s and r_c=66+-5 kpc/h_70 for the NSIS profile and C=7.6+-0.5 and
r_200=2.55+-0.07 Mpc/h_70 for the NFW profile. Using the same image
configuration as Broadhurst et al. 2005 we obtain a strong lensing model that
is superior to that of Broadhurst et al. 2005 (rms of 2.7'' compared to 3.2'').",2006-05-19T09:32:49Z
First Detection of HCO+ Emission at High Redshift,"We report the detection of HCO+(1-0) emission towards the Cloverleaf quasar
(z=2.56) through observations with the Very Large Array. This is the first
detection of ionized molecular gas emission at high redshift (z>2). HCO+
emission is a star formation indicator similar to HCN, tracing dense molecular
hydrogen gas (n(H_2) ~= 10^5 cm^{-3}) within star-forming molecular clouds. We
derive a lensing-corrected HCO+ line luminosity of L'(HCO+) = 3.5 x 10^9 K km/s
pc^2. Combining our new results with CO and HCN measurements from the
literature, we find a HCO+/CO luminosity ratio of 0.08 and a HCO+/HCN
luminosity ratio of 0.8. These ratios fall within the scatter of the same
relationships found for low-z star-forming galaxies. However, a HCO+/HCN
luminosity ratio close to unity would not be expected for the Cloverleaf if the
recently suggested relation between this ratio and the far-infrared luminosity
were to hold. We conclude that a ratio between HCO+ and HCN luminosity close to
1 is likely due to the fact that the emission from both lines is optically
thick and thermalized and emerges from dense regions of similar volumes. The
CO, HCN and HCO+ luminosities suggest that the Cloverleaf is a composite
AGN--starburst system, in agreement with the previous finding that about 20% of
the total infrared luminosity in this system results from dust heated by star
formation rather than heating by the AGN. We conclude that HCO+ is potentially
a good tracer for dense molecular gas at high redshift.",2006-05-17T21:52:25Z
X-ray Spectral Study of the Photoionized Stellar Wind in Vela~X-1,"We present results from quantitative modeling and spectral analysis of the
high mass X-ray binary Vela X-1 obtained with the Chandra HETGS. The spectra
exhibit emission lines from H-like and He-like ions driven by photoionization,
as well as fluorescent emission lines from several elements in lower charge
states. In order to interpret and make full use of the high-quality data, we
have developed a simulator, which calculates the ionization and thermal
structure of a stellar wind photoionized by an X-ray source, and performs Monte
Carlo simulations of X-ray photons propagating through the wind. The emergent
spectra are then computed as a function of the viewing angle accurately
accounting for photon transport in three dimensions including dynamics. From
comparisons of the observed spectra with the simulation results, we are able to
find the ionization structure and the geometrical distribution of material in
Vela X-1 that can reproduce the observed spectral line intensities and
continuum shapes at different orbital phases remarkably well. It is found that
a large fraction of X-ray emission lines from highly ionized ions are formed in
the region between the neutron star and the companion star. We also find that
the fluorescent X-ray lines must be produced in at least three distinct regions
--(1)the extended stellar wind, (2)reflection off the stellar photosphere, and
(3)in a distribution of dense material partially covering and possibly trailing
the neutron star, which may be associated with an accretion wake. Finally, from
detailed analysis of the emission lines, we demonstrate that the stellar wind
is affected by X-ray photoionization.",2006-07-03T14:00:47Z
"A Strong X-Ray Flux Ratio Anomaly in the Quadruply Lensed Quasar PG
  1115+080","PG 1115+080 is a quadruply lensed quasar at z=1.72 whose image positions are
well fit by simple models of the lens galaxy (at z=0.31). At optical
wavelengths, the bright close pair of images exhibits a modest flux ratio
anomaly (factors of ~1.2-1.4 over the past 22 years) with respect to these same
models. We show here that as observed in X-rays with Chandra, the flux ratio
anomaly is far more extreme, roughly a factor of 6. The contrasting flux ratio
anomalies in the optical and X-ray band confirm the microlensing hypothesis and
set a lower limit on the size of the optical continuum emission region that is
\~10-100 times larger than expected from a thin accretion disk model.",2006-04-06T21:31:28Z
"The potential for tidally heated icy and temperate moons around
  exoplanets","Moons of giant planets may represent an alternative to the classical picture
of habitable worlds. They may exist within the circumstellar habitable zone of
a parent star, and through tidal energy dissipation they may also offer
alternative habitable zones, where stellar insolation plays a secondary, or
complementary, role. We investigate the potential extent of stable satellite
orbits around a set of 74 known extrasolar giant planets located beyond 0.6 AU
from their parent stars - where moons should be long-lived with respect to
removal by stellar tides. Approximately 60% of these giant planets can sustain
satellites or moons in bands up to $\sim 0.04$ AU in width. For comparison, the
Galiean satellites extend to $\sim 0.013$ AU. We investigate the stellar
insolation that moons would experience for these exoplanet systems, and the
implications for sublimation loss of volatiles. We find that between 15 and 27%
of {\em all} known exoplanets may be capable of harboring small, icy, moons. In
addition, some 22-28% of all known exoplanets could harbor moons within a
``sublimation zone'', with insolation temperatures between 273 K and 170 K. A
simplified energy balance model is applied to the situation of temperate moons,
maintained by a combination of stellar insolation and tidal heat flow. We
demonstrate that large moons ($>0.1 $M$_{\oplus}$), at orbital radii
commensurate with those of the Galilean satellites, could maintain temperate,
or habitable, surface conditions during episodes of tidal heat dissipation of
the order 1-100 times that currently seen on Io. (Abridged).",2006-04-19T20:00:06Z
On Kinematic Substructure in the Sextans Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy,"We present multifiber echelle radial velocity results for 551 stars in the
Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy and identify 294 stars as probable Sextans
members. The projected velocity dispersion profile of the binned data remains
flat to a maximum angular radius of $30^{\prime}$. We introduce a nonparametric
technique for estimating the projected velocity dispersion surface, and use
this to search for kinematic substructure. Our data do not confirm previous
reports of a kinematically distinct stellar population at the Sextans center.
Instead we detect a region near the Sextans core radius that is kinematically
colder than the overall Sextans sample with 95% confidence.",2006-03-24T22:11:14Z
"First results of the Instrumentation Line for the deep-sea ANTARES

of the Optical Modules, their front-end electronics and readout system, as well
as the calibration devices of the detector. The in-situ measurement of the
Optical Module time response yields a resolution better than 0.5 ns. The
performance of the acoustic positioning system, which enables the spatial
reconstruction of the ANTARES detector with a precision of about 10 cm, is
verified. These results demonstrate that with the full ANTARES neutrino

  Scuti 2003): Discovery of an Asymmetric High-Velocity Wind in a Moderately
  Fast Nova","We present low-resolution ($R\sim 90$) and medium-resolution ($R\sim 2500$)
spectropolarimetry of Nova V475 Sct with the HBS instrument, mounted on the
0.91-m telescope at the Okayama Astrophysical Observatory, and with FOCAS,
mounted on the 8.2-m Subaru telescope. We estimated the interstellar
polarization toward the nova from the steady continuum polarization components
and H$\alpha$ line emission components. After subtracting the interstellar
polarization component from the observations, we found that the H$\alpha$
emission seen on 2003 October 7 was clearly polarized. In the polarized flux
spectrum, the H$\alpha$ emission had a distinct red wing extending to $\sim
+4900$ km s$^{-1}$ and a shoulder around $+3500$ km s$^{-1}$, showing a
constant position angle of linear polarization $\theta_{\rm *}\simeq
155\arcdeg\pm 15\arcdeg$. This suggests that the nova had an asymmetric outflow
with a velocity of $v_{\rm wind}\simeq 3500$ km s$^{-1}$ or more, which is six
times higher than the expansion velocity of the ionized shell at the same
epoch. Such a high-velocity component has not previously been reported for a
nova in the `moderately fast' speed class. Our observations suggest the
occurrence of violent mass-loss activity in the nova binary system even during
the common-envelope phase. The position angle of the polarization in the
H$\alpha$ wing is in good agreement with that of the continuum polarization
found on 2003 September 26 ($p_{\rm *}\simeq 0.4$--0.6 %), which disappeared
within the following 2 d. The uniformity of the PA between the continuum
polarization and the wing polarization on October 7 suggests that the axis of
the circumstellar asymmetry remained nearly constant during the period of our
observations.",2006-04-16T11:27:45Z
Shell-models of RMHD turbulence and the heating of solar coronal loops,"A simplified non-linear numerical model for the development of incompressible
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in the presence of a strong magnetic field B0 and
stratification, nicknamed Shell-Atm, is presented. In planes orthogonal to the
mean field, the non-linear incompressible dynamics is replaced by 2D
shell-models for the complex variables u and b, allowing one to reach large
Reynolds numbers while at the same time carrying out sufficiently long time
integrations to obtain a good statistics at moderate computational cost. The
shell-models of different planes are coupled by Alfven waves propagating along
B0. The model may be applied to open or closed magnetic field configurations
where the axial field dominates and the plasma pressure is low; here we apply
it to the specific case of a magnetic loop of the solar corona heated via
turbulence driven by photospheric motions, and we use statistics for its
analysis. The Alfven waves interact non-linearly and form turbulent spectra in
the directions perpendicular and, via propagation, also parallel to the mean
field. A heating function is obtained, and is shown to be intermittent; the
average heating is consistent with values required for sustaining a hot corona,
and is proportional to the aspect ratio of the loop to the power -1.5;
characteristic properties of heating events are distributed as power-laws.
Cross-correlations show a delay of dissipation compared to energy content.",2006-06-26T13:58:58Z
Search for Lambda-Doubling Transitions of SiH in Orion KL,"A recent submillimeter line survey of Orion KL claimed detection of SiH. This
paper reports on GBT observations of the 5.7 GHz Lambda-doubling transitions of
SiH in Orion. Many recombination lines, including C164-delta, are seen, but SiH
is not detected. The nondetection corresponds to an upper limit of 1.5 x 10^15
cm^-2 (4 sigma) for the beam-averaged column density of SiH. This suggests that
the fractional abundance of SiH in the extended ridge is no more than twice
that in the hot core.",2006-06-20T20:44:49Z
"Dark matter, and its darkness","Assuming the validity of the general relativistic description of gravitation
on astrophysical and cosmological length scales, we analytically infer that the
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology with Einsteinian cosmological constant,
and a vanishing spatial curvature constant, unambiguously requires significant
amount of dark matter. This requirement is consistent with other indications
for dark matter. The same spacetime symmetries that underlie the freely falling
frames of Einsteinian gravity also provide symmetries, which for the spin one
half representation space, furnish a novel construct that carries extremely
limited interactions with respect to the terrestrial detectors made of the
standard model material. Both the `luminous' and `dark' matter turn out to be
residents of the same representation space but they derive their respective
`luminosity' and `darkness' from either belonging to the sector with (CPT)^2 =
+ 1, or to the sector with (CPT)^2 = - 1.",2006-03-20T21:01:45Z
"Structural Parameters for Globular Clusters in NGC 5128. II: HST/ACS
  Imaging and New Clusters","We report the first results from an imaging program with the ACS camera on
HST designed to measure the structural characteristics of a wide range of
globular clusters in NGC 5128, the nearest giant elliptical galaxy. From 12
ACS/WFC fields, we have measured a total of 62 previously known globular
clusters and have discovered 69 new high-probability cluster candidates not
found in any previous work. We present magnitudes and color indices for all of
these, along with rough measurements of their effective diameters and
ellipticities. The luminosity distribution of this nearly-uncontaminated sample
of clusters matches well with the normal GCLF for giant elliptical galaxies,
and the cluster scale size and ellipticity distributions are similar to those
in the Milky Way system. The indication from this survey is that many hundreds
of individual clusters remain to be found with carefully designed search
techniques in the future. A very rough estimate of the total cluster population
from our data suggests N_GC = 1500 in NGC 5128, over all magnitudes and within
a projected radius R = 25' from the galaxy center.",2006-07-13T18:55:32Z
First astrophysical results from AMBER/VLTI,"The AMBER instrument installed at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) combines
three beams from as many telescopes to produce spectrally dispersed fringes
from milli-arcsecond angular scale in the near infrared. Two years after
installation, first scientific observations have been carried out during the
Science Demonstration Time and the Guaranteed Time mostly on bright sources due
to some VLTI limitations. In this paper, we review these first astrophysical
results and we show which types of completely new information is brought by
AMBER. The first astrophysical results have been mainly focusing on stellar
wind structure, kinematics, and its interaction with dust usually concentrated
in a disk. Because AMBER has dramatically increased the number of measures per
baseline, this instrument brings strong constraints on morphology and models
despite a relatively poor (u, v) coverage for each object.",2006-06-20T14:37:53Z
"Analysis of Saturn main rings by continuous wavelet transform with the
  complex Morlet wavelet","A new method based on continuous wavelet transform with the complex Morlet
wavelet to analyze Saturn main rings is presented. It allows to investigate in
detail the resonance zones and reveal the coexistence of waves with stable
periods and the wave trains with a variable instant period. This method is
based on the replacing the integration of the fast--oscillation function by the
solution of the partial differential equations. It is shown that such an
approach is an effective tool for the study the radial structure of Saturn's A,
B, and C rings. All the analyzed images were obtained from the Cassini
spacecraft during 2004--2005 years.",2006-06-06T17:09:26Z
"Long gamma-ray bursts and core-collapse supernovae have different
  environments","When massive stars exhaust their fuel they collapse and often produce the
extraordinarily bright explosions known as core-collapse supernovae. On
occasion, this stellar collapse also powers an even more brilliant relativistic
explosion known as a long-duration gamma-ray burst. One would then expect that
long gamma-ray bursts and core-collapse supernovae should be found in similar
galactic environments. Here we show that this expectation is wrong. We find
that the long gamma-ray bursts are far more concentrated on the very brightest
regions of their host galaxies than are the core-collapse supernovae.
Furthermore, the host galaxies of the long gamma-ray bursts are significantly
fainter and more irregular than the hosts of the core-collapse supernovae.
Together these results suggest that long-duration gamma-ray bursts are
associated with the most massive stars and may be restricted to galaxies of
limited chemical evolution. Our results directly imply that long gamma-ray
bursts are relatively rare in galaxies such as our own Milky Way.",2006-03-20T19:08:08Z
"Off-Line, Multi-Detector Intensity Interferometers I: Theory","Stellar amplitude interferometry is limited by the need to have optical
distances fixed and known to a fraction of the wavelength. We suggest reviving
intensity interferometry, which requires hardware which is many orders of
magnitude less accurate, at the cost of more limited sensitivity. We present an
algorithm to use the very high redundancy of a uniform linear array to increase
the sensitivity of the instrument by more than a hundredfold. When using an
array of 100 elements, each almost 100m in diameter, and conservative
technological improvements, we can achieve a limiting magnitude of about
mb=14.4. Digitization, storage, and off-line processing of all the data will
also enable interferometric image reconstruction from a single observation run,
and application of various algorithms at any later time. Coronagraphy,
selectively suppressing only the large scale structure of the source, can be
achieved by specific aperture shapes. We conclude that after three decades of
abandonment optical intensity interferometry deserves another review.",2006-03-04T21:30:04Z
"Concerning the instantaneous mass and the extent of an expanding
  universe","In this article we want to answer the cosmologically relevant question what,
with some good semantic and physical reason, could be called the mass of an
infinitely extended, homogeneously matter-filled and expanding universe. To
answer this question we produce a space-like sum of instantaneous cosmic energy
depositions surrounding equally each spacepoint in the homogeneous universe. We
calculate the added-up instantaneous cosmic energy per volume around an
arbitrary space point in the expanding universe. To carry out this sum we use
as basic metrics an analogy to the inner Schwarzschild metric applied to stars,
but this time applied to the spacepoint-related universe. It is then shown that
this leads to the added-up proper energy within a sphere of a finite outer
critical radius defining the point-related infinity. As a surprise this radius
turns out to be reciprocal to the square root of the prevailing average cosmic
energy density. The equivalent mass of the universe can then also be calculated
and, by the expression which is obtained here, shows a scaling with this
critical radius of this universe, a virtue of the universe which was already
often called for in earlier works by E.Mach, H.Thirring and F.Hoyle and others.
This radius on the other hand can be shown to be nearly equal to the
Schwarzschild radius of the so-defined mass of the universe.",2006-06-19T14:02:25Z
Modelling of asymmetric nebulae. II. Line profiles,"We present a tool, VELNEB_3D, which can be applied to the results of 3D
photoionization codes to generate emission line profiles, position-velocity
maps and 3D maps in any emission line by assuming an arbitrary velocity field.
  We give a few examples, based on our pseudo-3D photoionization code NEBU_3D
(Morisset, Stasinska and Pena, 2005) which show the potentiality and usefulness
of our tool. One example shows how complex line profiles can be obtained even
with a simple expansion law if the nebula is bipolar and the slit slightly
off-center. Another example shows different ways to produce line profiles that
could be attributed to a turbulent velocity field while there is no turbulence
in the model. A third example shows how, in certain circumstances, it is
possible to discriminate between two very different geometrical structures --
here a face-on blister and its ``spherical impostor'' -- when using appropriate
high resolution spectra. Finally, we show how our tool is able to generate 3D
maps, similar to the ones that can be obtained by observing extended nebulae
with integral field units.",2006-05-17T00:23:44Z
"Rates and properties of type Ia supernovae as a function of mass and
  star-formation in their host galaxies","(ABRIDGED) We show that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are formed within both
very young and old stellar populations, with observed rates that depend on the
stellar mass and mean star-formation rates (SFRs) of their host galaxies.
Models where the SN Ia rate depends solely on host galaxy stellar mass are
ruled out with 99% confidence. Our analysis is based on 100
spectroscopically-confirmed SNe Ia, plus 24 photometrically-classified events,
all from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) and distributed over 0.2<z<0.75.
Using multi-band photometry, we estimate stellar masses and SFRs for the SN Ia
host galaxies by fitting their broad-band spectral energy distributions with
the galaxy spectral synthesis code, PEGASE.2. We show that the SN Ia rate per
unit mass is proportional to the specific SFR of the parent galaxies -- more
vigorously star-forming galaxies host more SNe Ia per unit stellar mass,
broadly equivalent to the trend of increasing SN Ia rate in later-type galaxies
seen in the local universe. Following earlier suggestions for a simple
""two-component"" model approximating the SN Ia rate, we find bivariate linear
dependencies of the SN Ia rate on both the stellar masses and the mean SFRs of
the host systems. We also demonstrate a dependence of distant SN Ia light-curve
shapes on star-formation in the host galaxy, similar to trends observed
locally. Passive galaxies, with no star-formation, preferentially host
faster-declining/dimmer SNe Ia, while slower-declining/brighter events are only
found in systems with ongoing star-formation. We model the light-curve width
distribution in star-forming galaxies as the sum of a young component, and an
old component taken from the distribution in non-star-forming galaxies.",2006-05-18T14:24:31Z
"Solar ions in the heliosheath: a possible new source of heavy neutral
  atoms","We show that multiply ionized coronal C, N, O, Mg, Si, S ions carried by the
solar wind and neutralized by consecutive electron captures from neutral
interstellar atoms constitute an important new source of neutral atoms in the
inner heliosheath, with energies up to ~ 1 keV/n. In the model we developed,
the heavy ions are treated as test particles carried by hydrodynamic plasma
flow (with a Monte-Carlo description of interstellar neutrals) and undergoing
all relevant atomic processes determining the evolution of all charge-states of
considered species (radiative and dielectronic recombination, charge exchange,
photo-, and electron impact ionization). The total strength of the source is
from ~10^6 g/s for S to ~10^8 g/s for O, deposited as neutrals below the
heliopause. These atoms should provide, as they drift to supersonic wind
region, important sources of PUIs and eventually ACRs, especially for species
that are excluded from entering the heliosphere because of their ionization in
the LISM. The expected corresponding ENA fluxes at 1 AU are in the range 10^-4
- 10^0 at./(cm^2 s sr), depending on the species and direction (Table 2).",2006-04-28T13:39:15Z
"Physical viscosity in smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of
  galaxy clusters","Most hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy cluster formation carried out to
date have tried to model the cosmic gas as an ideal, inviscid fluid, where only
a small amount of (unwanted) numerical viscosity is present, arising from
practical limitations of the numerical method employed, and with a strength
that depends on numerical resolution. However, the physical viscosity of the
gas in hot galaxy clusters may in fact not be negligible, suggesting that a
self-consistent treatment that accounts for the internal gas friction would be
more appropriate. To allow such simulations using the smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) method, we derive a novel SPH formulation of the
Navier-Stokes and general heat transfer equations and implement them in the
GADGET-2 code. We include both shear and bulk viscosity stress tensors, as well
as saturation criteria that limit viscous stress transport where appropriate.
Adopting Braginskii's parameterization for the shear viscosity of hot gaseous
plasmas, we then study the influence of viscosity on the interplay between
AGN-inflated bubbles and the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM). We find
that certain bubble properties like morphology, maximum clustercentric radius
reached, or survival time depend quite sensitively on the assumed level of
viscosity. Interestingly, the sound waves launched into the ICM by the bubble
injection are damped by physical viscosity, establishing a non-local heating
process. Finally, we carry out cosmological simulations of galaxy cluster
formation with a viscous intracluster medium. Viscosity modifies the dynamics
of mergers and the motion of substructures through the cluster atmosphere.
Substructures are generally more efficiently stripped of their gas, leading to
prominent long gaseous tails behind infalling massive halos. (Abridged)",2006-05-11T19:58:41Z
"X-ray thermal coronae of galaxies in hot clusters -- ubiquity of
  embedded mini cooling cores","We present a systematic investigation of X-ray thermal coronae in 157
early-type galaxies and 22 late-type galaxies from a survey of 25 hot (kT>3
keV), nearby (z<0.05) clusters, based on CHANDRA archival data. Cool galactic
coronae (kT=0.5-1.1 keV generally) have been found to be very common, >60% in
NIR selected galaxies that are more luminous than 2L*, and >40% in L* < L_Ks <
2L* galaxies. These embedded coronae in hot clusters are generally smaller
(1.5-4 kpc radii), less luminous (<~ 10^41 erg s^-1), and less massive
(10^6.5-10^8 M_solar}) than coronae in poor environments, demonstrating the
negative effects of hot cluster environments on galactic coronae. Nevertheless,
these coronae still manage to survive ICM stripping, evaporation, rapid
cooling, and powerful AGN outflows, making them a rich source of information
about gas stripping, microscopic transport, and feedback processes in the
cluster environment. Heat conduction across the boundary of the coronae has to
be suppressed by a factor of >100, which implies the X-ray gas in early-type
galaxies is magnetized and the magnetic field plays an important role in energy
transfer. Stripping through transport processes (viscosity or turbulence) also
needs to be suppressed by at least a factor of ten at the coronal boundary...
(abridged) Diffuse thermal coronae have also been detected in at least 8 of 22
late-type (Sb or later) galaxies in our sample. Evidence for enhanced star
formation triggered by the ICM pressure has been found in four late-type
galaxies. The fraction of luminous X-ray AGN (>10^41 ergs s^-1) is not small (~
5%) in our sample.",2006-06-08T03:49:57Z
Are f(R) dark energy models cosmologically viable ?,"All $f(R)$ modified gravity theories are conformally identical to models of
quintessence in which matter is coupled to dark energy with a strong coupling.
This coupling induces a cosmological evolution radically different from
standard cosmology. We find that in all $f(R)$ theories that behave as a power
of $R$ at large or small $R$ (which include most of those proposed so far in
the literature) the scale factor during the matter phase grows as $t^{1/2}$
instead of the standard law $t^{2/3}$. This behaviour is grossly inconsistent
with cosmological observations (e.g. WMAP), thereby ruling out these models
even if they pass the supernovae test and can escape the local gravity
constraints.",2006-03-27T01:40:24Z
A Compact Supermassive Binary Black Hole System,"We report on the discovery of a supermassive binary black hole system in the
radio galaxy 0402+379, with a projected separation between the two black holes
of just 7.3 pc. This is the closest black hole pair yet found by more than two
orders of magnitude. These results are based upon recent multi-frequency
observations using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) which reveal two
compact, variable, flat-spectrum, active nuclei within the elliptical host
galaxy of 0402+379. Multi-epoch observations from the VLBA also provide
constraints on the total mass and dynamics of the system. Low spectral
resolution spectroscopy using the Hobby-Eberly Telescope indicates two velocity
systems with a combined mass of the two black holes of ~1.5 x 10^8 solar
masses. The two nuclei appear stationary while the jets emanating from the
weaker of the two nuclei appear to move out and terminate in bright hot spots.
The discovery of this system has implications for the number of close binary
black holes that might be sources of gravitational radiation. Green Bank
Telescope observations at 22 GHz to search for water masers in this interesting
system are also presented.",2006-04-03T20:33:32Z
"Unveiling the nature of INTEGRAL objects through optical spectroscopy.
  IV. A study of six new hard X-ray sources","We present further results from our ongoing optical spectrophotometric
campaign at the Astronomical Observatory of Bologna in Loiano (Italy) on
unidentified hard X-ray sources detected by INTEGRAL. We observed
spectroscopically the putative optical counterparts of the INTEGRAL sources IGR
J00234+6141, IGR J01583+6713, IGR J06074+2205, IGR J13091+1137 and IGR
J20286+2544. We find that the first two are Galactic objects, namely a
Cataclysmic Variable at a distance of about 300 pc and a Be/X transient
High-Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) located at about 6.4 kpc, respectively, whereas
the last one is identified with MCG +04-48-002, a Starburst/HII galaxy at
redshift z = 0.013 hiding a Seyfert 2 nucleus. We identify IGR J13091+1137 as
the (likely Seyfert 2 type) active nucleus of galaxy NGC 4992, which we
classify as an X-ray Bright, Optically Normal Galaxy; this is the first example
of this type of object to be detected by INTEGRAL, and one of the closest of
this class. We moreover confirm the possible Be/X nature of IGR J06074+2205,
and we estimate it to be at a distance of about 1 kpc. We also reexamine the
spectrum of the z = 0.087 elliptical radio galaxy PKS 0352-686, the possible
counterpart of the INTEGRAL source IGR J03532-6829, and we find that it is a BL
Lac. Physical parameters for these sources are also evaluated by discussing our
findings in the context of the available multiwavelength information. These
identifications further stress the importance of INTEGRAL in the study of the
hard X-ray spectrum of Active Galactic Nuclei, HMXBs and Cataclysmic Variables.",2006-04-22T09:49:54Z
Six Myths on the Virial Theorem for Interstellar Clouds,"It has been paid little or no attention to the implications that turbulent
fragmentation has on the validity of at least six common assumptions on the
Virial Theorem (VT), which are: (i) the only role of turbulent motions within a
cloud is to provide support against collapse, (ii) the surface terms are
negligible compared to the volumetric ones, (iii) the gravitational term is a
binding source for the clouds, (iv) the sign of the second-time derivative of
the moment of inertia determines whether the cloud is contracting or expanding,
(v) interstellar clouds are in Virial Equilibrium (VE), and (vi) Larson's
(1981) relations are the observational proof that clouds are in VE.
Interstellar clouds cannot fulfill these assumptions, however, because
turbulent fragmentation will induce flux of mass, moment and energy between the
clouds and their environment, and will favor local collapse while may disrupt
the clouds within a dynamical timescale. It is argued that, although the
observational and numerical evidence suggests that interstellar clouds are not
in VE, the so-called ``Virial Mass'' estimations, which actually should be
called ``energy-equipartition mass'' estimations, are good order-of magnitude
estimations of the actual mass of the clouds just because observational surveys
will tend to detect interstellar clouds appearing to be close to energy
equipartition. However, since clouds are actually out of VE, as suggested by
asymmetrical line profiles, they should be transient entities. These results
are compatible with observationally-based estimations for rapid star formation.
, and call into question the models for the star formation efficiency based on
clouds being in VE.",2006-06-05T14:59:42Z
The X-ray Properties of Optically-Selected Galaxy Clusters,"We stacked the X-ray data from the ROSAT All Sky Survey for over 4,000
clusters selected from the 2MASS catalog and divided into five richness
classes. We detected excess X-ray emission over background at the center of the
stacked images in all five richness bins. The interrelationships between the
mass, X-ray temperature and X-ray luminosity of the stacked clusters agree well
with those derived from catalogs of X-ray clusters. Poisson variance in the
number of galaxies occupying halos of a given mass leads to significant
differences between the average richness at fixed mass and the average mass at
fixed richness that we can model relatively easily using a simple model of the
halo occupation distribution. These statistical effects probably explain recent
results in which optically-selected clusters lie on the same X-ray
luminosity-temperature relations as local clusters but have lower optical
richnesses than observed for local clusters with the same X-ray properties.
When we further binned the clusters by redshift, we did not find significant
redshift-dependent biases in the sense that the X-ray luminosities for massive
clusters of fixed optical richness show little dependence on redshift beyond
that expected from the effects of Poisson fluctuations. Our results demonstrate
that stacking of RASS data from optically selected clusters can be a powerful
test for biases in cluster selection algorithms.",2006-05-31T20:00:16Z
Compact stars made of fermionic dark matter,"Compact stars consisting of fermions with arbitrary masses and interaction
strengths are studied by solving the structure equation of general relativity,
the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations. Scaling solutions are derived for a
free and an interacting Fermi gas and tested by numerical calculations. We
demonstrate that there is a unique mass-radius relation for compact stars made
of free fermions which is independent of the fermion mass. For sufficiently
strong interactions, the maximum stable mass of compact stars and its radius
are controlled by the parameter of the interaction, both increasing linearly
with the interaction strength. The mass-radius relation for compact stars made
of strongly interacting fermions shows that the radius remains approximately
constant for a wide range of compact star masses.",2006-05-30T15:55:02Z
"Observing with a space-borne gamma-ray telescope: selected results from
  INTEGRAL","The International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory, i.e. the INTEGRAL
satellite of ESA, in orbit since about 3 years, performs gamma-ray observations
of the sky in the 15 keV to 8 MeV energy range. Thanks to its imager IBIS, and
in particular the ISGRI detection plane based on 16384 CdTe pixels, it achieves
an excellent angular resolution (12 arcmin) for point source studies with good
continuum spectrum sensitivity. Thanks to its spectrometer SPI, based on 19
germanium detectors maintained at 85 K by a cryogenic system, located inside an
active BGO veto shield, it achieves excellent spectral resolution of about 2
keV for 1 MeV photons, which permits astrophysical gamma-ray line studies with
good narrow-line sensitivity. In this paper we review some goals of gamma-ray
astronomy from space and present the INTEGRAL satellite, in particular its
instruments ISGRI and SPI. Ground and in-flight calibration results from SPI
are presented, before presenting some selected astrophysical results from
INTEGRAL. In particular results on point source searches are presented,
followed by results on nuclear astrophysics, exemplified by the study of the
1809 keV gamma-ray line from radioactive 26Al nuclei produced by the ongoing
stellar nucleosynthesis in the Galaxy. Finally a review on the study of the
positron-electron annihilation in the Galactic center region, producing 511 keV
gamma-rays, is presented.",2006-06-22T09:37:53Z
The alignment of dark matter halos with the cosmic web,"We investigate the orientation of the axes and angular momentum of dark
matter halos with respect to their neighboring voids using high resolution
N-body cosmological simulations. We find that the minor axis of halos tends to
be aligned along the line joining the halo with the center of the void, and
that the major axis is perpendicular to this line. However, we find that the
angular momentum of halos does not have any particular orientation. These
results may provide information about the mechanisms whereby the large-scale
structure of the Universe affects galaxy formation and cast light upon the
issue of the orientation of galaxy disks with respect to their host halos.",2006-06-18T22:49:10Z
"Tomography of the intergalactic medium with Ly-alpha forests in close
  QSO pairs","We study the three-dimensional distribution of non virialised matter at z~2
using high resolution spectra of QSO pairs and simulated spectra drawn from
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We have collected the largest sample
of QSO pairs ever observed with UVES at the ESO-VLT, with angular separations
between ~1 and 14 arcmin. The observed correlation functions of the transmitted
flux in the HI Lyman alpha forest along and transverse to the lines of sight
are in good agreement implying that the distortions in redshift space due to
peculiar velocities are small. The clustering signal is significant up to
velocity separations of ~200 km/s, or about 3 h^{-1} comoving Mpc. The regions
at lower overdensity (rho/<rho> < 6.5) are still clustered but on smaller
scales (Delta v < 100 km/s). The observed and simulated correlation functions
are compatible at the 3 sigma level. A better concordance is obtained when only
the low overdensity regions are selected for the analysis or when the effective
optical depth of the simulated spectra is increased artificially, suggesting a
deficiency of strong lines in the simulated spectra. We found that also a lower
value of the power-law index of the temperature-density relation for the Lyman
alpha forest gas improves the agreement between observed and simulated results.
If confirmed, this would be consistent with other observations favouring a late
HeII reionization epoch (at z~3). We remark the detection of a significant
clustering signal in the cross correlation coefficient at a transverse velocity
separation Delta v_{\perp} ~500 km/s whose origin needs further investigation.",2006-07-31T14:00:02Z
Mosaicking with cosmic microwave background interferometers,"Measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies by
interferometers offer several advantages over single-dish observations. The
formalism for analyzing interferometer CMB data is well developed in the
flat-sky approximation, valid for small fields of view. As the area of sky is
increased to obtain finer spectral resolution, this approximation needs to be
relaxed. We extend the formalism for CMB interferometry, including both
temperature and polarization, to mosaics of observations covering arbitrarily
large areas of the sky, with each individual pointing lying within the flat-sky
approximation. We present a method for computing the correlation between
visibilities with arbitrary pointing centers and baselines and illustrate the
effects of sky curvature on the l-space resolution that can be obtained from a
mosaic.",2006-06-19T16:45:27Z
Helicity Observation of Weak and Strong Fields,"We report in this letter our analysis of a large sample of photospheric
vector magnetic field measurements. Our sample consists of 17200 vector
magnetograms obtained from January 1997 to August 2004 by Huairou Solar
Observing Station of the Chinese National Astronomical Observatory. Two
physical quantities, $\alpha$ and current helicity, are calculated and their
signs and amplitudes are studied in a search for solar cycle variations.
Different from other studies of the same type, we calculate these quantities
for weak ($100G<|B_z|<500G$) and strong ($|B_z|>1000G$) fields separately. For
weak fields, we find that the signs of both $\alpha$ and current helicity are
consistent with the established hemispheric rule during most years of the solar
cycle and their magnitudes show a rough tendency of decreasing with the
development of solar cycle. Analysis of strong fields gives an interesting
result: Both $\alpha$ and current helicity present a sign opposite to that of
weak fields. Implications of these observations on dynamo theory and helicity
production are also briefly discussed.",2006-06-09T14:02:29Z
"The Interplanetary Network Supplement to the BATSE 5B Catalog of Cosmic
  Gamma-Ray Bursts","We present Interplanetary Network (IPN) localization information for 343
gamma-ray bursts observed by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE)
between the end of the 4th BATSE catalog and the end of the Compton Gamma-Ray
Observatory (CGRO) mission, obtained by analyzing the arrival times of these
bursts at the Ulysses, Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR), and CGRO
spacecraft. For any given burst observed by CGRO and one other spacecraft,
arrival time analysis (or ""triangulation"") results in an annulus of possible
arrival directions whose half-width varies between 11 arcseconds and 21
degrees, depending on the intensity, time history, and arrival direction of the
burst,as well as the distance between the spacecraft. This annulus generally
intersects the BATSE error circle, resulting in an average reduction of the
area of a factor of 20. When all three spacecraft observe a burst, the result
is an error box whose area varies between 1 and 48000 square arcminutes,
resulting in an average reduction of the BATSE error circle area of a factor of
87.",2006-05-30T17:38:18Z
A method for detection of structure,"Context. In order to understand the evolution of molecular clouds it is
important to identify the departures from self-similarity associated with the
scales of self-gravity and the driving of turbulence.
  Aims. A method is described based on structure functions for determining
whether a region of gas, such as a molecular cloud, is fractal or contains
structure with characteristic scale sizes.
  Methods. Using artificial data containing structure it is shown that
derivatives of higher order structure functions provide a powerful way to
detect the presence of characteristic scales should any be present and to
estimate the size of such structures. The method is applied to observations of
hot H2 in the Kleinman-Low nebula, north of the Trapezium stars in the Orion
Molecular Cloud, including both brightness and velocity data. The method is
compared with other techniques such as Fourier transform and histogram
techniques.
  Results. It is found that the density structure, represented by H2 emission
brightness in the K-band (2-2.5micron), exhibits mean characteristic sizes of
110, 550, 1700 and 2700AU. The velocity data show the presence of structure at
140, 1500 and 3500AU. Compared with other techniques such as Fourier transform
or histogram, the method appears both more sensitive to characteristic scales
and easier to interpret.",2006-06-07T14:22:30Z
Models of inflation with primordial non-Gaussianities,"We present a class of models in which the primordial metric fluctuations do
not necessarily obey Gaussian statistics. These models are realizations of
mechanisms in which non-Gaussianity is first generated by a light scalar field
and then transferred into curvature fluctuations during or at the end of
inflation. For this class of models we present generic results for the
probability distribution functions of the metric perturbation at the end of
inflation. It is stressed that finite volume effects can induce non trivial
effects that we sketch.",2006-04-10T12:57:21Z
"The Discovery of Three New z>5 Quasars in the AGN and Galaxy Evolution
  Survey","We present the discovery of three z>5 quasars in the AGN and Galaxy Evolution
Survey (AGES) spectroscopic observations of the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey
(NDWFS) Bootes Field. These quasars were selected as part of a larger Spitzer
mid-infrared quasar sample with no selection based on optical colors. The
highest redshift object, NDWFS J142516.3+325409, z=5.85, is the
lowest-luminosity z>5.8 quasar currently known. We compare mid-infrared
techniques for identifying z>5 quasars to more traditional optical techniques
and show that mid-infrared colors allow for selection of high-redshift quasars
even at redshifts where quasars lie near the optical stellar locus and at z>7
where optical selection is impossible. Using the superb multi-wavelength
coverage available in the NDWFS Bootes field, we construct the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of high-redshift quasars from observed Bw-band to 24
microns (rest-frame 600 Angstroms - 3.7 microns). We show that the three
high-redshift quasars have quite similar SEDs, and the rest-frame composite SED
of low-redshift quasars from the literature shows little evolution compared to
our high-redshift objects. We compare the number of z>5 quasars we have
discovered to the expected number from published quasar luminosity functions.
While analyses of the quasar luminosity function are tenuous based on only
three objects, we find that a relatively steep luminosity function with Psi
L^(-3.2) provides the best agreement with the number of high-redshift quasars
discovered in our survey.",2006-05-01T16:48:22Z
Galactic Nuclei and Jets in Wave Gravity,"""Wave gravity"" refers to a quantum-mechanical gravity theory introduced in
two previous papers [1,2]. Although based on the optics of de Broglie waves
instead of curved space-time, it agrees with the standard tests of general
relativity. As in that theory, galactic nuclei are dark objects where gravity
prevents the escape of most radiation. In this case, collapse is counteracted
by rising internal pressure and black hole singularities don't occur. Unlike
black holes, these nuclei can have internal magnetic fields, and high-energy
plasma can escape along magnetic field lines closely aligned with the
gravitational field direction. This allows a different model of jets from
active galactic nuclei, where jets can arise without direct fueling by
accretion disks. It also offers a new basis for the tight correlation observed
[13] between the masses of galactic nuclei and their hosts.",2006-06-20T17:35:16Z
Outflows from Massive YSOs as Seen with the Infrared Array Camera,"The bipolar outflow from the massive star forming cluster in DR21 is one of
the most powerful known, and in IRAC images the outflow stands out by virtue of
its brightness at 4.5 um (Band 2). Indeed, IRAC images of many galactic and
extragalactic star formation regions feature prominent Band 2 morphologies. We
have analyzed archival ISOSWS spectra of the DR21 outflow, and compare them to
updated H2 shocked and UV-excitation models. We find that H2 line emission
contributes about 50% of the flux of the IRAC bands at 3.6 um, 4.5 um , and 5.8
um, and is a significant contributor to the 8.0 um band as well, and confirm
that the outflow contains multiple excitation mechanisms. Other potentially
strong features, in particular Br alpha and CO emission, have been suggested as
contributing to IRAC fluxes in outflows, but they are weak or absent in DR21;
surprisingly, there also is no evidence for strong PAH emission. The results
imply that IRAC images can be a powerful detector of, and diagnostic for,
outflows caused by massive star formation activity in our galaxy, and in other
galaxies as well. They also suggest that IRAC color-color diagnostic diagrams
may need to take into account the possible influence of these strong emission
lines. IRAC images of the general ISM in the region, away from the outflow, are
in approximate but not precise agreement with theoretical models.",2006-03-15T20:57:03Z
"Direct measurement of the size of 2003 UB313 from the Hubble Space
  Telescope","We have used the Hubble Space Telescope to directly measure the angular size
of the large Kuiper belt object 2003 UB313. By carefully calibrating the point
spread function of a nearby field star, we measure the size of 2003 UB313 to be
34.3$\pm$1.4 milliarcseconds, corresponding to a diameter of 2400$\pm$100 km or
a size $\sim5$% larger than Pluto. The V band geometric albedo of 2003 UB313 is
$86\pm7$%. The extremely high albedo is consistent with the frosty methane
spectrum, the lack of red coloring, and the lack of observed photometric
variation on the surface of 2003 UB313. Methane photolysis should quickly
darken the surface of 2003 UB313, but continuous evaporation and redeposition
of surface ices appears capable of maintaining the extreme alebdo of this body.",2006-04-11T17:18:35Z

HI content in galaxies in loose groups,"Gas deficiency in cluster spirals is well known and ram-pressure stripping is
considered the main gas removal mechanism. In some compact groups too gas
deficiency is reported. However, gas deficiency in loose groups is not yet well
established. Lower dispersion of the member velocities and the lower density of
the intra-group medium in small loose groups favour tidal stripping as the main
gas removal process in them. Recent releases of data from HI Parkes all sky
survey (HIPASS) and catalogues of nearby loose groups with associated diffuse
X-ray emission have allowed us to test this notion. In this paper, we address
the following questions: (a) do galaxies in groups with diffuse X-ray emission
statistically have lower gas content compared to the ones in groups without
diffuse X-ray emission? (b) does HI deficiency vary with the X-ray luminosity
of the loose group in a systematic way? We find that (a) galaxies in groups
with diffuse X-ray emission, on average, are HI deficient, and have lost more
gas compared to those in groups without X-ray emission; the later are found not
to have significant HI deficiency; (b) no systematic dependence of the HI
deficiency with X-ray luminosity is found. Ram pressure assisted tidal
stripping and evaporation by thermal conduction are the two possible mechanisms
to account for this excess gas loss.",2006-04-03T08:59:17Z
"GaBoDS: The Garching-Bonn Deep Survey -- IX. A sample of 158
  shear-selected mass concentration candidates","The aim of the present work is the construction of a mass-selected galaxy
cluster sample based on weak gravitational lensing methods. This sample will be
subject to spectroscopic follow-up observations.
  We apply the mass aperture statistics and a derivative of it to 19 square
degrees of high quality, single colour wide field imaging data obtained with
the WFI@MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope. For the statistics a family of filter functions
is used that approximates the expected tangential radial shear profile and thus
allows for the efficient detection of mass concentrations.
  We identify 158 possible mass concentrations. This is the first time that
such a large and blindly selected sample is published. 72 of the detections are
associated with concentrations of bright galaxies. For about 22 of those we
found spectra in the literature, indicating or proving that the galaxies seen
are indeed spatially concentrated. 15 of those were previously known to be
clusters or have meanwhile been secured as such. We currently follow-up a
larger number of them spectroscopically to obtain deeper insight into their
physical properties. The remaining 55% of the possible mass concentrations
found are not associated with any optical light, or could not be classified
unambiguously. We show that those ""dark"" detections are to a significant degree
due to noise, and appear preferentially in shallow data.",2006-07-03T13:42:47Z
Inhomogeneous Big Bang Nucleosynthesis Revisited,"We reanalyze the allowed parameters for inhomogeneous big bang
nucleosynthesis in light of the WMAP constraints on the baryon-to-photon ratio
and a recent measurement which has set the neutron lifetime to be 878.5 +/- 0.7
+/- 0.3 seconds. For a set baryon-to-photon ratio the new lifetime reduces the
mass fraction of He4 by 0.0015 but does not significantly change the abundances
of other isotopes. This enlarges the region of concordance between He4 and
deuterium in the parameter space of the baryon-to-photon ratio and the IBBN
distance scale. The Li7 abundance can be brought into concordance with observed
He4 and deuterium abundances by using depletion factors as high as 9.3. The
WMAP constraints, however, severely limit the allowed comoving (T = 100 GK)
inhomogeneity distance scale to (1.3 - 2.6)x10^5 cm.",2006-03-30T20:24:44Z
"Discovery of new Milky Way star cluster candidates in the 2MASS point
  source catalog. V. Follow-up observations of the young stellar cluster
  candidates RCW87, [BDSB2003]164 and [DBSB2003]172","Massive clusters are more often found in actively star forming galaxies than
in quiescent ones, similar to the Milky Way. We have carried out an extensive
survey of obscured Milky Way clusters to determine whether our Galaxy is still
forming such objects. Near-infrared spectral classification of some probable
cluster members was used to derive the distances to the cluster candidates.
Isochrone analysis of deep near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams allowed us to
obtain age and mass estimates. We report the physical parameters of three
cluster candidates:
  RCW87 is approx. 25 Myr old, located at a distance of D=7.6 Kpc in the
general direction of the Galactic center. Adding the mass of the suspected
cluster members we obtain an estimated total cluster mass of approx. 10300
solar masses. The mid-infrared photometry indicates that some next-generation
star formation is on-going in the associated HII region, probably triggered by
supernovae or stellar wind from the older stars in RCW87.
  The brightest member of [BDSB2003]164 is an O5V type star, based on our
spectroscopy. This limits the cluster age to less than a few million years. The
estimated total mass is approx. 1760 solar masses and the distance is D=3.2
Kpc.
  [DBSB2003]172 lacks central concentration and most likely this is not a
cluster but an extended star forming region.
  The high mass of RCW87 -- if confirmed -- puts this object in line with
Arches and Quintuplet, among the most young massive clusters in the Galaxy.
Further study is necessary to confirm this important result.",2006-05-20T00:07:01Z
"Perturbations of ionization fractions at the cosmological recombination
  epoch","A development of perturbations of number densities of ions and electrons
during recombination epoch is analysed. The equations for relative
perturbations of ionization fractions were derived from the system of equations
for accurate computation of the ionization history of the early Universe given
by Seager et al. (1999,2000). It is shown that strong dependence of ionization
and recombination rates on the density and temperature of plasma provides the
significant deviations of amplitudes of ionization fractions relative
perturbations from ones of baryon matter density adiabatic perturbations. Such
deviations are most prominent for cosmological adiabatic perturbations of
scales larger than sound horizon at recombination epoch. The amplitudes of
relative perturbations of number densities of electrons and protons at last
scattering surface exceed by factor of $\simeq$5 the amplitude of relative
perturbation of baryons total number density, for helium ions this ratio
reaches the value of $\simeq$18. For subhorizon cosmological perturbations
these ratios appear to be essentially lesser and depend on oscillation phase at
the moment of decoupling. These perturbations of number densities of ions and
electrons at recombination epoch do not contribute to the intrinsic plasma
temperature fluctuations but cause the ''corrugation'' of last scattering
surface in optical depth, $\delta z_{dec}/(z_{dec}+1)\approx -\delta_b/3$, at
scales larger than sound horizon. It may result into noticeable changes of
precalculated values of CMB polarization pattern at several degrees angular
scales.",2006-03-24T16:11:57Z
Hot DB White Dwarfs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,"We present ugriz photometry and optical spectroscopy for 28 DB and DO white
dwarfs with temperatures between 28,000K and 45,000K. About 10 of these are
particularly well-observed; the remainder are candidates. These are the hottest
DB stars yet found, and they populate the ""DB gap"" between the hotter DO stars
and the familiar DB stars cooler than 30,000K. Nevertheless, after carefully
matching the survey volumes, we find that the ratio of DA stars to DB/DO stars
is a factor of 2.5 larger at 30,000 K than at 20,000 K, suggesting that the ""DB
gap"" is indeed deficient and that some kind of atmospheric transformation takes
place in roughly 10% of DA stars as they cool from 30,000 K to 20,000 K.",2006-06-28T22:40:59Z
Distribution of dust clouds around the central engine of NGC 1068,"We studied the distribution of dust clouds around the central engine of NGC
1068 based on shifted-and-added 8.8 - 12.3 micron (MIR) multi-filter images and
3.0 - 3.9 micron (L-band) spectra obtained with the Subaru Telescope. In a
region of 100 pc (1.4"") around the central peak, we successfully constructed
maps of color temperatures and emissivities of the MIR and L-band continua as
well as the 9.7 micron and 3.4 micron dust features with spatial resolutions of
26 pc (0.37"") in the MIR and 22 pc (0.3"") in the L-band. Our main results are:
1) color temperature of the MIR continuum scatters around the thermal
equilibrium temperature with the central engine as the heat source while that
of the L-band continuum is higher and independent upon distance from the
central engine; 2) the peak of the 9.7 micron silicate absorption feature is
shifted to a longer wavelength at some locations; 3) the ratio of the optical
depths of the dust features is different from the Galactic values and show
complicated spatial distribution; and 4) there is a pie shaped warm dust cloud
as an enhancement in the emissivity of the MIR continuum extending about 50 pc
to the north from the central engine. We speculate that material falls into the
central engine through this cloud.",2006-05-19T01:24:30Z
"The Topology and Polarisation of Subbeams Associated with the `Drifting'
  Subpulse Emission of Pulsar B0943+10 -- IV. Q-to-B-Mode Recovery Dynamics","Pulsar B0943+10 is well known for its `B' (burst) mode, characterized by
accurately drifting subpulses, in contrast to its chaotic `Q' (quiet) mode. Six
new Arecibo observations at 327 MHz with durations of 2+ hours each have shed
considerable light on the modal dynamics of this pulsar. Of these, three were
found to be exclusively `B' mode, and three were discovered to exhibit
transitions from the `Q' to the `B' mode. One of these observations has
permitted us to determine the circulation time of the subbeam carousel in the
`Q' mode for the first time, at some 36.4$\pm$0.9 stellar rotation periods. The
onset of the `B' mode is then observed to commence similarly in all three
observations. The initial circulation time is about 36 periods and relaxes to
nearly 38 periods in a roughly exponential fashion with a characteristic time
of some 1.2 hours. This is the longest characteristic time ever found in a
mode-switching pulsar. Moreover, just after the `B'-mode onset the pulsar
exhibits a symmetrical resolved-double profile form with a somewhat stronger
trailing component, but this second component slowly dies away leaving the
usual single `B'-mode profile with the longitude of the magnetic axis falling
at about its trailing half power point. Thus it would appear that Q-to-B- and
B-to-Q-transitions have different characteristic times. Some speculations are
given on the nature of this slow modal alternation.",2006-03-29T02:58:49Z
A model for the infrared emission of FSC 10214+4724,"A model for the infrared emission of the high redshift ultraluminous infrared
galaxy FSC 10214+4724 is presented. The model assumes three components of
emission: a dusty torus viewed edge-on, clouds that are associated with the
narrow-line region and a highly obscured starburst. It is demonstrated that the
presence of clouds in the narrow-line region, with a covering factor of 17%,
can explain why the mid-infrared spectrum of FSC 10214+4724 shows a silicate
feature in emission despite the fact that its torus is viewed edge-on. It is
also shown that the same model, but with the torus viewed face-on, predicts a
spectrum with silicate emission features that is characteristic of the spectra
of quasars recently observed with Spitzer.",2006-06-29T10:33:36Z
GaBoDS: The Garching-Bonn Deep Survey: VI. Cosmic shear analysis,"Aims. We present a cosmic shear analysis and data validation of 15 square
degree high-quality R-band data of the Garching-Bonn Deep Survey obtained with
the Wide Field Imager of the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope. Methods. We measure the
two-point shear correlation functions to calculate the aperture mass
dispersion. Both statistics are used to perform the data quality control.
Combining the cosmic shear signal with a photometric redshift distribution of a
galaxy sub-sample obtained from two square degree of UBVRI-band observations of
the Deep Public Survey we determine constraints for the matter density Omega_m,
the mass power spectrum normalisation sigma_8 and the dark energy density
Omega_Lambda in the magnitude interval R in [21.5,24.5]. In this magnitude
interval the effective number density of source galaxies is n=12.5/sq. arcmin,
and their mean redshift is z_m=0.78. To estimate the posterior likelihood we
employ the Monte Carlo Markov Chain method. Results. Using the aperture mass
dispersion we obtain for the mass power spectrum normalisation sigma_8=0.80 +-
0.10 (1 sigma statistical error) at a fixed matter density Omega_m=0.30

the Hubble parameter and the uncertainties in the fitted redshift distribution.",2006-06-23T13:23:02Z
"HETE-2 Localizations and Observations of Four Short Gamma-Ray Bursts:
  GRBs 010326B, 040802, 051211 and 060121","Here we report the localizations and properties of four short-duration GRBs
localized by the High Energy Transient Explorer 2 satellite (HETE-2): GRBs
010326B, 040802, 051211 and 060121, all of which were detected by the French
Gamma Telescope (Fregate) and localized with the Wide-field X-ray Monitor (WXM)
and/or Soft X-ray Camera (SXC) instruments. We discuss eight possible criteria
for determining whether these GRBs are ""short population bursts"" (SPBs) or
""long population bursts"" (LPBs). These criteria are (1) duration, (2) pulse
widths, (3) spectral hardness, (4) spectral lag, (5) energy Egamma radiated in
gamma rays (or equivalently, the kinetic energy E_KE of the GRB jet), (6)
existence of a long, soft bump following the burst, (7) location of the burst
in the host galaxy, and (8) type of host galaxy. In particular, we have
developed a likelihood method for determining the probability that a burst is
an SPB or a LPB on the basis of its T90 duration alone. A striking feature of
the resulting probability distribution is that the T90 duration at which a
burst has an equal probability of being a SPB or a LPB is T90 = 5 s, not T90 =
2 s, as is often used. All four short-duration bursts discussed in detail in
this paper have T90 durations in the Fregate 30-400 keV energy band of 1.90,
2.31, 4.25, and 1.97 sec, respectively, yielding probabilities P(S|T90) = 0.97,
0.91, 0.60, and 0.95 that these bursts are SPBs on the basis of their T90
durations alone. All four bursts also have spectral lags consistent with zero.
These results provide strong evidence that all four GRBs are SPBs (abstract
continues).",2006-05-22T19:48:16Z
Large-Scale Radio and X-ray Jets in the Highest Redshift Quasars,"We describe our program to search for and study the kilo-parsec scale radio

will shed light on this problem.",2006-06-12T02:00:40Z
Spitzer Far-Infrared Detections of Cold Circumstellar Disks,"Observations at 70 microns with the Spitzer Space Telescope have detected
several stellar systems within 65 pc of the Sun. Of 18 presumably young systems
detected in this study, as many as 15 have 70-micron emission in excess of that
expected from their stellar photospheres. Five of the systems with excesses are
members of the Tucanae Association. The 70-micron excesses range from a factor
of ~2 to nearly 30 times the expected photospheric emission from these stars.
In contrast to the 70-micron properties of these systems, there is evidence for
an emission excess at 24 microns for only HD 3003, confirming previous results
for this star. The lack of a strong 24-micron excess in most of these systems
suggests that the circumstellar dust producing the IR excesses is relatively
cool (T_dust < 150 K) and that there is little IR-emitting material within the
inner few AU of the primary stars. Many of these systems lie close enough to
Earth that the distribution of the dust producing the IR excesses might be
imaged in scattered light at optical and near-IR wavelengths.",2006-05-13T00:32:29Z
Challenges in optics for Extremely Large Telescope instrumentation,"We describe and summarize the optical challenges for future instrumentation
for Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs). Knowing the complex instrumental
requirements is crucial for the successful design of 30-60m aperture
telescopes. After all, the success of ELTs will heavily rely on its
instrumentation and this, in turn, will depend on the ability to produce large
and ultra-precise optical components like light-weight mirrors, aspheric
lenses, segmented filters, and large gratings. New materials and manufacturing
processes are currently under study, both at research institutes and in
industry. In the present paper, we report on its progress with particular
emphasize on volume-phase-holographic gratings, photochromic materials,
sintered silicon-carbide mirrors, ion-beam figuring, ultra-precision surfaces,
and free-form optics. All are promising technologies opening new degrees of
freedom to optical designers. New optronic-mechanical systems will enable
efficient use of the very large focal planes. We also provide exploratory
descriptions of ""old"" and ""new"" optical technologies together with suggestions
to instrument designers to overcome some of the challenges placed by ELT
instrumentation.",2006-03-28T13:26:29Z
"The Hard X-ray Spectral Slope as an Accretion-Rate Indicator in
  Radio-Quiet Active Galactic Nuclei","We present new XMM-Newton observations of two luminous and high
accretion-rate radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z~2. Together with
archival X-ray and rest-frame optical spectra of three sources with similar
properties as well as 25 moderate-luminosity radio-quiet AGNs at z<0.5, we
investigate, for the first time, the dependence of the hard (>~2 keV) X-ray
power-law photon index on the broad H_beta emission-line width and on the
accretion rate across ~3 orders of magnitude in AGN luminosity. Provided the
accretion rates of the five luminous sources can be estimated by extrapolating
the well-known broad-line region size-luminosity relation to high luminosities,
we find that the photon indices of these sources, while consistent with those
expected from their accretion rates, are significantly higher than expected
from the widths of their H_beta lines. We argue that, within the limits of our
sample, the hard-X-ray photon index depends primarily on the accretion rate.",2006-06-15T20:00:07Z
"High resolution optical spectroscopy of an LBV-candidate inside the
  CygOB2 association","For the first time, we obtained the high-resolution (R=15000 and 60000)
optical spectra for the extremely luminous star No.12, associated with the
IR-source IRAS20308+4104, a member of the CygOB2 association. We have found
about 200 spectral features in range 4552-7939AA, including the interstellar
NaI, KI lines and numerous DIBs, which are the strongest absorption lines in
the spectrum, along with the HeI, CII, and SiII lines. A two-dimensional
spectral classification indicates that the spectral type is B5+/-0.5 Ia+. Our
analysis of the Vr data shows the presence of a Vr gradient in the stellar
atmosphere, caused by the infall of matter onto the star. The strong Halpha
emission displays broad Thompson wings and time-variable core absorption,
providing evidence that the stellar wind is inhomogeneous, and a slightly
blue-shifted PCyg type absorption profile. We concluded that the wind is
variable in time.",2006-05-19T06:44:58Z
"Precision Measurements of Higher-Order Angular Galaxy Correlations Using
  11 Million SDSS Galaxies","We present estimates of the N-point galaxy area-averaged angular correlation
functions wN for N = 2,...,7 from the third data release of the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS). The sample was selected from galaxies with 18 < r < 21, and
is the largest ever used to study higher-order correlations. The measured wN
are used to calculate the projected, sN, and real space, SN, hierarchical
amplitudes. This produces highly-precise measurements over 0.2 to 10 h-1 Mpc,
which are consistent with Gaussian primordial density fluctuations. The
measurements suggest that higher-order galaxy bias is non-negligible, as
defining b1 = 1 yields c2 = -0.24 +/- 0.08. We report the first SDSS
measurement of marginally significant third-order bias, c3 = 0.98 +/- 0.89,
which suggests that bias terms may be significant to even higher order.
Previous measurements of c2 have yielded inconsistent results. Inconsistencies
would be expected if different data sets sample different galaxy types,
especially if different galaxy types exhibit different higher-order bias. We
find early-type galaxies exhibit significantly different behavior than
late-types at both small and large scales. At large scales (r > 1 h-1 Mpc), we
find the SN for late-type galaxies are lower than for early-types, implying a

reddening and seeing. The latter introduces minor structure in wN.",2006-05-31T19:53:31Z
"Spitzer/MIPS Imaging of NGC 650: Probing the History of Mass Loss on the
  Asymptotic Giant Branch","We present the far-infrared (IR) maps of a bipolar planetary nebula (PN), NGC
650, at 24, 70, and 160 micron taken with the Multiband Imaging Photometer for
Spitzer (MIPS) on-board the Spitzer Space Telescope. While the two-peak
emission structure seen in all MIPS bands suggests the presence of a near
edge-on dusty torus, the distinct emission structure between the 24 micron map
and the 70/160 micron maps indicates the presence of two distinct emission
components in the central torus. Based on the spatial correlation of these two
far-IR emission components with respect to various optical line emission, we
conclude that the 24 micron emission is largely due to the [O IV] line at 25.9
micron arising from highly ionized regions behind the ionization front, whereas
the 70 and 160 micron emission is due to dust continuum arising from
low-temperature dust in the remnant asymptotic giant branch (AGB) wind shell.
The far-IR nebula structure also suggests that the enhancement of mass loss at
the end of the AGB phase has occurred isotropically, but has ensued only in the
equatorial directions while ceasing in the polar directions. The present data
also show evidence for the prolate spheroidal distribution of matter in this
bipolar PN. The AGB mass loss history reconstructed in this PN is thus
consistent with what has been previously proposed based on the past optical and
mid-IR imaging surveys of the post-AGB shells.",2006-06-21T19:58:21Z
"Oscillator Strengths and Predissociation Rates for Rydberg Transitions
  in 12C16O, 13C16O, and 13C18O Involving the E 1Pi, B 1Sigma+, and W 1Pi
  States","One of the processes controlling the interstellar CO abundance and the ratio
of its isotopologues is photodissociation. Accurate oscillator strengths and
predissociation rates for Rydberg transitions are needed for modeling this
process. We present results on absorption from the E ^1Pi-X ^1Sigma^+ (1-0) and
B ^1Sigma^+-X ^1Sigma^+ (6-0) bands at 1051 and 1002 \AA, respectively, and the
vibrational progression W ^1Pi-X ^1Sigma^+ (v'-0) bands with v' = 0 to 3 at
972, 956, 941, and 925 \AA, respectively. The corresponding spectra were
acquired at the high resolution (R ~ 30,000) SU5 beam line at the Super ACO
Synchrotron in Orsay, France. Spectra were obtained for the ^12C^16O, ^13C^16O,
and ^13C^18O isotopologues. These represent the most complete set of
measurements available. Comparison is made with earlier results, both empirical
and theoretical. While earlier determinations of oscillator strengths based on
absorption from synchrotron radiation tend to be somewhat smaller than ours,
the suite of measurements from a variety of techniques agree for the most part
considering the mutual uncertainties. For the bands studied here, their
relative weakness, or their significant line widths arising from
predissociation, minimizes potential problems from large optical depths at line
center in absorption measurements. Predissociating line widths could generally
be extracted from the spectra thanks to the profile simulations used in the
analysis. In many cases, these simulations allowed us to consider e and f
parity levels separately and to determine the dependence of the width on
rotational quantum number, J. Our results are consistent with earlier
determinations, especially the widths inferred from laser experiments.",2006-05-06T14:15:47Z
"Toward 1% Photometry: End-to-end Calibration of Astronomical Telescopes
  and Detectors","We review the systematic uncertainties that have plagued attempts to obtain
high precision and high accuracy from ground-based photometric measurements
using CCDs. We identify two main challenges in breaking through the 1%
precision barrier: 1) fully characterizing atmospheric transmission, along the
instrument's line of sight, and 2) properly identifying, measuring and removing
instrumental artifacts. We discuss approximations and limitations inherent in
the present methodology, and we estimate their contributions to systematic
photometric uncertainties. We propose an alternative conceptual scheme for the
relative calibration of astronomical apparatus: the availability of calibrated
detectors whose relative spectral sensitivity is known to better than one part
in $10^3$ opens up the possibility of in situ relative throughput measurements,
normalized to a precision calibrated detector, using a stable but uncalibrated
narrowband light source. An implementation scheme is outlined, which exploits
the availability of tunable lasers to map out the relative wavelength response
of an imaging system, using a flatfield screen and a calibrated reference
photodiode. The merits and limitations of this scheme are discussed. In tandem
with careful measurements of atmospheric transmission, this approach could
potentially lead to reliable ground-based photometry with fractional
uncertainties below the percent level.",2006-04-12T22:59:56Z
"Photometric survey of marginally investigated open clusters: I. Basel
  11b, King 14, Czernik 43","To progress in galactic studies based on open clusters, e.g. cluster
formation rate or kinematical properties, one needs to improve the number of
open clusters observed. However, only half of the 1700 known galactic open
clusters have been properly observed so far, making any statistical
investigation insignificant, especially at larger distances from the Sun. We
study marginally investigated or neglected open clusters with Bessell CCD BVR
photometry, whose data were used to fit isochrones to the individual
color-magnitude diagrams. We examined the galactic clusters Basel 11b, King 14
and Czernik 43, the last being observed for the first time to this extent. As
well as a careful comparison to available photometry, their parameters such as
age, interstellar reddening, distance and apparent diameter were determined.
The obtained cluster properties were verified by near infrared 2MASS data. The
three investigated intermediate age clusters are all located in the galactic
disk with distances between 1.8 and 3.0kpc from the Sun.",2006-04-12T10:33:35Z
The Ultraluminous X-ray Source in Holmberg IX and its Environment,"We present optical observations of an ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) in
Holmberg IX, a dwarf galaxy near M81. The ULX has an average X-ray luminosity
of some 10^{40} erg/s. It is located in a huge (400pc x 300pc) ionized nebula
being much larger than normal supernova remnants. From the observed emission
lines (widths and ratios) we find that the structure is due to collisional
excitation by shocks, rather than by photoionization.
  We identify the optical counterpart to be a 22.8 mag blue star (M_V=-5.0)
belonging to a small stellar cluster. From isochrone fitting of our
multi-colour photometry we determine a cluster age of 20 to 50 Myr. We also
discovered strong stellar HeII4686 emission (equivalent width of 10 A) which
proves the identification with the X-ray source, and which suggests the
presence of an X-ray heated accretion disc around the putative black hole.",2006-03-28T16:44:17Z
Cygnus A: A Long Wavelength Resolution of the Hot Spots,"This paper presents observations of Cygnus A at 74 and 327 MHz at angular
resolutions of approximately 10"" and 3"", respectively. These observations are
among the highest angular resolutions obtained below 1000 MHz for this object.
While the angular resolution at 74 MHz is not sufficient to separate clearly
the hot spots from the lobes, guided by 151 and 327 MHz images, we have
estimated the 74 MHz emission from the hot spots. We confirm that the emission
from both the western and eastern hot spots flattens at low frequencies and
that there is a spectral asymmetry between the two. For the eastern hot spot, a
low-energy cutoff in the electron energy spectrum appears to explain the
flattening, which implies a cutoff Lorentz factor \gamma_min ~ 300, though we
cannot exclude the possibility that there might be a moderate level of
free-free absorption. For the western hot spot, the current observations are
not sufficient to distinguish between a free-free absorped power-law spectrum
and a synchrotron self-absorbed spectrum.",2006-03-27T12:13:53Z
Implications of a Running Spectral Index for Slow Roll Inflation,"We analyze the weak (2 sigma) evidence for a running spectral index seen in
the three-year WMAP dataset and its implications for single field, slow roll
inflation. We assume that the running is comparable to the central value found
from the WMAP data analysis, and use the Hubble Slow Roll formalism to follow
the evolution of the slow roll parameters. For all parameter choices consistent
with a large, negative running, single field, slow roll inflation lasts less
than 30 efolds after CMB scales leave the horizon. Thus, a definitive
observation of a large negative running would imply that any inflationary phase
requires multiple fields or the breakdown of slow roll. Alternatively, if
single field, slow roll inflation is sources the primordial fluctuations, we
can expect the observed running to move much closer to zero as the CMB is
measured more accurately at small angular scales.",2006-04-10T20:00:04Z
Power-laws f(R) theories are cosmologically unacceptable,"In a recent paper [1] (PRL 98,131302,2007) we have shown that f(R)=R + mu
R^{n} modified gravity dark energy models are not cosmologically viable because
during the matter era that precedes the accelerated stage the cosmic expansion
is given by a sim t^{1/2} rather than a sim t^{2/3}, where a is a scale factor
and t is the cosmic time. A recent work [2] (PLB 639,135-143,2006) by
Capozziello et al. criticised our results presenting some apparent
counter-examples to our claim in f(R)= mu R^{n} models. We show here that those
particular R^{n} models can produce an expansion as a sim t^{2/3} but this does
not connect to a late-time acceleration. Hence, though acceptable f(R) dark
energy models may exist, the R^{n} models presented in Capozziello et al. are
not cosmologically viable, confirming our previous results in Ref. [1].",2006-05-16T10:39:05Z
Predicting the Starquakes in PSR J0537-6910,"We report on more than 7 years of monitoring of PSR J0537-6910, the 16 ms
pulsar in the Large Magellanic Cloud, using data acquired with the RXTE. During
this campaign the pulsar experienced 23 sudden increases in frequency
(``glitches'') amounting to a total gain of over six ppm of rotation frequency
superposed on its gradual spindown of d(nu)/d(t) = -2e-10 Hz/s. The time
interval from one glitch to the next obeys a strong linear correlation to the
amplitude of the first glitch, with a mean slope of about 400 days ppm (6.5
days per uHz), such that these intervals can be predicted to within a few days,
an accuracy which has never before been seen in any other pulsar. There appears
to be an upper limit of ~40 uHz for the size of glitches in_all_ pulsars, with
the 1999 April glitch of J0537 as the largest so far. The change in the
spindown of J0537 across the glitches, Delta(d(nu)/d(t)), appears to have the
same hard lower limit of -1.5e-13 Hz/s, as, again, that observed in all other
pulsars. The spindown continues to increase in the long term,
d(d(nu)/d(t))/d(t) = -1e-21 Hz/s/s, and thus the timing age of J0537 (-0.5 nu
d(nu)/d(t)) continues to decrease at a rate of nearly one year every year,
consistent with movement of its magnetic moment away from its rotational axis
by one radian every 10,000 years, or about one meter per year. J0537 was likely
to have been born as a nearly-aligned rotator spinning at 75-80 Hz, with a
|d(nu)/d(t)| considerably smaller than its current value of 2e-10 Hz/s. The
pulse profile of J0537 consists of a single pulse which is found to be flat at
its peak for at least 0.02 cycles.",2006-05-01T19:57:48Z
"Toward Understanding the origin of the Fundamental Plane for Early-Type
  Galaxies","We present a panoramic review of several observational and theoretical
aspects of the modern astrophysical research about the origin of the
Fundamental Plane (FP) relation for Early-Type Galaxies (ETGs). The discussion
is focused on the problem of the tilt and the tightness of the FP, and on the
attempts to derive the luminosity evolution of ETGs with redshift. Finally, a
number of observed features in the FP are interpreted from the standpoint of a
new theoretical approach based on the two-component tensor virial theorem.",2006-06-16T11:16:42Z
"Extremely alpha-Enriched Globular Clusters in Early-Type Galaxies: A
  Step towards the Dawn of Stellar Populations?","We compare [alpha/Fe], metallicity, and age distributions of globular
clusters in elliptical, lenticular, and spiral galaxies, which we derive from
Lick line index measurements. We find a large number of globular clusters in
elliptical galaxies that reach significantly higher [alpha/Fe] values (>0.5)
than any clusters in lenticular and spiral galaxies. Most of these extremely
alpha-enriched globular clusters are old (t > 8 Gyr) and cover the metallicity
range -1 <~ [Z/H] <~ 0. A comparison with supernova yield models suggests that
the progenitor gas clouds of these globular clusters must have been
predominantly enriched by massive stars (>~20 M_sol) with little contribution
from lower-mass stars. The measured [alpha/Fe] ratios are also consistent with
yields of very massive pair-instability supernovae (~130-190 M_sol). Both
scenarios imply that the chemical enrichment of the progenitor gas was
completed on extremely short timescales of the order of a few Myr. Given the
lower [alpha/Fe] average ratios of the diffuse stellar population in early-type
galaxies, our results suggest that these extremely alpha-enhanced globular
clusters could be members of the very first generation of star clusters formed,
and that their formation epochs would predate the formation of the majority of
stars in giant early-type galaxies.",2006-05-09T18:21:04Z
"The Feedback-Regulated Growth of Black Holes and Bulges through Gas
  Accretion and Starbursts in Cluster Central Dominant Galaxies","We present an analysis of the growth of black holes through accretion and
bulges through star formation in 33 galaxies at the centers of cooling flows.
Most of these systems show evidence of cavities in the intracluster medium
(ICM) inflated by radio jets emanating from their active galactic nuclei (AGN).
We present a new and extensive analysis of X-ray cavities in these systems. We
find that AGN are energetically able to balance radiative losses (cooling) from
the ICM in more than half of our sample. Using a subsample of 17 systems, we
examine the relationship between cooling and star formation. We find that the
star formation rates are approaching or are comparable to X-ray and far UV
limits on the rates of gas condensation onto the central galaxy. The remaining
radiative losses could be offset by AGN feedback. The vast gulf between
radiative losses and the sink of cooling material, which has been the primary
objection to cooling flows, has narrowed and, in some cases, is no longer a
serious issue. Using the cavity (jet) powers, we place strong lower limits on
the rate of growth of supermassive black holes in central galaxies, and we find
that they are growing at an average rate of ~ 0.1 solar masses per year, with
some systems growing as quickly as ~ 1 solar mass per year. We find a trend
between bulge growth (star formation) and black hole growth that is
approximately in accordance with the slope of the local (Magorrian) relation
between black hole and bulge mass. However, the large scatter in the trend
suggests that bulges and black holes do not always grow in lock step.

Synchrotron emission from the T Tauri binary system V773 Tau A,"The pre-main sequence binary system V773 Tau A shows remarkable flaring
activity around periastron passage. Here, we present the observation of such a
flare at a wavelength of 3 mm (90 GHz) performed with the Plateau de Bure
Interferometer. We examine different possible causes for the energy losses
responsible for the e-folding time of 2.3 hours of that flare. We exclude
synchrotron, collisional, and inverse Compton losses because they are not
consistent with observational constraints, and we propose that the fading of
the emission is due to the leakage of electrons themselves at each reflection
between the two mirror points of the magnetic structure partially trapping
them. The magnetic structure compatible with both our leakage model and
previous observations is that of a helmet streamer that, as in the solar case,
can occur at the top of the X-ray-emitting, stellar-sized coronal loops of one
of the stars. The streamer may extend up to 20 R and interact with the corona
of the other star at periastron passage, causing recurring flares. The inferred
magnetic field strength at the two mirror points of the helmet streamer is in
the range 0.12 - 125 G, and the corresponding Lorentz factor, gamma, of the
partially trapped electrons is in the range 20 < gamma < 632. We therefore rule
out that the emission could be of gyro-synchrotron nature: the derived high
Lorentz factor proves that the nature of the emission at 90 GHz from this
pre-main binary system is synchrotron radiation.

Interferometer. IRAM is supported by INSU/CNRS (France), MPG (Germany), and IGN
(Spain).",2006-04-06T08:46:39Z
"Galaxy surveys, inhomogeneous reionization, and dark energy","We examine the effect of inhomogeneous reionization on the galaxy power
spectrum and the consequences for probing dark energy. To model feedback during
reionization, we apply an ansatz setting the galaxy overdensity proportional to
the underlying ionization field. Thus, inhomogeneous reionization may leave an
imprint in the galaxy power spectrum. We evolve this imprint to low redshift
and use the Fisher-matrix formalism to assess the effect on parameter
estimation. We show that a combination of low- (z=0.3) and high- (z=3) redshift
galaxy surveys can constrain the size of cosmological HII regions during
reionization. This imprint can also cause confusion when using baryon
oscillations or other features of the galaxy power spectrum to probe the dark
energy. We show that when bubbles are large, and hence detectable, our ability
to constrain w can be degraded by up to 50%. When bubbles are small, the
imprint has little or no effect on measuring dark-energy parameters.",2006-04-18T17:01:33Z
"Mass-dependent Color Evolution of Field Galaxies Back to z~3 Over the
  Wide Range of Stellar Mass","We use deep multi-band optical and near-infrared data for four general
fields, GOODS-South, HDF North/South, and IRAC UDF in GOODS-North to
investigate the evolution of the observed rest-frame U-V color of field
galaxies as a function of the stellar mass. In these four fields, the U-V color
distributions of the galaxies at each mass and redshift interval are very
similar. At 0.3<z<2.7, we found that more massive galaxies always tend to have
a redder U-V color. High- and low-mass galaxies exhibit quite different color
evolutions. As seen in our previous study in HDF-N, the color distribution of
low-mass (M_stellar < 3x10^9M_solar) galaxies becomes significantly bluer with
an increase in the redshift. This evolution of the average color can be
explained by a constant star formation rate model with z_form~4. On the other
hand, the average color of high-mass galaxies (M_stellar > 3x10^10M_solar)
evolves more strongly at a high redshift. Such mass-dependent color
distribution and its evolution indicate that galaxies with a larger stellar
mass appear to have shorter star-formation timescales, and on an average, they
form the larger fraction of their stars in the earlier epoch.",2006-06-03T09:50:24Z
Gauss-Bonnet braneworld and WMAP three year results,"We compare predictions for the spectral index and tensor-scalar ratio in
models of patch inflation with the WMAP three year data. There are three cases
of these models of inflation, which arise in the Gauss-Bonnet braneworld
scenario: Gauss-Bonnet (GB), Randall-Sundrum (RS), and 4D general relativity
(GR). We consider the large-field potential $V \propto \phi^p$ in both
commutative and noncommutative spacetimes, and find that in the cases of the GB
and GR patch cosmologies, the quadratic potential is observationally favored,
while the quartic potential is ruled out in most patches. Strong noncommutative
inflation is excluded in all cases because it leads to a blue-tilted scalar
spectral index.",2006-05-27T18:53:26Z
"Spitzer observations of the Orion OB1 association: second generation
  dust disks at 5-10 Myr","We report new Spitzer observations of intermediate mass stars in two regions
of the Orion OB1 association located in the subassociations OB1a ($\sim$10 Myr)
and OB1b ($\sim$5 Myr). In a representative sample of stars earlier than F5 of
both stellar groups, we find a population of stars surrounded of debris disks,
without excess in the IRAC bands and without emission lines in their optical
spectra, but with a varying degree of 24{\micron} excess. Comparing our samples
with 24{\micron} observations of intermediate mass stars in other stellar
groups, spanning a range of ages from 2.5 Myr to 150 Myr, we find that debris
disks are more frequent and have larger 24{\micron} excess at 10 Myr (OB1a).
This trend agrees with predictions of models of evolution of solids in the
outer regions of disks ($>$30 AU), where large icy objects ($\sim$1000 Km)
begin to form at $\sim$10 Myr; the presence of these objects in the disk
initiates a collisional cascade, producing enough dust particles to explain the
relatively large 24 {\micron} excess observed in OB1a. The dust luminosity
observed in the stellar groups older than 10 Myr declines roughly as predicted
by collisional cascade models. Combining Spitzer observations, optical spectra
and 2MASS data, we found a new Herbig Ae/Be star (HD290543) and a star
(HD36444) with a large 24 {\micron} excess, both in OB1b. This last object
could be explained as a intermediate stage between HAeBe and true debris
systems or as a massive debris disk produced by a collision between two large
objects ($>$1000 Km).",2006-07-25T14:21:24Z
Diagnostics of SS433 with the RXTE,"We present analysis of extensive monitoring of SS433 by the RXTE observatory
collected over the period 1996-2005. The difference between energy spectra
taken at different precessional and orbital phases shows the presence of a
strong photoabsorption near the optical star, probably due to its powerful
dense wind. Assuming that a precessing accretion disk is thick, we recover the
temperature profile in the X-ray emitting jet that best fits the observed
precessional variations of the X-ray emission temperature. The hottest visible
part of the X-ray jet is located at a distance of $l_0/a\sim0.06-0.09$, or
$\sim2-3\times10^{11}$cm from the central compact object and has a temperature
of about $T_{\rm max}\sim30$ keV. We discovered appreciable orbital X-ray
eclipses at the ``crossover'' precessional phases (jets are in the plane of the
sky, disk is edge-on) which put a lower limit on the size of the optical
component $R/a\ga0.5$ and an upper limit on a mass ratio of binary companions
$q=M_{\rm x}/M_{\rm opt}\la0.3-0.35$. The size of the eclipsing region can be
larger than secondary's Roche lobe because of substantial photoabsorption by
dense stellar wind. This must be taken into account when evaluating the mass
ratio from analysis of X-ray eclipses.",2006-07-10T14:32:14Z
Evidence for variable outflows in the Young Stellar Object V645 Cygni,"As part of the Red MSX Source Survey of Massive Young Stellar Objects (MYSOs)
we have conducted multi-wavelength follow up observations of the well-known
object V645 Cygni. We present our data on this object, whose near-infrared
spectrum is exceptional and place these in context with previous observations.
Our observations of V645 Cyg included near/mid infrared imaging observations,
13CO 2-1 line observations and high signal-to-noise velocity resolved
near-infrared spectroscopy. The spectrum shows P-Cygni hydrogen Brackett
emission, consistent with a high velocity stellar wind. A red-shifted emission
component to a number of near-IR emission lines was also uncovered. This is
associated with a similar component in the H alpha line. V645 Cyg is also found
to have variable CO first overtone bandhead emission. The data clearly indicate
that the outflow of V645 Cyg is variable. The unidentified feature in a
previously published optical spectrum is identified with a receding outflow at
2000 km per second. The nature of this feature, which is found in hydrogen and
helium atomic lines and CO molecular lines remains a puzzle.",2006-06-27T12:44:30Z

"An Example of the Quasiperiodic Solution of the Restricted Three Body
  Problem at 2:1 Resonance","The 2:1 mean motion resonance orbit was integrated at the restricted planar
3-body problem in absolute frame. Orbit of Jupiter was assumed circular.
Initial Jupiter longitude was assumed zero. The Runge-Kutta method was used.
The start of first series of integration was from conjunction point at zero
inclination and fixed eccentricity e=0.4 and different pericenter longitudes.
  The orbit with encounter at apocenter shows fast clockwise rotation. The
orbit with encounter at pericenter rotated counterclockwise. It means, that
periodic orbit exist between two investigated ones. It was found, that two
orbits with e=0.4, initial perihelion longitude close to 100o has not apsidal
line rotation; however it has significant semimajor axis variations. The
orbital elements show a very regular behavior on time interval about 3000
years. Due to Laplace theorem, at low perturbation, semimajor axis has only
small short periodic oscillations. It means, that motion may be exactly
periodic. The cases of another initial eccentricity are considered at range
from circular orbit to intersecting orbit. The dependence pericenter longitude
of quasi-periodic orbits on eccentricity was found. The orbits with e large 0.5
have catastrophic close encounters with Jupiter and may be periodic only at
special value of eccentricity. The additional series of integrations, at small

"Neutrinos from galactic sources of cosmic rays with known gamma-ray

the observed gamma-ray spectra of galactic cosmic ray sources that are
transparent to their gamma radiation. We evaluate in this way the neutrino flux
from the supernova remnant RX J1713.7-3946, whose very high-energy gamma-ray
spectrum (assumed to be of hadronic origin) is not a power law distribution
according to H.E.S.S. observations. The corresponding muon signal in neutrino
telescopes is found to be about 5 events per square kilometer per year in an

Observational constraints on phantom-like braneworld cosmologies,"We investigate a simple braneworld model in which the universe contains only
cold dark matter and a cosmological constant, but the effective dark energy is
phantom-like because of extra-dimensional gravity effects. Modified gravity
screens the cosmological constant Lambda, allowing for a larger Lambda. In
practice, observations do not favour any significant screening. We use
supernova data, the cosmic microwave background shift parameter, and the baryon
oscillation peak in the galaxy distribution to constrain the model. We find the
mean value of Omega_m with 68% confidence limits, and an upper limit on
Omega_Lambda at the 68% confidence level. The best-fit model is very close to a
standard LCDM model, but the LCDM model provides a better fit since it has one
less parameter.",2006-05-29T15:55:10Z
The Dissipative Merger Progenitors of Elliptical Galaxies,"We address the deviations of the scaling relations of elliptical galaxies
from the expectations based on the virial theorem and homology, including the
""tilt"" of the ""fundamental plane"" and the steep decline of density with mass.
We show that such tilts result from dissipative major mergers once the gas
fraction available for dissipation declines with progenitor mass, and derive
the scaling properties of the progenitors. We use hydrodynamical simulations to
quantify the effects of major mergers with different gas fractions on the
structural properties of galaxies. The tilts are driven by the differential
shrinkage of the effective stellar radius as a function of dissipation in the
merger, while the correlated smaller enhancements in internal velocity and
stellar mass keep the slope of the velocity-stellar mass relation near V \pr
M_*^{1/4}. The progenitors match a straightforward model of disc formation in
LCDM haloes. Their total to stellar mass ratio within the effective radius
varies as M/M_* \pr M_*^-0.25, consistent with supernova feedback. They are
nearly homologous in the sense that the dark-matter fractions within the
effective and virial radii scale with mass in a similar way, with only a weak
decline of density with mass. The progenitor radius is roughly R \pr M_*^0.3,
compatible with today's intermediate late-type galaxies. This indicates that
the latest wet mergers involved relatively big discs. The dissipative gas to
stellar mass ratio is predicted to decline \pr M_*^-0.5, similar to the
observed trend in today's blue sequence galaxies. Such a trend should be
observed in relatively massive gaseous galaxies at z~1-4. The corresponding
""baryonic"" relations are consistent with homology and spherical virial
equilibrium, V \pr R \pr M_b^1/3.",2006-03-20T15:11:08Z
Current Status Of Velocity Field Surveys: A Consistency Check,"We present an analysis comparing the bulk--flow measurements for six recent

estimates are consistent with each other and construct the full three
dimensional bulk--flow vectors for each survey. We show that although the
surveys differ in their geometry, galaxy morphologies, distance measures and
measurement errors, their bulk flow vectors are expected to be highly
correlated and in fact show impressive agreement in all cases. We found a
combined weighted mean bulk motion of 330 km s$^{-1}$ $\pm 101$ km s$^{-1}$
toward $l= 234^{\degree}\pm 11^{\degree}$ and $b=12^{\degree}\pm 9^{\degree}$
in a sphere with an effective depth of $\sim4000$ km s$^{-1}$.",2006-07-18T20:12:28Z
On the metallicity dependence of HMXBs,"It is commonly assumed that high mass X-ray binary (HMXB) populations are
little-affected by metallicity. However, the massive stars making up their
progenitor systems depend on metallicity in a number of ways, not least through
their winds. We present simulations, well-matched to the observed sample of
Galactic HMXBs, which demonstrate that both the number and the mean period of
HMXB progenitors can vary with metallicity, with the number increasing by about
a factor of three between solar and SMC metallicity. However, the SMC
population itself cannot be explained simply by metallicity effects; it
requires both that the HMXBs observed therein primarily sample the older end of
the HMXB population, and that the star formation rate at the time of their
formation was very large.",2006-06-08T16:55:18Z
"Small Magellanic Cloud Be stars: colour-magnitude relations and
  mass-loss","We present an analysis of optical lightcurves of Small Magellanic Cloud
Be-type stars. Observations show that (1) optical excess flux is correlated
with near-IR excess flux indicating a similar mechanism and (2) the lightcurves
can trace out ``loops'' in a colour-magnitude diagram. A simple model for the
time dependent bound-free and free-free emission produced by an outflowing
circumstellar disk gives reasonable fits to the observations.",2006-06-13T14:08:58Z
"Newly arising problems in the research of SU UMa-type dwarf novae from
  VSNET collaborations","Our research on variable objects based on the VSNET collaborations has
achieved much progress in understanding the nature of many kinds of phenomena.
Many problems have appeared, instead. Among them, we here review three newly
arising problems in the research of SU UMa-type dwarf novae: 1) how do EI Psc
and V485 Cen evolve as a cataclysmic variable?, 2) is the early superhump a
particular phenomenon for WZ Sge-type dwarf novae?, and 3) what parameters
determine variations of the superhump period?",2006-05-10T02:57:53Z
"Density-Functional-Theory Calculations of Matter in Strong Magnetic
  Fields: II. Infinite Chains and Condensed Matter","We present new, ab initio calculations of the electronic structure of
one-dimensional infinite chains and three-dimensional condensed matter in
strong magnetic fields ranging from B=10^12 G to 2x10^15 G, appropriate for
observed magnetic neutron stars. At these field strengths, the magnetic forces
on the electrons dominate over the Coulomb forces, and to a good approximation
the electrons are confined to the ground Landau level. Our calculations are
based on the density functional theory, and use a local magnetic
exchange-correlation function appropriate in the strong field regime. The band
structures of electrons in different Landau orbitals are computed
self-consistently. Numerical results of the ground-state energies and electron
work functions are given for one-dimensional chains of H, He, C, and Fe.
Fitting formulae for the B-dependence of the energies are also provided. For
all the field strengths considered in this paper, hydrogen, helium, and carbon
chains are found to be bound relative to individual atoms (although for B less
than a few x 10^12 G, the relative binding between C and C_infinity is small).
Iron chains are significantly bound for B>10^14 G and are weakly bound if at
all at B<10^13 G. We also study the cohesive property of three-dimensional
condensed matter of H, He, C, and Fe at zero pressure, constructed from
interacting chains in a body-centered tetragonal lattice. Such
three-dimensional condensed matter is found to be bound relative to individual
atoms, with the cohesive energy increasing rapidly with increasing B.",2006-07-12T21:11:57Z
"New Chandra observations of the jet in 3C273. I. Softer X-ray than radio
  spectra and the X-ray emission mechanism","The jet in 3C273 is a high-power quasar jet with radio, optical and X-ray
emission whose size and brightness allow a detailed study of the emission
processes acting in it. We present deep Chandra observations of this jet and
analyse the spectral properties of the jet emission from radio through X-rays.
We find that the X-ray spectra are significantly softer than the radio spectra
in all regions of the bright part of the jet except for the first bright ""knot
A"", ruling out a model in which the X-ray emission from the entire jet arises
from beamed inverse-Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons
in a single-zone jet flow. Within two-zone jet models, we find that a
synchrotron origin for the jet's X-rays requires fewer additional assumptions
than an inverse-Compton model, especially if velocity shear leads to efficient
particle acceleration in jet flows.",2006-05-20T18:00:02Z
"Towards Determination of the Initial Flavor Composition of
  Ultrahigh-energy Neutrino Fluxes with Neutrino Telescopes","We propose a simple but useful parametrization of the flavor composition of
ultrahigh-energy neutrino fluxes produced from distant astrophysical sources:
$\phi^{}_e : \phi^{}_\mu : \phi^{}_\tau = \sin^2 \xi \cos^2 \zeta : \cos^2 \xi
\cos^2 \zeta : \sin^2 \zeta$. We show that it is possible to determine or
constrain $\xi$ and $\zeta$ by observing two independent neutrino flux ratios
at the second-generation neutrino telescopes, provided three neutrino mixing
angles and the Dirac CP-violating phase have been well measured in neutrino
oscillations. Any deviation of $\zeta$ from zero will signify the existence of
cosmic $\nu^{}_\tau$ and $\bar{\nu}^{}_\tau$ neutrinos at the source, and an
accurate value of $\xi$ can be used to test both the conventional mechanism and
the postulated scenarios for cosmic neutrino production.",2006-03-29T03:34:11Z
Relic gravitational waves and their detection,"As the strong evidence for inflation, the relic gravitational waves (RGW)
have been extensively studied. Although, it has not been detected, yet some
constraints have been achieved by the observations. Future experiments for the
RGW detection are mainly two kinds: the CMB experiments and the laser
interferometers. In this paper, we study these current constraints and the
detective abilities of future experiments. We calculate the strength of RGW
$\Omega_g(k)$ in two methods: the analytic method and the numerical method by
solving the inflationary flow equations. By the first method we obtain a bound
$\Omega_g<3.89\times10^{-16}$ at $\nu=0.1$Hz, where we have used the current
constraints on the scalar spectral index, the tensor-scalar ratio, furthermore,
we have taken into account of the redshift-suppression effect, the accelerating
expansion effect, the neutrino damping effect on the RGW. But the analytic
expression of $\Omega_g(k)$ depends on the specific inflationary models and not
well applies for the waves with very high frequencies. The numerical method is
more precise for the waves with high frequencies and applies to any
single-field inflationary model. It gives a bound
$\Omega_g<8.62\times10^{-14}$, which is independent of the inflationary
parameters, and applies to any single-field slow-roll inflationary model. After
considering the current constraints on the inflationary parameters, this bound
becomes $\Omega_g<2\times10^{-17}$ (see text).",2006-04-21T06:22:46Z
"Dynamics of the NGC 4636 Globular Cluster System - An extremely dark
  matter dominated galaxy?","We present the first dynamical study of the globular cluster system of NGC
4636. This giant elliptical galaxy is claimed to be extremely dark matter
dominated, according to X-ray observations. Using the VLT with FORS2/MXU, we
obtained velocities for 174 globular clusters. The clusters have projected
galactocentric distances in the range 4 to 70 kpc, the overwhelming majority
lie within 30 kpc. We find some indication for a rotation of the red
(metal-rich) clusters about the minor axis. Out to a radius of 30 kpc, we find
a roughly constant projected velocity dispersion for the blue clusters of ~200
km/s. The red clusters exhibit a distinctly different behavior: at a radius of
about 13 kpc, the velocity dispersion drops by ~50 km/s to about 170 km/s which
then remains constant out to a radius of 30 kpc.
  Using only the blue clusters as dynamical tracers, we perform Jeans-analyses
for different assumptions of the orbital anisotropy. Depending on the
anisotropy and the adopted M/L-values, we find that the dark matter fraction
within one effective radius can vary between 20% and 50% with most a probable
range between 20% and 30%. A main source of uncertainty is the ambiguity of the
velocity dispersion in the outermost bin.
  Although the dark halo mass still cannot be strongly constrained, NGC 4636
does not seem to be extremely dark matter dominated. The derived circular
velocities are also consistent with Modified Newtonian Dynamics.",2006-04-13T17:35:57Z
The Metal-Strong Damped Lyman-alpha Systems,"We have identified a metal-strong (logN(Zn+) > 13.15 or logN(Si+) > 15.95)
DLA (MSDLA) population from an automated quasar (QSO) absorber search in the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 3 (SDSS-DR3) quasar sample, and find that
MSDLAs comprise ~5% of the entire DLA population with z_abs > 2.2 found in QSO
sightlines with r < 19.5. We have also acquired 27 Keck ESI follow-up spectra
of metal-strong candidates to evaluate our automated technique and examine the
MSDLA candidates at higher resolution. We demonstrate that the rest equivalent
widths of strong ZnII 2026 and SiII 1808 lines in low-resolution SDSS spectra
are accurate metal-strong indicators for higher-resolution spectra, and predict
the observed equivalent widths and signal-to-noise ratios needed to detect
certain extremely weak lines with high-resolution instruments. We investigate
how the MSDLAs may affect previous studies concerning a dust-obscuration bias
and the N(HI)-weighted cosmic mean metallicity <Z(z)>. Finally, we include a
brief discussion of abundance ratios in our ESI sample and find that underlying
mostly Type II supernovae enrichment are differential depletion effects due to
dust (and in a few cases quite strong); we present here a handful of new Ti and
Mn measurements, both of which are useful probes of depletion in DLAs. Future
papers will present detailed examinations of particularly metal-strong DLAs
from high-resolution KeckI/HIRES and VLT/UVES spectra.",2006-07-18T21:15:33Z
"On the Early Time X-ray Spectra of Swift Afterglows I: Evidence for
  Anomalous Soft X-ray Emission","We have conducted a thorough and blind search for emission lines in >70 Swift
X-ray afterglows of total exposure ~10^7s. We find that most afterglows are
consistent with pure power-laws plus extinction. Significant outliers to the
population exist at the 5-10% level and have anomalously soft, possibly thermal
spectra. Four bursts are singled out via possible detections of 2-5 lines: GRBs
060218, 060202, 050822, and 050714B. Alternatively, a blackbody model with
kT~0.1-0.5 keV can describe the soft emission in each afterglow. The most
significant soft component detections in the full data set of ~2000 spectra
correspond to GRB060218/SN2006aj, with line significances ranging up to
\~20-sigma. A thermal plasma model fit to the data indicates that the flux is
primarily due to L-shell transitions of Fe at ~ solar abundance. We associate
(>4-sigma significant) line triggers in the 3 other events with K-shell
transitions in light metals. We favor a model where the possible line emission
in these afterglows arises from the mildly relativistic cocoon of matter
surrounding the GRB jet as it penetrates and exits the surface of the
progenitor star. The emitting material in each burst is at a similar distance
\~10^12--10^13 cm, a similar density ~10^17 cm^-3, and subject to a similar
flux of ionizing radiation. The lines may correlate with the X-ray flaring. For
the blackbody interpretation, the soft flux may arise from break out of the GRB
shock or plasma cocoon from the progenitor stellar wind, as recently suggested
for GRB060218 (Campana et al. 2006). Due to the low z of GRB060218, bursts
faint in Gamma-rays with fluxes dominated by this soft X-ray component could
outnumber classical GRBs 100-1.",2006-04-04T21:58:00Z
3D MHD Simulations of Laboratory Plasma Jets,"Jets and outflows are thought to be an integral part of accretion phenomena
and are associated with a large variety of objects. In these systems, the
interaction of magnetic fields with an accretion disk and/or a magnetized
central object is thought to be responsible for the acceleration and
collimation of plasma into jets and wider angle flows. In this paper we present
three-dimensional MHD simulations of magnetically driven, radiatively cooled
laboratory jets that are produced on the MAGPIE experimental facility. The
general outflow structure comprises an expanding magnetic cavity which is
collimated by the pressure of an extended plasma background medium, and a
magnetically confined jet which develops within the magnetic cavity. Although
this structure is intrinsically transient and instabilities in the jet and
disruption of the magnetic cavity ultimately lead to its break-up, a well
collimated, knotty jet still emerges from the system; such clumpy morphology is
reminiscent of that observed in many astrophysical jets. The possible
introduction in the experiments of angular momentum and axial magnetic field
will also be discussed.",2006-06-30T13:37:39Z
"The First DIRECT Distance Determination to a Detached Eclipsing Binary
  in M33","We present the first direct distance determination to a detached eclipsing
binary in M33, which was found by the DIRECT Project. Located in the OB 66
association at coordinates (alpha, delta)=(01:33:46.17,+30:44:39.9) for
J2000.0, it was one of the most suitable detached eclipsing binaries found by
DIRECT for distance determination, given its apparent magnitude and orbital
period. We obtained follow-up BV time series photometry, JHKs photometry and
optical spectroscopy from which we determined the parameters of the system. It
contains two O7 main sequence stars with masses of 33.4+/-3.5 Mo and 30.0+/-3.3
Mo and radii of 12.3+/-0.4 Ro and 8.8+/-0.3 Ro, respectively. We derive
temperatures of 37000+/-1500 K and 35600+/-1500 K. Using BVRJHKs photometry for
the flux calibration, we obtain a distance modulus of 24.92+/-0.12 mag
(964+/-54 kpc), which is ~0.3 mag longer than the Key Project distance to M33.
We discuss the implications of our result and the importance of establishing
M33 as an independent rung on the cosmological distance ladder.",2006-06-12T20:17:59Z
Lyman Alpha Constraints on Very Low Luminosity AGN,"Recent surveys have detected Lya emission from z=4.5-6.5 at luminosities as
low as 10^41 erg/s. There is good evidence that low numbers of AGN are among
observed faint Lya emitters. Combining these observations with an empirical
relation between the intrinsic Lya and B-band luminosities of AGN, we obtain an
upper limit on the number density of AGN with absolute magnitudes M_B=[-16,-19]
at z=4.5-6.5. These AGN are up to two orders of magnitude fainter than those
discovered in the Chandra Deep Field, resulting in the faintest observational
constraints to date at these redshifts. At z=4.5, the powerlaw slope of the
very faint end of the luminosity function of AGN is shallower than the slope
observed at lower redshifts, beta <1.6, at the 98% confidence level. In fact,
we find marginal evidence that the luminosity function rises with luminosity,
corresponding to a powerlaw slope beta <0, at magnitudes fainter than M_B~-20
(75% confidence level). These results suggest either that accretion onto lower
mass black holes is less efficient than onto their more massive counterparts,
or that the number of black holes powering AGN with M_B >-20 is lower than
expected from the M_BH-sigma relation by one-two orders of magnitude.
Extrapolating from reverberation-mapping studies suggests that these black
holes would have M_BH=10^6-10^7 Msun. To facilitate the identification of AGN
among observed Lya emitters, we derive observational properties of faint AGN in
the Lya line, as well as in the X-ray and optical bands.",2006-06-14T01:14:06Z
Cosmological science enabled by Planck,"Planck will be the first mission to map the entire cosmic microwave
background (CMB) sky with mJy sensitivity and resolution better than 10'. The
science enabled by such a mission spans many areas of astrophysics and
cosmology. In particular it will lead to a revolution in our understanding of
primary and secondary CMB anisotropies, the constraints on many key
cosmological parameters will be improved by almost an order of magnitude (to
sub-percent levels) and the shape and amplitude of the mass power spectrum at
high redshift will be tightly constrained.",2006-06-27T00:13:20Z
"On the luminosity-redshift relation in brane-worlds with cosmological
  constant","In this paper we calculate the luminosity distance - redshift relation for a
special type of flat Friedmann brane with cosmological constant. This special
case is singled out by its simplicity, the luminosity distance being given in
terms of elementary functions. We compare our analytical result with the
expresssion of the luminosity distance for the flat
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe and discuss the
differences.",2006-06-27T18:20:40Z
"The Nature of Interstellar Gas toward the Pleiades Revealed in
  Absorption Lines","We present high-resolution, high signal to noise absorption-line observations
of CN, Ca II, Ca I, CH^+, and CH along twenty lines of sight toward members of
the Pleiades. The acquired data enable the most detailed study to date of the
interaction between cluster stars and the surrounding interstellar gas. Total
equivalent widths are consistent with previous investigations except where
weaker features are detected owing to our greater sensitivity. Mean b-values
for the molecular species indicate that toward most of the Pleiades CH is
associated with the production of CH^+ rather than CN. An analysis of radial
velocities reveals a kinematic distinction between ionized atomic gas and
molecular and neutral gas. Molecular components are found with velocities in
the local standard of rest of either ~ +7 km s^-1 or ~ +9.5 km s^-1, with the
higher-velocity components associated with the strongest absorption. Atomic gas
traced by Ca II shows a strong central component at v_LSR ~ +7 km s^-1
exhibiting velocity gradients indicative of cloud-cluster interactions. Gas
density estimates derived from measured CH/CH^+ column density ratios show good
agreement with those inferred from H_2 rotational populations, yielding typical
values of n ~ 50 cm^-3. Our models do not include the important time-dependent
effects on CH^+ formation which may ultimately be needed to extract physical
conditions in these clouds.",2006-06-27T15:11:51Z
"The Fluorescence Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory - A
  Calorimeter for UHECR","The Pierre Auger Observatory is a hybrid detector for ultrahigh energy cosmic
rays (UHECR) with energies above 10$^{18.5}$ eV. Currently the first part of
the Observatory nears completion in the southern hemisphere in Argentina. One
detection technique uses over 1600 water Cherenkov tanks at ground where
samples of secondary particles of extensive air showers (EAS) are detected. The
second technique is a calorimetric measurement of the energy deposited by EAS
in the atmosphere. Charged secondary particles of EAS lose part of their energy
in the atmosphere via ionization. The deposited energy is converted into
excitation of molecules of the air and afterwards partly emitted as
fluorescence light mainly from nitrogen in the wavelength region between 300
and 400 nm. This light is observed with 24 fluorescence telescopes in 4
stations placed at the boundary of the surface array. This setup provides a
combined measurement of the longitudinal shower development and the lateral
particle distribution at ground of the same event. Details on the fluorescence
technique and the necessary atmospheric monitoring will be presented, as well
as first physics results on UHECR.",2006-08-03T08:21:19Z
Age distribution of young clusters and field stars in the SMC,"In this paper we discuss the cluster and field star formation in the central
part of the Small Magellanic Cloud. The main goal is to study the correlation
between young objects and their interstellar environment. The ages of about 164
associations and 311 clusters younger than 1 Gyr are determined using isochrone
fitting. The spatial distribution of the clusters is compared with the HI maps,
with the HI velocity dispersion field, with the location of the CO clouds and
with the distribution of young field stars. The cluster age distribution
supports the idea that clusters formed in the last 1 Gyr of the SMC history in
a roughly continuous way with periods of enhancements. The two super-shells 37A
and 304A detected in the HI distribution are clearly visible in the age
distribution of the clusters: an enhancement in the cluster formation rate has
taken place from the epoch of the shell formation. A tight correlation between
young clusters and the HI intensity is found. The degree of correlation is
decreasing with the age of the clusters. Clusters older than 300 Myr are
located away from the HI peaks. Clusters and associations younger than 10 Myr
are related to the CO clouds in the SW region of the SMC disk. A positive
correlation between the location of the young clusters and the velocity
dispersion field of the atomic gas is derived only for the shell 304A,
suggesting that the cloud-cloud collision is probably not the most important
mechanism of cluster formation. Evidence of gravitational triggered episode due
to the most recent close interaction between SMC and LMC is found both in the
cluster and field star distribution.",2006-04-07T14:56:56Z
"Eclipsing binaries observed with the WIRE satellite I. Discovery and
  photometric analysis of the new bright A0IV eclipsing binary Psi Centauri","Determinations of stellar mass and radius with realistic uncertainties at the
level of 1% provide important constraints on models of stellar structure and
evolution. We present a high-precision light curve of the A0IV star Psi
Centauri, from the star tracker on board the WIRE satellite and the Solar Mass
Ejection Imager camera on the Coriolis spacecraft. The data show that Psi Cen
is an eccentric eclipsing binary system with a relatively long orbital period.
The WIRE light curve extends over 28.7 nights and contains 41334 observations
with 2 mmag point-to-point scatter. The eclipse depths are 0.28 and 0.16 mag,
and show that the two eclipsing components of Psi Cen have very different
radii. As a consequence, the secondary eclipse is total. We find the
eccentricity to be e=0.55 with an orbital period of 38.8 days from combining
the WIRE light curve with data taken over two years from the Solar Mass
Ejection Imager camera. We have fitted the light curve with EBOP and have
assessed the uncertainties of the resulting parameters using Monte Carlo
simulations. The fractional radii of the stars and the inclination of the orbit
have random errors of only 0.1% and 0.01 degrees, respectively, but the
systematic uncertainty in these quantities may be somewhat larger. We have used
photometric calibrations to estimate the effective temperatures of the
components of Psi Cen to be 10450+-300 and 8800+-300 K, indicating masses of
about 3.1 and 2.0 Msun. There is evidence in the WIRE light curve for g-mode
pulsations in the primary star.",2006-06-22T09:23:03Z
"The effect of FIR emission from SDSS galaxies on the SFD Galactic
  extinction map","We compare the most successful and widely used map of Galactic dust
extinction, provided by Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis (1998; hereafter SFD), to
the galaxy number counts in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
photometric/spectroscopic DR4 sample. We divide the SDSS survey area into 69
disjoint subregions according to the dust extinction provided by SFD and
compare the surface number density of galaxies in each subregion. As expected,
the galaxy surface number density decreases with increasing extinction but only
for SFD extinction values above about 0.1 to 0.2 magnitudes (depending on the
band). At lower values of the SFD extinction, we find that the sky surface
density of galaxies increases with increasing extinction, precisely the
opposite of the effect expected from Galactic dust. We suggest that the far
infrared (FIR) brightness of the sky in regions of true low dust extinction is
significantly ``contaminated'' by the FIR emission from background galaxies. We
show that such an explanation is both qualitatively and quantitatively
consistent with the available data. Based on this interpretation we conclude
that systematic errors in the SFD extinction map due to extragalactic FIR
emission are quite small, of order hundredths of a magnitude, but nevertheless
statistically detectable. (Abridged)",2006-07-06T08:31:43Z
"Attempts to measure the magnetic field of the pulsating B star $ν$
  Eridani","We report on attempts to measure the magnetic field of the pulsating B star
$\nu$ Eridani with the Musicos spectropolarimeter attached to the 2m telescope
at the Pic du Midi, France. This object is one of the most extensively studied
stars for pulsation modes, and the existence of a magnetic field was suggested
from the inequality of the frequency separations of a triplet in the stars'
oscillation spectrum. We show that the inferred 5-10 kG field was not present
during our observations, which cover about one year. We discuss the influence
of the strong pulsations on the analysis of the magnetic field strength and set
an upper limit to the effective longitudinal field strength and to the field
strength for a dipolar configuration. We also find that the observed wind line
variability is caused by the pulsations.",2006-03-13T14:53:39Z
"Clustering of K-selected Galaxies at 2<z<3.5: Evidence for a
  Color-Density Relation","We study the clustering properties of K-selected galaxies at 2<z<3.5 using
deep multiwavelength imaging in three fields from the MUSYC survey. These are
the first measurements to probe the spatial correlation function of K-selected
galaxies in this redshift range on large scales, allowing for robust
conclusions about the dark matter halos that host these galaxies. K-selected
galaxies with K<21 have a correlation length r_0 ~ 6 h^-1 Mpc, larger than
typical values found for optically-selected galaxies. The correlation length
does not depend on K-band magnitude, but it does increase strongly with color;
the J-K>2.3 distant red galaxies (DRGs) have r_0 ~ 11 h^-1 Mpc. Contrary to
findings for optically-selected galaxies, K-selected galaxies that are faint in
the R-band cluster more strongly than brighter galaxies. These results suggest
that a color-density relation was in place at z>2. Our results indicate that
K-bright blue galaxies and K-bright red galaxies are fundamentally different,
as they have different clustering properties. Using a simple model of one
galaxy per halo, we infer halo masses ~ 5 x 10^12 M_sun for K<21 galaxies and ~
2 x 10^13 M_sun for DRGs. A comparison of the observed space density of DRGs to
the density of their host halos suggests large halo occupation numbers;
however, this result is at odds with the lack of a strong small-scale excess in
the angular correlation function. We find that the z=0 descendants of the
galaxies considered here reside primarily in groups and clusters. [abridged]",2006-06-14T19:16:10Z
"The Hubble Constant from Type Ia Supernova Calibrated with the Linear
  and Non-Linear Cepheid Period-Luminosity Relation","It is well-known that the peak brightness of the Type Ia supernovae
calibrated with Cepheid distances can be used to determine the Hubble constant.
The Cepheid distances to host galaxies of the calibrating supernovae are
usually obtained using the period-luminosity (PL) relation derived from Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) Cepheids. However recent empirical studies provide
evidence that the LMC PL relation is not linear. In this Letter we determine
the Hubble constant using both the linear and non-linear LMC Cepheid PL
relations as calibrating relations to four galaxies that hosted Type Ia
supernovae. Our results suggest that the obtained values of the Hubble constant
are similar. However a typical error of $\sim0.03$mag. has to be added (in
quadrature) to the systematic error for the Hubble constant when the linear LMC
PL relation is used, assuming that the LMC PL relation is indeed non-linear.
This is important in minimizing the total error of the Hubble constant in the
era of precision cosmology. The Hubble constants calibrated from the linear and
non-linear LMC PL relation are H_0 = 74.92+-2.28(random)+-5.06(systematic)
km/s/Mpc and H_0 = 74.37+-2.27(random)+-4.92(systematic) km/s/Mpc,
respectively. Hubble constants calculated using the Galactic PL relations are
also briefly discussed and presented in the last section of this Letter.",2006-03-23T16:22:46Z
Studies of Neutron Stars at Optical/IR Wavelengths,"In the last years, optical studies of Isolated Neutron Stars (INSs) have
expanded from the more classical rotation-powered ones to other categories,
like the Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs) and the Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters
(SGRs), which make up the class of the magnetars, the radio-quiet INSs with
X-ray thermal emission and, more recently, the enigmatic Compact Central
Objects (CCOs) in supernova remnants. Apart from 10 rotation-powered pulsars,
so far optical/IR counterparts have been found for 5 magnetars and for 4 INSs.
In this work we present some of the latest observational results obtained from
optical/IR observations of different types of INSs.",2006-08-01T17:28:46Z
"Theory for the Secondary Eclipse Fluxes, Spectra, Atmospheres, and Light
  Curves of Transiting Extrasolar Giant Planets","We have created a general methodology for calculating the
wavelength-dependent light curves of close-in extrasolar giant planets (EGPs)
as they traverse their orbits. Focussing on the transiting EGPs HD189733b,
TrES-1, and HD209458b, we calculate planet/star flux ratios during secondary
eclipse and compare them with the Spitzer data points obtained so far in the
mid-infrared. We introduce a simple parametrization for the redistribution of
heat to the planet's nightside, derive constraints on this parameter (P_n), and
provide a general set of predictions for planet/star contrast ratios as a
function of wavelength, model, and phase. Moreover, we calculate average
dayside and nightside atmospheric temperature/pressure profiles for each
transiting planet/P_n pair with which existing and anticipated Spitzer data can
be used to probe the atmospheric thermal structure of severely irradiated EGPs.
We find that the baseline models do a good job of fitting the current secondary
eclipse dataset, but that the Spitzer error bars are not yet small enough to
discriminate cleanly between all the various possibilities.",2006-07-02T21:28:36Z
The blue stragglers formed via mass transfer in old open clusters,"In this paper, we present the simulations for the primordial blue stragglers
in the old open cluster M67 based on detailed modelling of the evolutionary
processes. The principal aim is to discuss the contribution of mass transfer
between the components of close binaries to the blue straggler population in
M67. First, we followed the evolution of a binary of 1.4M$_\odot$+0.9M$_\odot$.
The synthetic evolutionary track of the binary system revealed that a
primordial blue straggler had a long lifetime in the observed blue straggler
region of color-magnitude diagram. Second, a grid of models for close binary
systems experiencing mass exchange were computed from 1Gyr to 6Gyr in order to
account for primordial blue-straggler formation in a time sequence. Based on
such a grid, Monte-Carlo simulations were applied for the old open cluster M67.
Adopting appropriate orbital parameters, 4 primordial blue stragglers were
predicted by our simulations. This was consistent with the observational fact
that only a few blue stragglers in M67 were binaries with short orbital
periods. An upper boundary of the primordial blue stragglers in the
color-magnitude diagram (CMD) was defined and could be used to distinguish blue
stragglers that were not formed via mass exchange. Using the grid of binary
models, the orbital periods of the primordial BSs could be predicted. Compared
with the observations, it is clear that the mechanism discussed in this work
alone cannot fully predict the blue straggler population in M67. There must be
several other processes also involved in the formation of the observed blue
stragglers in M67.",2006-04-13T01:50:19Z
SiO Maser Survey of the Inner Bar of the Galactic Bulge,"We surveyed 291 MSX/2MASS infrared objects in the 7 x 2 deg area of the
galactic center in the 43 GHz SiO J=1--0 v=1 and 2 maser lines, obtaining
accurate radial velocities of 163 detected objects. The surveyed area is the
region where the IRAS catalog is incomplete due to contamination by high source
density. The objects in the present MSX/2MASS sample were chosen to have
similar infrared characteristics to those of the previous SiO-maser-survey
samples based on the color selected IRAS sources. The sampling based on the
2MASS catalog causes a bias to the foreside objects of the bulge due to heavy
obscuration by interstellar dust; the detections are considerably leaned on the
V_{lsr}<0 side. The l--v diagram reveals two conspicuous features, which were
not present or tenuous in the previous studies: one feature indicating a linear
velocity increase with longitude with |l|<1.5 deg, which is likely associated
with the inner bar, and the other feature having considerably eccentric
velocities more than those of the normal x_1-orbit family feature. The
extinction-corrected K magnitudes (if used as a distance modulus) tend to show
a sequential deposition of these objects along the line of sight toward the
Galactic center depending on their radial velocities. The tendency that
appeared in the distance measures is consistent with the bulge-bar dynamical
model utilizing the periodic orbit families in the bar potential.",2006-05-09T06:18:04Z
"Can Galactic Cosmic Rays Account for Solar 6Li Without Overproducing
  Gamma Rays?","Cosmic-ray interactions with interstellar gas produces both 6Li, which
accumulates in the interstellar medium (ISM), and $\pi^0$ mesons, which decay
to gamma-rays which propagate throughout the cosmos. Local 6Li abundances and
extragalactic gamma-rays thus have a common origin which tightly links them. We
exploit this connection to use gamma-ray observations to infer the contribution
to 6Li nucleosynthesis by standard Galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) interactions with
the ISM. Our calculation uses a carefully propagated cosmic-ray spectrum and
accounts for 6Li production from both fusion reactions ($\alpha \alpha \to
^6Li$) as well as from spallation channels (${p,\alpha+CNO \to ^6Li$). We find
that although extreme assumptions yield a consistent picture, more realistic
ones indicate that solar 6Li cannot be produced by standard GCRs alone without
overproducing the hadronic gamma rays. Implications for the primordial 6Li
production by decaying dark matter and cosmic rays from cosmological structure
formation are discussed. Upcoming gamma-ray observations by GLAST will be
crucial for determining the resolution of this problem.",2006-05-26T20:01:04Z
Multi-colour Imaging of Ultra-compact Objects in the Fornax Cluster,"Ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) are a new type of galaxy we have
discovered in the central region of the Fornax and Virgo clusters. Unresolved
in ground-based imaging, UCDs have spectra typical of old stellar systems.
Ninety-two have been found in Fornax, making them the most numerous galaxy type
in the cluster. Here we present multicolour (u'g'r'i'z') imaging of the central
region of the Fornax Cluster using the CTIO 4m Mosaic Telescope. The
colour-magnitude relation for bright UCDs is qualitatively consistent with UCDs
being the stripped nuclei of dE,Ns. However at faint magnitudes, GCs and UCDs
cannot be distinguished by colour alone. High resolution spectroscopy to
measure their internal velocity dispersions and metallicities, is needed to
distinguish between GCs and UCDs.",2006-05-19T21:47:53Z
"The Spin-Resolved Atomic Velocity Distribution and 21-cm Line Profile of
  Dark-Age Gas","The 21-cm hyperfine line of atomic hydrogen (HI) is a promising probe of the
cosmic dark ages. In past treatments of 21-cm radiation it was assumed the
hyperfine level populations of HI could be characterized by a
velocity-independent ``spin temperature'' T_s determined by a competition
between 21-cm radiative transitions, spin-changing collisions, and (at lower
redshifts) Lyman-alpha scattering. However we show here that, if the
collisional time is comparable to the radiative time, the spin temperature will
depend on atomic velocity, T_s=T_s(v), and one must replace the usual hyperfine
level rate equations with a Boltzmann equation describing the spin and velocity
dependence of the HI distribution function. We construct here the Boltzmann
equation relevant to the cosmic dark ages and solve it using a basis-function
method. Accounting for the actual spin-resolved atomic velocity distribution
results in up to a 2 per cent suppression of the 21-cm emissivity, and a
redshift and angular-projection dependent suppression or enhancement of the
linear power spectrum of 21-cm fluctuations of up to 5 per cent. The effect on
the 21-cm line profile is more dramatic -- its full-width at half maximum
(FWHM) can be enhanced by up to 60 per cent relative to the
velocity-independent calculation. We discuss the implications for 21-cm
tomography of the dark ages.",2006-05-02T20:00:03Z
Radial Kinematics of Isolated Elliptical Galaxies,"Ellipticals in very low density environments are extremely rare but hold
important clues about galaxy formation and evolution. In this paper we continue
our study of isolated elliptical galaxies, presenting results on the radial
stellar kinematics for 13 isolated early-type galaxies. We derive radial
rotation velocity, velocity dispersion and hermite terms to ~1 effective
radius. We observe a dichotomy in kinematic properties similar to that in the
elliptical population as a whole, where low luminosity ellipticals tend to be
rotationally supported. For all galaxies the V/sigma ratio increases with
radius. We find kinematically distinct cores (KDCs), or velocity substructure,
in ~40% of the galaxies for which we have major axis spectra. Such a fraction
is similar to that observed for ellipticals in higher density environments.
Most galaxies in the sample reveal kinematic evidence for a nuclear disk. The
non-relaxed kinematics in several galaxies suggests that they have undergone a
merger or accretion event. Isolated ellipticals generally follow the
fundamental plane defined by cluster ellipticals -- exceptions being those
galaxies with evidence for young stellar populations. Overall, we find isolated
ellipticals have similar kinematic properties to their counterparts in higher
density environments.",2006-04-21T01:54:03Z
"Transverse and longitudinal correlation functions in the Intergalactic
  Medium from 32 close pairs of high-redshift quasars","We present the transverse flux correlation function of the Lyman-alpha forest
in quasar absorption spectra at z~2.1 from VLT-FORS and VLT-UVES observations
of a total of 32 pairs of quasars; 26 pairs with separations in the range
0.6<theta<4 arcmin and 6 pairs with 4<theta<10 arcmin. Correlation is detected
at the 3sigma level up to separations of the order of ~4 arcmin (or ~4.4 h^{-1}
Mpc comoving at z=2.1 for Omega_{m}=0.3 and Omega_{Lambda}=0.7). We have,
furthermore, measured the longitudinal correlation function at a somewhat
higher mean redshift (z=2.39) from 20 lines of sight observed with high
spectral resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio with VLT-UVES. We compare
the observed transverse and longitudinal correlation functions to that obtained
from numerical simulations and illustrate the effect of spectral resolution,
thermal broadening and peculiar motions. The shape and correlation length of
the correlation functions are in good agreement with those expected from
absorption by the filamentary and sheet-like structures in the photoionized
warm intergalactic medium predicted in CDM-like models for structures
formation. Using a sample of 139 C_{iv} systems detected along the lines of
sight toward the pairs of quasars we also investigate the transverse
correlation of metals on the same scales. The observed transverse correlation
function of intervening C_{iv} absorption systems is consistent with that of a
randomly distributed population of absorbers. This is likely due to the small
number of pairs with separation less than 2 arcmin. We detect, however, a
significant overdensity of systems in the sightlines towards the quartet
Q0103-294A&B, Q0102-2931 and Q0102-293 which extends over the redshift range
1.5<z<2.2 and an angular scale larger than 10 arcmin.",2006-05-24T09:13:50Z
"CCD photometry and visual observations of V1663 Aquilae (Nova Aquilae
  2005)","We present CCD V and I band photometry and visual observations of V1663
Aquilae (Nova Aquilae 2005). This was a classical fast nova, probably of type
Ba, observed for the first time on 2005 June 9. Maximum light occurred at HJD=
2453531.2 +/- 0.2, when the apparent V magnitude was 10.7 +/- 0.1 and the V-I
colour index 3.1. Decline times were t2,V= 17d, t2,I= 18d, t3,V= 32d and t3,I=
35d. We derived a maximum absolute V magnitude of -7.8 +/- 0.2, colour excess
E(B-V)= 2, extinction AV= 6 magnitudes and distance d= 2.9 +/- 0.4 kpc. After
maximum the V-I colour index remained between 3.1 and 3.4 for 50 days, then
gradually reduced as the nova became bluer with increasing age. We saw no
direct evidence of dust emission although this could have contributed to the
high extinction in the direction of the nova.",2006-05-25T17:53:20Z
An Energetic Afterglow From A Distant Stellar Explosion,"We present the discovery of radio afterglow emission from the high redshift
(z=6.295) burst GRB 050904. The peak flux density for this burst is similar to
typical low-redshift gamma-ray bursts (GRB). We further show that beyond a
redshift of order unity, the flux density of radio afterglows are largely
insensitive to redshift, consistent with predictions. By combining the existing
X-ray, near-infrared and radio measurements, we derive estimates for the
kinetic energy and opening angle of the blast wave, and for the density of the
circumburst medium into which it expands. Both the kinetic and radiated energy
indicate that GRB 050904 was an unusally energetic burst (10**52 erg). More
importantly, we are able to make an in situ measurement of the density
structure of the circumburst medium. We conclude that GRB 050904 exploded into
a constant density medium with n=680 cm**-3, which is two orders of magnitude
above the nominal value for low-redshift GRBs. The next generation of
centimeter (EVLA) and millimeter radio instuments (ALMA) will be able to
routinely detect events like GRB 050904 and use them to study magnetic fields,
and the atomic and molecular gas in the high redshift Universe.",2006-04-27T19:54:30Z
"Two extremely metal-poor emission-line galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky

emission-line galaxies, J2104-0035 and J0113+0052, selected from the Data
Release 4 (DR4) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). From our data we
determine the oxygen abundance of these systems to be respectively 12+logO/H =
7.26+/-0.03 and 7.17+/-0.09, making them the two most metal-deficient galaxies
found thus far in the SDSS and placing them among the five most metal-deficient
emission-line galaxies ever discovered. Their oxygen abundances are close to
those of the two most metal-deficient emission-line galaxies known,
SBS0335-052W with 12+logO/H = 7.12+/-0.03 and I Zw 18 with 12+logO/H =

"Coronal density diagnostics with Si X: CHANDRA/LETGS observations of
  Procyon, $α$ Cen A$&$B, Capella and $ε$ Eri","Electron density diagnostics based on a line intensity ratio of Si X are
applied to the X-ray spectra of Procyon, $\alpha$ Cen A$&$B, Capella and
$\epsilon$ Eri measured with the Low Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer
(LETGS) combined with High-resolution Camera (HRC) on board the {\it Chandra
X-ray Observatory}. The ratio $R_1$ of the intensities of the Si X lines at
50.524 \AA and 50.691 \AA is adopted. A certain of the temperature effect in
$R_1$ appears near the low-density limit region, which is due to the
contamination of Si X line at 50.703 \AA . Using the emission measure
distribution (EMD) model derived by Audard et al. (2001) for Capella and
emissivities calculated with APEC model by Smith et al. (2001), we successfully
estimate contributions of Fe XVI lines at 50.367 \AA and 50.576 \AA (73% and
62%, respectively). A comparison between observed ratios and theoretical
predictions constrains the electron densities (in logarithmic) for Procyon to
be 8.61$^{+0.24}_{-0.20}$ cm$^{-3}$, while for $\alpha$ Cen A$&$B, Capella and
$\epsilon$ Eri to be 8.81$^{+0.27}_{-0.23}$ cm$^{-3}$, 8.60$^{+0.39}_{0.32}$
cm$^{-3}$, 9.30$_{-0.48}$ cm$^{-3}$ and 9.11$^{+1.40}_{-0.38}$ cm$^{-3}$,
respectively. The comparison of our results with those constrained by the
triplet of He-like carbon shows a good agreement. For normal stars, our results
display a narrow uncertainty, while for active stars, a relatively larger
uncertainty, due to the contamination from Fe XVI lines, is found. Another
possible reason may be that the determination of the continuum level, since the
emission lines of Si X become weak for the active stars. For $\epsilon$ Eri, an
electron density in the C V forming region was estimated firstly through Si X
emissions.",2006-04-10T00:33:41Z
"2D and 3D MHD Simulations of Disk Accretion by Rotating Magnetized
  Stars: Search for Variability","We performed 2D and full 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of disk accretion
to a rotating star with an aligned or misaligned dipole magnetic field. We
investigated the rotational equilibrium state and derived from simulations the
ratio between two main frequencies: the spin frequency of the star and the
orbital frequency at the inner radius of the disk. In 3D simulations we
observed different features related to the non-axisymmetry of the
magnetospheric flow. These features may be responsible for high-frequency
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). Variability at much lower frequencies may
be connected with restructuring of the magnetic flux threading the inner
regions of the disk. Such variability is specifically strong at the propeller
stage of evolution.",2006-04-05T22:30:23Z
The White Dwarf in AE Aqr Brakes Harder,"Taking advantage of the very precise de Jager et al. optical white dwarf
orbit and spin ephemerides; ASCA, XMMN, and Chandra X-ray observations spread
over 10 yrs; and a cumulative 27 yr baseline, we have found that in recent
years the white dwarf in AE Aqr is spinning down at a rate that is slightly
faster than predicted by the de Jager et al. spin ephemeris. At the present
time, the observed period evolution is consistent with either a cubic term in
the spin ephemeris with Pdouble_dot = 3.46(56)E-19 per d, which is inconsistent
in sign and magnitude with magnetic-dipole radiation losses, or an additional
quadratic term with Pdot = 2.0(1.0)E-15 d/d, which is consistent with a modest
increase in the accretion torques spinning down the white dwarf. Regular
monitoring, in the optical, ultraviolet, and/or X-rays, is required to track
the evolution of the spin period of the white dwarf in AE Aqr.",2006-04-13T17:57:58Z
Limits on CMBP B-Mode Measurements by Galactic Synchrotron Observations,"The B-Mode of the Cosmic Microwave Background Polarization (CMBP) promises to
detect the gravitational wave background left by Inflation and explore this
very early period of the Universe. In spite of its importance, however, the
cosmic signal is tiny and can be severely limited by astrophysical foregrounds.
In this contribution we discuss about one of the main contaminant, the diffuse
synchrotron emission of the Galaxy. We briefly report about recent deep
observations at high Galactic latitudes, the most interesting for CMB purposes
because of the low emission, and discuss the contraints in CMBP investigations.
The contamination competes with CMB models with T/S = 10^{-2}--10^{-3}, close
to the intrinsic limit for a 15% portion of the sky (which is T/S ~ 10^{-3}).
If confirmed by future surveys with larger sky coverage, this gives interesting
perpectives for experiments, that, targeting selected low emission regions,
could reach this theoretical limit.",2006-07-10T17:29:32Z
"Non-Gaussian Covariance of CMB B-modes of Polarization and Parameter
  Degradation","The B-mode polarization lensing signal is a useful probe of the neutrino mass
and to a lesser extent the dark energy equation of state as the signal depends
on the integrated mass power spectrum between us and the last scattering
surface. This lensing B-mode signal, however, is non-Gaussian and the resulting
non-Gaussian covariance to the power spectrum cannot be ignored as correlations
between B-mode bins are at a level of 0.1. For temperature and E-mode
polarization power spectra, the non-Gasussian covariance is not significant,
where we find correlations at the 10^{-5} level even for adjacent bins. The
resulting degradation on neutrino mass and dark energy equation of state is
about a factor of 2 to 3 when compared to the case where statistics are simply
considered to be Gaussian. We also discuss parameter uncertainties achievable
in upcoming experiments and show that at a given angular resolution for
polarization observations, increasing the sensitivity beyond a certain noise
value does not lead to an improved measurement of the neutrino mass and dark
energy equation of state with B-mode power spectrum. For Planck, the resulting
constraints on the sum of the neutrino masses is ~ 0.2 eV and on the dark
energy equation of state parameter we find, sigma_w ~ 0.5.",2006-07-21T06:26:33Z
"A photon breeding mechanism for the high-energy emission of relativistic
  jets","We propose a straightforward and efficient mechanism for the high-energy
emission of relativistic astrophysical jets associated with an exchange of
interacting high-energy photons between the jet and the external environment.
Physical processes playing the main role in this mechanism are
electron-positron pair production by photons and the inverse Compton
scattering. This scenario has been studied analytically as well as with
numerical simulations demonstrating that a relativistic jet (with the Lorentz
factor larger than 3--4) moving through the sufficiently dense, soft radiation
field inevitably undergoes transformation into a luminous state. The process
has a supercritical character: the high-energy photons breed exponentially
being fed directly by the bulk kinetic energy of the jet. Eventually particles
feed back on the fluid dynamics and the jet partially decelerates. As a result,
a significant fraction (at least 20 per cent) of the jet kinetic energy is
converted into radiation mainly in the MeV -- GeV energy range. The mechanism
maybe responsible for the bulk of the emission of relativistic jets in active
galactic nuclei, microquasars and gamma-ray bursts.",2006-04-16T20:23:24Z
Discovery of a Binary Centaur,"We have identified a binary companion to (42355) 2002 CR46 in our ongoing
deep survey using the Hubble Space Telescope's High Resolution Camera. It is
the first companion to be found around an object in a non-resonant orbit that
crosses the orbits of giant planets. Objects in orbits of this kind, the
Centaurs, have experienced repeated strong scattering with one or more giant
planets and therefore the survival of binaries in this transient population has
been in question. Monte Carlo simulations suggest, however, that binaries in
(42355) 2002 CR46 -like heliocentric orbits have a high probability of survival
for reasonable estimates of the binary's still-unknown system mass and
separation. Because Centaurs are thought to be precursors to short period
comets, the question of the existence of binary comets naturally arises; none
has yet been definitively identified. The discovery of one binary in a sample
of eight observed by HST suggests that binaries in this population may not be
uncommon.",2006-05-23T22:07:40Z
"Connection between accretion disk and superluminal radio jets and the
  role of radio plateau state in GRS 1915+105","We investigate the association between the accretion disk during radio
plateau state and the following superluminal relativistic radio jets with peak
intensity varies from 200 mJy to 1000 mJy observed over a period of five years
and present the evidences of direct accretion disc-jet connection in
microquasar GRS 1915+105. We have analysed RXTE PCA/HEXTE X-ray data and have
found that the accretion rate, $\dot{m}_{accr}$, as inferred from the X-ray
flux, is very high during the radio plateaux. We suggest that the accretion
disk during the radio plateaux always associated with radiation-driven wind
which is manifested in the form of enhanced absorption column density for X-ray
and the depleted IR emission. We find that the wind density increases with the
accretion disk luminosity during the radio plateaux. The wind density is
similar to the density of the warm absorber proposed in extragalactic AGNs and
Quasars. We suggest a simple model for the origin of superluminal relativistic
jets. Finally, We discuss the implications of this work for galactic
microquasars and the extragalactic AGNs and Quasars.",2006-04-05T12:07:02Z
Resolved Stellar Populations at the Distance of Virgo,"Top of the wish list of any astronomer who wants to understand galaxy
formation and evolution is to resolve the stellar populations of a sample of
giant elliptical galaxies: to take spectra of the stars and make
Colour-Magnitude Diagrams going down to the oldest main sequence turn-offs. It
is only by measuring the relative numbers of stars on Main Sequence Turnoffs at
ages ranging back to the time of the earliest star formation in the Universe
that we can obtain unambiguous star formation histories. Understanding star
formation histories of individual galaxies underpins all our theories of galaxy
formation and evolution. To date we only have detailed star formation histories
for the nearest-by objects in the Local Group, namely galaxies within 700kpc of
our own. This means predominantly small diffuse dwarf galaxies in a poor group
environment. To sample the full range of galaxy types and to consider galaxies
in a high density environment (where much mass in the Universe resides) we need
to be able to resolve stars at the distance of the Virgo (~17Mpc) or Fornax
(~18Mpc) clusters. This ambitious goal requires an Extremely Large Telescope
(ELT), with a diameter of 50-150m, operating in the optical/near-IR at its
diffraction limit.",2006-04-04T15:11:05Z
Signals of Inflation in a Friendly String Landscape,"Following Freivogel {\it et al} we consider inflation in a predictive (or
`friendly') region of the landscape of string vacua, as modeled by
Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos and Kachru. In such a region the dimensionful
coefficients of super-renormalizable operators unprotected by symmetries, such
as the vacuum energy and scalar mass-squareds are freely scanned over, and the
objects of study are anthropically or `environmentally' conditioned probability
distributions for observables. In this context we study the statistical
predictions of (inverted) hybrid inflation models, where the properties of the
inflaton are probabilistically distributed. We derive the resulting
distributions of observables, including the deviation from flatness
$|1-\Omega|$, the spectral index of scalar cosmological perturbations $n_s$
(and its scale dependence $dn_s/d\log k$), and the ratio of tensor to scalar
perturbations $r$. The environmental bound on the curvature implies a solution
to the $\eta$-problem of inflation with the predicted distribution of $(1-n_s)$
indicating values close to current observations. We find a relatively low
probability ($<3%$) of `just-so' inflation with measurable deviations from
flatness. Intermediate scales of inflation are preferred in these models.",2006-04-11T21:18:36Z
"Far-Ultraviolet & X-ray Observations of VV 114: Feedback in a Local
  Analog to Lyman Break Galaxies","We have analyzed FUSE, XMM, and Chandra observations of VV 114, a local
galaxy merger with strong similarities to typical high-redshift Lyman Break
Galaxies (LBGs). Diffuse thermal X-ray emission encompassing VV114 has been
observed by Chandra and XMM. This region of hot (kT~0.59 keV) gas has an
enhanced alpha to iron element ratio relative to solar abundances and follows
the same relation as typical starbursts between its properties (luminosity,
size, and temperature) and those of the starburst galaxy (star formation rate,
dust temperature, galaxy mass). These results are consistent with the X-ray gas
having been produced by shocks driven by a galactic superwind. The FUSE
observations of VV 114 show strong, broad interstellar absorption lines with a
pronounced blueshifted component(similar to what is seen in LBGs). This implies
an outflow of material moving at 300-400 km/s relative to VV 114. The
properties of the strong OVI absorption line are consistent with radiative
cooling at the interface between the hot outrushing gas seen in X-rays and the
cooler material seen in the other outflowing ions in the FUSE data. We show
that the wind in VV114 has not created a ``tunnel'' that enables more than a
small fraction (< few percent) of the ionizing photons from VV114 to escape
into the IGM. Taken together, these data provide a more complete physical basis
for understanding the outflows that seem to be generic in LBGs. This will lead
to improved insight into the role that such outflows play in the evolution of
galaxies and the inter-galactic medium.",2006-05-09T20:19:11Z
"Spitzer Survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud, Surveying the Agents of a
  Galaxy's Evolution (SAGE) I: Overview and Initial Results","We are performing a uniform and unbiased, ~7x7 degrees imaging survey of the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), using the IRAC and MIPS instruments on board the
Spitzer Space Telescope in order to survey the agents of a galaxy's evolution
(SAGE), the interstellar medium (ISM) and stars in the LMC. The detection of
diffuse ISM with column densities >1.2x10^21 H cm^-2 permits detailed studies
of dust processes in the ISM. SAGE's point source sensitivity enables a
complete census of newly formed stars with masses >3 solar masses that will
determine the current star formation rate in the LMC. SAGE's detection of
evolved stars with mass loss rates >1x10^-8 solar masses per year will quantify
the rate at which evolved stars inject mass into the ISM of the LMC. The
observing strategy includes two epochs in 2005, separated by three months, that
both mitigate instrumental artifacts and constrain source variability. The SAGE
data are non-proprietary. The data processing includes IRAC and MIPS pipelines
and a database for mining the point source catalogs, which will be released to
the community in support of Spitzer proposal cycles 4 and 5. We present initial
results on the epoch 1 data with a special focus on the N79 and N83 region. The
SAGE epoch 1 point source catalog has ~4 million sources. The point source
counts are highest for the IRAC 3.6 microns band and decrease dramatically
towards longer wavelengths consistent with the fact that stars dominate the
point source catalogs and that the dusty objects, e.g. young stellar objects
and dusty evolved stars that detected at the longer wavelengths, are rare in
comparison. We outline a strategy for identifying foreground MW stars, that may
comprise as much as 18% of the source list, and background galaxies, that may
comprise ~12% of the source list.",2006-06-14T18:59:49Z
New signposts of massive star formation in the S235A-B region,"We report on new aspects of the star-forming region S235AB revealed through
high-resolution observations at radio and mid-infrared wavelengths. Using the
Very Large Array, we carried out sensitive observations of S235AB in the cm
continuum (6, 3.6, 1.3, and 0.7) and in the 22 GHz water maser line. These were
complemented with Spitzer Space Telescope Infrared Array Camera archive data to
clarify the correspondence between radio and IR sources. We made also use of
newly presented data from the Medicina water maser patrol, started in 1987, to
study the variability of the water masers found in the region. S235A is a
classical HII region whose structure is now well resolved. To the south, no
radio continuum emission is detected either from the compact molecular core or
from the jet-like structure observed at 3.3 mm, suggesting emission from dust
in both cases. We find two new compact radio continuum sources (VLA-1 and
VLA-2) and three separate maser spots. VLA-1 coincides with one of the maser
spots and with a previously identified IR source (M1). VLA-2 lies towards S235B
and represents the first radio detection from this peculiar nebula that may
represent an ionized wind from a more evolved star. The two other maser spots
coincide with an elongated structure previously observed within the molecular
core in the C34S line. This structure is perpendicular to a bipolar molecular
outflow observed in HCO+(1-0) and may trace the associated equatorial disk. The
Spitzer images reveal a red object towards the molecular core. This is the most
viable candidate for the embedded source originating the outflow and maser
phenomenology. The picture emerging from these and previous data shows the
extreme complexity of a small (< 0.5 pc) star-forming region where widely

"Baryon Dynamics, Dark Matter Substructure, and Galaxies","By comparing a collisionless cosmological N-body simulation (DM) to an SPH
simulation with the same initial conditions, we investigate the correspondence
between the dark matter subhalos produced by collisionless dynamics and the
galaxies produced by dissipative gas dynamics in a dark matter background. When
galaxies in the SPH simulation become satellites in larger groups, they retain
local dark matter concentrations (SPH subhalos) whose mass is typically five
times their baryonic mass. The more massive subhalos of the SPH simulation have
corresponding subhalos of similar mass and position in the DM simulation; at
lower masses, there is fairly good correspondence, but some DM subhalos are in
different spatial positions and some suffer tidal stripping or disruption. The
halo occupation statistics of DM subhalos -- the mean number of subhalos,
pairs, and triples as a function of host halo mass -- are very similar to those
of SPH subhalos and SPH galaxies. Gravity of the dissipative baryon component
amplifies the density contrast of subhalos in the SPH simulation, making them
more resistant to tidal disruption. Relative to SPH galaxies and SPH subhalos,
the DM subhalo population is depleted in the densest regions of the most
massive halos. The good agreement of halo occupation statistics between the DM
subhalo and SPH galaxy populations leads to good agreement of their two-point
correlation functions and higher order moments on large scales. The depletion
of DM subhalos in dense regions depresses their clustering at R<1 Mpc/h. In
these simulations, the ""conversation"" between dark matter and baryons is mostly
one-way, with dark matter dynamics telling galaxies where to form and how to
cluster, but the ""back talk"" of the baryons influences small scale clustering
by enhancing the survival of substructure in the densest environments.",2006-04-18T21:32:24Z
Modelling of the spectra and atmospheres of evolved stars,"The method and results of the computation of the model atmospheres and
spectral energy distributions of chemically peculiar stars, are discussed. The
models are computed with a special consideration of the particular problems
encountered when computing model atmospheres for M and C-giants, and of
hydrogen deficient stars. We present some computed model atmospheres for
Sakurai's object, giants of globular clusters, and C-giants.",2006-06-11T16:08:40Z
"The chemical compositions of the extreme halo stars HE0107-5240 and
  HE1327-2326 inferred from 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres","We investigate the impact of realistic 3D hydrodynamical model stellar
atmospheres on the determination of elemental abundances in the carbon-rich,
hyper iron-poor stars HE0107-5240 and HE1327-2326. We derive the chemical
compositions of the two stars by means of a detailed 3D analysis of spectral
lines under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The lower
temperatures of the line-forming regions of the hydrodynamical models cause
changes in the predicted spectral line strengths. In particular we find the 3D
abundances of C, N, and O to be lower by ~ -0.8 dex (or more) than estimated
from a 1D analysis. The 3D abundances of iron-peak elements are also decreased
but by smaller factors (~ -0.2 dex). We caution however that the neglected
non-LTE effects might actually be substantial for these metals. We finally
discuss possible implications for studies of early Galactic chemical evolution.",2006-05-09T07:54:16Z
Gamma-Ray Bursts,"Gamma-ray bursts are the most luminous explosions in the Universe, and their
origin and mechanism are the focus of intense research and debate. More than
three decades after their discovery, and after pioneering breakthroughs from
space and ground experiments, their study is entering a new phase with the
recently launched Swift satellite. The interplay between these observations and
theoretical models of the prompt gamma ray burst and its afterglow is reviewed.",2006-05-09T19:40:56Z
"Survey for Transiting Extrasolar Planets in Stellar Systems IV:
  Variables in the Field of NGC 1245","The Survey for Transiting Extrasolar Planets in Stellar Systems (STEPSS)
project is a search for planetary transits in open clusters. In this paper, we
analyze the STEPSS observations of the open cluster NGC 1245 to determine the
variable star content of the cluster. Out of 6787 stars observed with V < 22,
of which ~870 are cluster members, we find 14 stars with clear intrinsic
variability that are potential cluster members, and 29 clear variables that are
not cluster members. None of these variables have been previously identified.
We present light curves, finding charts, and stellar/photometric data on these
variable objects. Several of the interacting binaries have estimated distances
consistent with the cluster distance determined from isochrone fits to the
color magnitude diagram. Four stars at the main sequence turnoff of the cluster
have light curves consistent with gamma Doradus variability. If these gamma
Doradus candidates are confirmed, they represent the oldest and coolest members
of this class of variable discovered to date.",2006-04-03T21:49:04Z
"Lyman Break Galaxies Under a Microscope: The Small Scale Dynamics and
  Mass of an Arc in the Cluster 1E0657-56","Using the near-infrared integral-field spectrograph SPIFFI on the VLT, we
have studied the spatially-resolved dynamics in the z=3.2 strongly lensed
galaxy 1E0657-56 ``arc+core''. The lensing configuration suggests that the high
surface brightness ``core'' is the M=20 magnified central 1 kpc of the galaxy
(seen at a spatial resolution of about 200 pc in the source plane), whereas the
fainter ``arc'' is a more strongly magnified peripheral region of the same
galaxy at about a half-light radius, which otherwise appears to be a typical
z=3 Lyman break galaxy.
  The overall shape of the position-velocity diagram resembles the ``rotation
curves'' of the inner few kpcs of nearby L* spiral galaxies. The projected
velocities rise rapidly to 75 km/s within the core. This implies a dynamical
mass of M_dyn = 10^9.3 M_sun within the central kpc, and suggests that in this
system the equivalent of the mass of a present-day L* bulge at the same radius
was already in place by z>=3. Approximating the circular velocity of the halo
by the measured asymptotic velocity of the rotation curve, we estimate a dark
matter halo mass of M_halo = 10^11.7 +/- 0.3, in good agreement with
large-scale clustering studies of Lyman break galaxies. The baryonic collapse
fraction is low compared to actively star-forming ``BX'' and low-redshift
galaxies around z=2, perhaps implying comparatively less gas infall to small
radii or efficient feedback. Even more speculatively, the high central mass
density might indicate highly dissipative gas collapse in very early stages of
galaxy evolution, in approximate agreement with what is expected for
``inside-out'' galaxy formation models.",2006-06-21T16:20:30Z
"On-axis spectroscopy of the host galaxies of 20 optically luminous
  quasars at z~0.3","We present the analysis of a sample of 20 bright low-redshift quasars
(M_B<-23 and z < 0.35) observed spectroscopically with the VLT. The FORS1
spectra, obtained in Multi Object Spectroscopy (MOS) mode, allow to observe
simultaneously the quasars and several reference stars used to spatially
deconvolve the data. Applying the MCS deconvolution method, we are able to
separate the individual spectra of the quasar and of the underlying host
galaxy. Contrary to some previous claims, we find that luminous quasars are not
exclusively hosted by massive ellipticals. Most quasar host galaxies harbour
large amounts of gas, irrespective of their morphological type. Moreover, the
stellar content of half of the hosts is a young Sc-like population, associated
with a rather low metallicity interstellar medium. A significant fraction of
the galaxies contain gas ionized at large distances by the quasar radiation.
This large distance ionization is always associated with signs of gravitational
interactions (as detected from images or disturbed rotation curves). The
spectra of the quasars themselves provide evidence that gravitational
interactions bring dust and gas in the immediate surrounding of the super
massive black hole, allowing to feed it. The quasar activity might thus be
triggered (1) in young gas-rich spiral galaxies by local events and (2) in more
evolved galaxies by gravitational interactions or collisions. The latter
mechanism gives rises to the most powerful quasars. Finally, we derive mass
models for the isolated spiral host galaxies and we show that the most reliable
estimators of the systemic redshift in the quasar spectrum are the tips of the
Ha and Hb lines.",2006-05-11T10:37:46Z
Galactic Warps Induced By Cosmic Infall,"Recent ideas for the origin and persistence of the warps commonly observed in
disc galaxies have focused on cosmic infall. We present N-body simulations of
an idealized form of cosmic infall onto a disc galaxy and obtain a warp that
closely resembles those observed. The inner disc tilts remarkably rigidly,
indicating strong cohesion due to self-gravity. The line of nodes of the warp
inside $R_{26.5} ~ 4.5 \Rd$ is straight, while that beyond $R_{26.5}$ generally
forms a loosely-wound, leading spiral in agreement with Briggs's rules. We
focus on the mechanism of the warp and show that the leading spiral arises from
the torques from the misaligned inner disc and its associated inner oblate
halo. The fact that the line of nodes of most warps forms a leading spiral
might imply that the disc mass is significant in the centre. If the line of
nodes can be traced to very large radii in future observations, it may reveal
information on the mass distribution of the outer halo. The warp is not
strongly damped by the halo because the precession rate of the inner disc is
slow and the inner halo generally remains aligned with the inner disc. Thus
even after the imposed quadrupolar perturbation is removed, the warp persists
for a few Gyrs, by which time another infall event can be expected.",2006-04-25T20:01:08Z
Optical and Infrared Diagnostics of SDSS galaxies in the SWIRE Survey,"We present the rest-frame optical and infrared colours of a complete sample
of 1114 z<0.3 galaxies from the Spitzer Wide-area InfraRed Extragalactic Legacy
Survey (SWIRE) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We discuss the optical
and infrared colours of our sample and analyse in detail the contribution of
dusty star-forming galaxies and AGN to optically selected red sequence
galaxies.
  We propose that the optical (g-r) colour and infrared log(L_{24}/L_{3.6})
colour of galaxies in our sample are determined primarily by a bulge-to-disk
ratio. The (g-r) colour is found to be sensitive to the bulge-to-disk ratio for
disk-dominated galaxies, whereas the log(L_{24}/L_{3.6}) colour is more
sensitive for bulge-dominated systems.
  We identify ~18% (195 sources) of our sample as having red optical colours
and infrared excess. Typically, the infrared luminosities of these galaxies are
found to be at the high end of star-forming galaxies with blue optical colours.
Using emission line diagnostic diagrams, 78 are found to have an AGN
contribution, and 117 are identified as star-forming systems. The red (g-r)
colour of the star-forming galaxies could be explained by extinction. However,
their high optical luminosities cannot. We conclude that they have a
significant bulge component.
  The number densities of optically red star-forming galaxies are found to
correspond to ~13% of the total number density of our sample. In addition,
these systems contribute ~13% of the total optical luminosity density, and 28%
of the total infrared luminosity density of our SWIRE/SDSS sample. These
objects may reduce the need for ""dry-mergers"".",2006-07-06T10:43:25Z
"Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS Observations of T Dwarfs: Brown Dwarf
  Multiplicity and New Probes of the L/T Transition","We present the results of a Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS imaging survey of
22 T-type field brown dwarfs. Five are resolved as binary systems with angular
separations of 0""05-0""35, and companionship is established on the basis of
component F110W-F170M colors (indicative of CH4 absorption) and low
probabilities of background contamination. Prior ground-based observations show
2MASS 1553+1532AB to be a common proper motion binary. The properties of these
systems - low multiplicity fraction (11[+7][-3]% resolved, as corrected for
sample selection baises), close projected separations (a = 1.8-5.0 AU) and
near-unity mass ratios - are consistent with previous results for field brown
dwarf binaries. Three of the binaries have components that span the
poorly-understood transition between L dwarfs and T dwarfs. Spectral
decomposition analysis of one of these, SDSS 1021-0304AB, reveals a peculiar
flux reversal between its components, as its T5 secondary is ~30% brighter at
1.05 and 1.27 micron than its T1 primary. This system, 2MASS 0518-2828AB and
SDSS 1534+1615AB all demonstrate that the J-band brightening observed between
late-type L to mid-type T dwarfs is an intrinsic feature of this spectral
transition, albeit less pronounced than previously surmised. We also find that
the resolved binary fraction of L7 to T3.5 dwarfs is twice that of other L and
T dwarfs, an anomaly that can be explained by a relatively rapid evolution of
brown dwarfs through the L/T transition, perhaps driven by dynamic
(nonequilibrium) depletion of photospheric condensates.",2006-05-22T22:28:40Z
Cosmic Calibration,"The complexity and accuracy of current and future precision cosmology
observational campaigns has made it essential to develop an efficient technique
for directly combining simulation and observational datasets to determine
cosmological and model parameters; a procedure we term calibration. Once a
satisfactory calibration of the underlying cosmological model is achieved,
independent predictions for new observations become possible. For this
procedure to be effective, robust characterization of the uncertainty in the
calibration process is highly desirable. In this Letter, we describe a
statistical methodology which can achieve both of these goals. An application
example based around dark matter structure formation simulations and a
synthetic mass power spectrum dataset is used to demonstrate the approach.",2006-06-07T15:08:47Z
"Laboratory Plasma Dynamos, Astrophysical Dynamos, and Magnetic Helicity
  Evolution","The term ``dynamo'' means different things to the laboratory fusion plasma
and astrophysical plasma communities. To alleviate the resulting confusion and
to facilitate interdisciplinary progress, we pinpoint conceptual differences
and similarities between laboratory plasma dynamos and astrophysical dynamos.
We can divide dynamos into three types: 1. magnetically dominated helical
dynamos which sustain a large scale magnetic field against resistive decay and
drive the magnetic geometry toward the lowest energy state, 2. flow-driven
helical dynamos which amplify or sustain large scale magnetic fields in an
otherwise turbulent flow, and 3. flow-driven nonhelical dynamos which amplify
fields on scales at or below the driving turbulence. We discuss how all three
types occur in astrophysics whereas plasma confinement device dynamos are of
the first type. Type 3 dynamos requires no magnetic or kinetic helicity of any
kind. Focusing on type 1 and 2 dynamos, we show how different limits of a
unified set of equations for magnetic helicity evolution reveal both types. We
explicitly describe a steady-state example of a type 1 dynamo, and three
examples of type 2 dynamos: (i) closed volume and time dependent; (ii)
steady-state with open boundaries; (iii) time dependent with open boundaries.",2006-04-10T21:22:48Z
"Einstein Field Equation: the Root of All Evil? Quantum Gravity, Solar
  Application and the Prediction on Gravity Probe B","The starting point of quantum mechanics is the relationship between energy

energy and momentum have not been treated equally. The wave equation required
by quantization is a differential equation which accordingly, does not treat

from the two sides of the equation. Dr. He's gravity is the local bending of
background space-time which as suggested by Einstein, can be described by a

Therefore, the Planck constant is completely canceled out in the resulting wave

BLAST Autonomous Daytime Star Cameras,"We have developed two redundant daytime star cameras to provide the fine
pointing solution for the balloon-borne submillimeter telescope, BLAST. The
cameras are capable of providing a reconstructed pointing solution with an
absolute accuracy < 5 arcseconds. They are sensitive to stars down to

"The NOAO Fundamental Plane Survey - III. Variations in the stellar
  populations of red-sequence galaxies from the cluster core to the virial
  radius","We analyse absorption line-strength indices for ~3000 red-sequence galaxies
in 94 nearby clusters, to investigate systematic variations of their stellar
content with location in the host cluster. The data are drawn from the NOAO
Fundamental Plane Survey. Our adopted method is a generalization of that
introduced by Nelan et al. to determine the global age-mass and
metallicity-mass relations from the same survey. We find strong evidence for a
change in galaxy properties, at fixed mass, over a range from the cluster
centre to the virial radius, R_200. For example, red-sequence galaxies further
out in the clusters have weaker Mgb5177 (at ~8 sigma significance) and stronger
Hbeta and Hgamma absorption (~3 sigma, ~4 sigma) than galaxies of the same
velocity dispersion in the cluster cores. The Fe5270 and Fe5335 indices show
only very weak trends with radius. Using a total of twelve indices, the pattern
of cluster-centric gradients is considered in light of their different
dependences on stellar age and chemical composition. The measured gradients for
all twelve indices can be reproduced by a model in which red-sequence galaxies
at ~1 R_200 have on average younger ages (by 15+/-4%) and lower alpha-element
abundance ratios (by 10+/-2%), than galaxies of the same velocity dispersion
but located near the cluster centre. For the total metallicity, Z/H, no
significant gradient is found (2+/-3% larger at R_200 than in the core). The
cluster-centric age and alpha/Fe gradients are in the sense expected if
galaxies in the cluster core were accreted at an earlier epoch than those at
larger radii, and if this earlier accretion contributed to an earlier cessation
of star formation. The size of the observed age trend is comparable to
predictions from semi-analytic models of hierarchical galaxy formation.",2006-03-27T15:43:54Z
"Keck Deep Fields. III. Luminosity-dependent Evolution of the Ultraviolet
  Luminosity and Star Formation Rate Densities at z~4, 3, and 2","We use the Keck Deep Fields UGRI catalog of z~4, 3, and 2 UV-selected
galaxies to study the evolution of the rest-frame 1700A luminosity density at
high redshift. The ability to reliably constrain the contribution of faint
galaxies is critical and our data do so as they reach to M*+2 even at z~4 and
deeper still at lower redshifts. We find that the luminosity density at high
redshift is dominated by the hitherto poorly studied galaxies fainter than L*,
and, indeed, the the bulk of the UV light in the high-z Universe comes from
galaxies in the luminosity range L=0.1-1L*. It is these faint galaxies that
govern the behavior of the total UV luminosity density. Overall, there is a
gradual rise in luminosity density starting at z~4 or earlier, followed by a
shallow peak or a plateau within z~3--1, and then followed by the well-know
plunge at lower redshifts. Within this total picture, luminosity density in
sub-L* galaxies evolves more rapidly at high redshift, z>~2, than that in more
luminous objects. However, this is reversed at lower redshifts, z<~1, a
reversal that is reminiscent of galaxy downsizing. Within the context of the
models commonly used in the observational literature, there seemingly aren't
enough faint or bright LBGs to maintain ionization of intergalactic gas even as
late as z~4. This is particularly true at earlier epochs and even more so if
the faint-end evolutionary trends we observe at z~3 and 4 continue to higher
redshifts. Apparently the Universe must be easier to reionize than some recent
studies have assumed. Nevertheless, sub-L* galaxies do dominate the total UV
luminosity density at z>~2 and this dominance further highlights the need for
follow-up studies that will teach us more about these very numerous but thus
far largely unexplored systems.",2006-05-17T02:22:04Z
"Constraints on a scale invariant power spectrum from superinflation in
  LQC","The computation of the spectrum of primordial perturbations, generated by a
scalar field during the super-inflationary phase of Loop Quantum Cosmology, is
revisited. The calculation is performed for two different cases. The first
considers the dynamics of a massless field and it is found that scale
invariance can only be achieved under a severe fine tuning. The second assumes
that the field evolves with a constant ratio between kinetic and potential
energy, i.e. in a scaling solution. In this case, near scale invariance is a
generic feature of the theory if the field rolls in a steep self interaction

"An Orphan in the ""Field of Streams""","We use Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5 photometry and spectroscopy to
study a tidal stream that extends over 50 degrees in the North Galactic Cap.
  From the analysis of the path of the stream and the colors and magnitudes of
its stars, the stream is about 20 kpc away at its nearest detection (the
celestial equator). We detect a distance gradient -- the stream is farther away
from us at higher declination. The contents of the stream are made up from a
predominantly old and metal-poor population that is similar to the globular
clusters M13 and M92. The integrated absolute magnitude of the stream stars is
estimated to be M_r = -7.5. There istentative evidence for a velocity
signature, with the stream moving at -40 km/s at low declinations and +100 km/s
at high declinations. The stream lies on the same great circle as Complex A, a
roughly linear association of HI high velocity clouds stretching over 30
degrees on the sky, and as Ursa Major II, a recently discovered dwarf
spheroidal galaxy. Lying close to the same great circle are a number of
anomalous, young and metal-poor globular clusters, including Palomar 1 and

"The Positions, Colors, and Photometric Variability of Pluto's Small
  Satellites from HST Observations 2005-2006","Pluto's two small satellites, temporarily designated S/2005 P 1 and S/2005 P

2.8 March 2006) using the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Advanced Camera for
Surveys (ACS). Here we collect together the astrometric positions of these two
satellites (henceforth P1 and P2), as well as a single color measurement for
each satellite and initial constraints on their photometric variability
obtained during these observations. We find that both satellites have
essentially neutral (grey) reflectivities, like Charon. We also find that
neither satellite exhibited strong photometric variation, which might suggest
that P1 and P2 are toward the large end of their allowable size range, and
therefore may have far lower reflectivities than Charon.",2006-04-29T20:08:36Z
Globular Cluster Formation in Mergers,"Mergers of gas-rich galaxies lead to gravitationally driven increases in gas
pressure that can trigger intense bursts of star and cluster formation.
Although star formation itself is clustered, most newborn stellar aggregates
are unbound associations and disperse. Gravitationally bound star clusters that
survive for at least 10-20 internal crossing times (~20-40 Myr) are relatively
rare and seem to contain <10% of all stars formed in the starbursts. The most
massive young globular clusters formed in present-day mergers exceed omega Cen
by an order of magnitude in mass, yet appear to have normal stellar initial
mass functions.
  In the local universe, recent remnants of major gas-rich disk mergers appear
as protoelliptical galaxies with subpopulations of typically 100-1000 young
metal-rich globular clusters in their halos. The evidence is now strong that
these ""second-generation"" globular clusters formed from giant molecular clouds
in the merging disks, squeezed into collapse by large-scale shocks and high gas
pressure rather than by high-velocity cloud-cloud collisions. Similarly, first-
generation metal-poor globular clusters may have formed during cosmological
reionization from low-metallicity giant molecular clouds squeezed by the
universal reionization pressure.",2006-06-01T20:00:45Z
Modeling Galaxy Clustering with Cosmological Simulations,"I review recent progress in understanding and modeling galaxy clustering in
cosmological simulations, with emphasis on models based on high-resolution
dissipationless simulations. During the last decade, significant advances in
our understanding of abundance and clustering of dark matter halos allowed
construction of accurate, quantitative models of galaxy clustering both in
linear and non-linear regimes. Results of several recent studies show that
dissipationless simulations with a simple, non-parametric model for the
relation between halo circular velocity and luminosity of the galaxy they host
predict the shape, amplitude, and luminosity dependence of the two-point
correlation function in excellent agreement with the observed galaxy clustering
in the SDSS data at z~0 and in the DEEP2 samples at z~1 over the entire probed
range of projected separations. In particular, the small-scale upturn of the
correlation function from the power-law form in the SDSS and DEEP2
luminosity-selected samples is reproduced very well. At z~3-5, predictions also
match the observed shape and amplitude of the angular two-point correlation
function of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) on both large and small scales,
including the theoretically predicted strong upturn at small scales. This
suggests that, like galaxies in lower redshift samples, the LBGs are fair
tracers of the overall halo population and that their luminosity is tightly
correlated with the circular velocity (and hence mass) of their dark matter
halos.",2006-07-20T04:54:31Z
A warped m=2 water maser disc in V778 Cyg?,"The silicate carbon star V778 Cyg is a source of 22 GHz water maser emission
which was recently resolved by MERLIN. Observations revealed an elongated
S-like structure along which the velocities of the maser features show a linear
dependence on the impact parameter. This is consistent with a doubly-warped m=2
disc observed edge-on. Water masers and silicate dust emission (detected by
IRAS and ISO) have a common origin in O-rich material and are likely to be
co-located in the disc. We propose a detailed self-consistent model of a masing
gas-dust disc around a companion to the carbon star in a binary system, which
allows us to estimate the companion mass of 1.7 +- 0.1 M_sun, the disc radius
of 40 +-3 AU and the distance between companions of about 80 AU. Using a
dust-gas coupling model for water masing, we calculate the maser power
self-consistently, accounting for both the gas and the dust energy balances.
Comparing the simulation results with the observational data, we deduce the
main physical parameters of the masing disc, such as the gas and dust
temperatures and their densities. We also present an analysis of the stability
of the disc.",2006-05-22T17:12:11Z
"Chandra X-Ray Observations of Nineteen Millisecond Pulsars in the
  Globular Cluster 47 Tucanae","We present spectral and long-timescale variability analyses of
\textit{Chandra} ACIS-S observations of the 19 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) with
precisely known positions in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae. The X-ray
emission of the majority of these MSPs is well described by a thermal
(blackbody or neutron star hydrogen atmosphere) spectrum with a temperature
$T_{\rm eff}\sim(1-3)\times10^6$ K, emission radius $R_{\rm eff}\sim0.1-3$ km,
and luminosity $L_{X}\sim10^{30-31}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. For several MSPs, there is
indication that a second thermal component is required, similar to what is seen
in some nearby field MSPs. The radio-eclipsing binary MSPs 47 Tuc J, O, and W
show a significant non-thermal component, with photon index $\Gamma\sim 1-1.5$,
which may originate in an shock formed due to interaction between the
relativistic pulsar wind and matter from the stellar companion. We re-examine
the X-ray--spindown luminosity relation ($L_{X}-\dot{E}$) and find that due to
the large uncertainties in both parameters the result is consistent with both
the linear $L_{X}-\dot{E}$ relation and the flatter $L_X\propto\dot{E}^{0.5}$
predicted by polar cap heating models. In terms of X-ray properties, we find no
clear systematic differences between MSPs in globular clusters and in the field
of the Galaxy.",2006-04-13T20:36:17Z
"The AGN Outflow in the HDFS Target QSO J2233-606 from a High-Resolution
  VLT/UVES Spectrum","We present a detailed analysis of the intrinsic UV absorption in the central
HDFS target QSO J2233-606, based on a high-resolution, high S/N (~25 -- 50)
spectrum obtained with VLT/UVES. This spectrum samples the cluster of intrinsic
absorption systems outflowing from the AGN at radial velocities v ~ -5000 --
-3800 km/s in the key far-UV diagnostic lines - the lithium-like CNO doublets
and H I Lyman series. We fit the absorption troughs using a global model of all
detected lines to solve for the independent velocity-dependent covering factors
of the continuum and emission-line sources and ionic column densities. This
reveals increasing covering factors in components with greater outflow
velocity. Narrow substructure is revealed in the optical depth profiles,
suggesting the relatively broad absorption is comprised of a series of multiple
components. We perform velocity-dependent photoionization modeling, which
allows a full solution to the C, N, and O abundances, as well as the velocity
resolved ionization parameter and total column density. The absorbers are found
to have supersolar abundances, with [C/H] and [O/H] ~0.5 -- 0.9, and [N/H] ~
1.1 -- 1.3, consistent with enhanced nitrogen production expected from
secondary nucleosynthesis processes. Independent fits to each kinematic
component give consistent results for the abundances. The lowest-ionization
material in each of the strong absorbers is modeled with similar ionization
parameters. Components of higher-ionization (indicated by stronger O VI
relative to C IV and N V) are present at velocities just redward of each
low-ionization absorber. We explore the implications of these results for the
kinematic-geometric-ionization structure of the outflow.",2006-04-17T18:18:41Z

"Time Variations of the Solar Neutrino Flux Data from Sage and Gallex-Gno
  Detectors Obtained by Rayleigh Power Spectrum Analysis","We have used Rayleigh power spectrum analysis of the monthly solar neutrino
flux data from (1) SAGE detector during the period from 1st January 1990 to
31st December 2000; (2) SAGE detector during the period from April 1998 to

periodicity around 4.3, 6.9, 10.3 and 18.1 months. We have found almost similar

that the solar activity cycle may be due to the variable character of nuclear
energy generation inside the sun.",2006-06-05T04:16:33Z
Interstellar Dust at the Magnetic Wall of the Heliosphere. II,"Several sets of data show that small interstellar grains captured in
interstellar magnetic fields draped over the heliosphere appear to polarize the
light of nearby stars. The maximum polarization direction is offset in ecliptic
longitude by about +35 from the upwind direction, and the polarization peak is
enhanced for stars near the ecliptic plane. A band of weak polarization
stretches through the southern ecliptic hemisphere to the downwind direction.
The interstellar field at the heliosphere is directed towards l=105 deg,
forming an angle of about 75 deg. with the inflowing gas. Grain alignment is
stable in the low density LIC, and is disrupted about 600 times more slowly
than in dense clouds. The polarization vanishes where the outer heliosheath
magnetic fields become tangled or reconnect. The dust in the local cloud
appears to be primarily olivines. The distribution of polarization depends on
the solar cycle phase.",2006-03-28T17:45:06Z
Relic gravitational waves and their detection,"As the strong evidence for inflation, the relic gravitational waves (RGW)
have been extensively studied. Although, it has not been detected, yet some
constraints have been achieved by the observations. Future experiments for the
RGW detection are mainly two kinds: the CMB experiments and the laser
interferometers. In this paper, we study these current constraints and the
detective abilities of future experiments. We calculate the strength of RGW
$\Omega_g(k)$ in two methods: the analytic method and the numerical method by
solving the inflationary flow equations. By the first method we obtain a bound
$\Omega_g<3.89\times10^{-16}$ at $\nu=0.1$Hz, where we have used the current
constraints on the scalar spectral index, the tensor-scalar ratio, furthermore,
we have taken into account of the redshift-suppression effect, the accelerating
expansion effect, the neutrino damping effect on the RGW. But the analytic
expression of $\Omega_g(k)$ depends on the specific inflationary models and not
well applies for the waves with very high frequencies. The numerical method is
more precise for the waves with high frequencies and applies to any
single-field inflationary model. It gives a bound
$\Omega_g<8.62\times10^{-14}$, which is independent of the inflationary
parameters, and applies to any single-field slow-roll inflationary model. After
considering the current constraints on the inflationary parameters, this bound
becomes $\Omega_g<2\times10^{-17}$ (see text).",2006-04-21T06:22:46Z
"SINFONI adaptive optics integral field spectroscopy of the Circinus
  Galaxy","Aims. To investigate the star formation activity and the gas and stellar
dynamics on scales of a few parsecs in the nucleus of the Circinus Galaxy.
Methods.Using the adaptive optics near infrared integral field spectrometer
SINFONI on the VLT, we have obtained observations of the Circinus galaxy on
scales of a few parsecs and at a spectral resolution of 70 km s^{-1} FWHM. The
physical properties of the nucleus are analyzed by means of line and velocity
maps extracted from the SINFONI datacube. Starburst models are constrained
using the Br-gamma flux, stellar continuum (as traced via the CO absorption
bandheads longward of 2.3um), and radio continuum. Results. The similarity of
the morphologies of the H_2 (1-0)S(1) 2.12um and Br-gamma 2.17um lines to the
stellar continuum and also their kinematics, suggest a common origin in star
formation. Within 8 pc of the AGN we find there has been a recent starburst in
the last 100 Myr, which currently accounts for 1.4% of the galaxy's bolometric
luminosity. The similarity of the spatial scales over which the stars and gas
exist indicates that this star formation is occuring within the torus; and
comparison of the gas column density through the torus to the maximum possible
optical depth to the stars implies the torus is a clumpy medium. The coronal
lines show asymmetric profiles with a spatially compact narrow component and a
spatially extended blue wing. These characteristics are consistent with some of
the emission arising in clouds gravitationally bound to the AGN, and some
outflowing in cloudlets which have been eroded away from the bound clouds.",2006-04-13T19:33:17Z
New advances in nebular photoionisation modelling,"The study of photoionised gas in planetary nebulae (PNe) has played a major
role achieving, over the years, a better understanding of a number of physical
processes pertinent to a broader range of fields than just PNe studies, ranging
from atomic physics to stellar evolution. Whilst empirical techniques are
routinely employed for the analysis of the emission line spectra of such
objects, the accurate interpretation of the observational data often requires
the solution of the radiative transfer (RT) problem in the nebula, via the
application of a photoionisation code.The development of the codes has been
driven by the observational constraints available, but also compromised by the
available computer power. Modern codes are faster and more flexible, with the
ultimate goal being the achievement of a description of the observations
relying on the smallest number of parameters possible. In this light, recent
developments have been focused on the inclusion of new atomic data, the
inclusion of a realistic treatment for dust grains mixed in the ionised and
photon dominated regions (PDRs) and the expansion of some codes to PDRs with
the inclusion of chemical reaction networks. Furthermore the last few years
have seen the development of fully 3D photoionisation codes based on the Monte
Carlo method. A review of the photoionisation codes currently in use is given
here, with emphasis on recent developments, including the expansion of the
models to the 3D domain, the identification of new observational constraints
and how these can be used to extract useful information from realistic
models.[Abridged]",2006-05-14T13:17:28Z

"Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect from the cross correlation of WMAP3 year
  and the NRAO VLA sky survey data: New results and constraints on dark energy","We cross-correlate the new 3 year Wilkinson Microwave Anistropy Probe (WMAP)
cosmic microwave background (CMB) data with the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS)
radio galaxy data, and find further evidence of late integrated Sachs-Wolfe
(ISW) effect taking place at late times in cosmic history. Our detection makes
use of a novel statistical method \cite{Baldi et al. 2006a, Baldi et al. 2006b}
based on a new construction of spherical wavelets, called needlets. The null
hypothesis (no ISW) is excluded at more than 99.7% confidence. When we compare
the measured cross-correlation with the theoretical predictions of standard,
flat cosmological models with a generalized dark energy component parameterized
by its density, $\omde$, equation of state $w$ and speed of sound $\cs2$, we
find $0.3\leq\omde\leq0.8$ at 95% c.l., independently of $\cs2$ and $w$. If
dark energy is assumed to be a cosmological constant ($w=-1$), the bound on
density shrinks to $0.41\leq\omde\leq 0.79$. Models without dark energy are
excluded at more than $4\sigma$. The bounds on $w$ depend rather strongly on
the assumed value of $\cs2$. We find that models with more negative equation of
state (such as phantom models) are a worse fit to the data in the case $\cs2=1$
than in the case $\cs2=0$.",2006-06-20T09:59:53Z
On Kinematic Substructure in the Sextans Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy,"We present multifiber echelle radial velocity results for 551 stars in the
Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy and identify 294 stars as probable Sextans
members. The projected velocity dispersion profile of the binned data remains
flat to a maximum angular radius of $30^{\prime}$. We introduce a nonparametric
technique for estimating the projected velocity dispersion surface, and use
this to search for kinematic substructure. Our data do not confirm previous
reports of a kinematically distinct stellar population at the Sextans center.
Instead we detect a region near the Sextans core radius that is kinematically
colder than the overall Sextans sample with 95% confidence.",2006-03-24T22:11:14Z
"Constraints on holographic dark energy models using the differential
  ages of passively evolving galaxies","Using the absolute ages of passively evolving galaxies observed at different
redshifts, one can obtain the differential ages, the derivative of redshift $z$
with respect to the cosmic time $t$ (i.e. ${\rm d} z/{\rm d}t$). Thus, the
Hubble parameter $H(z)$ can be measured through the relation $H(z)=-({\rm d}
z/{\rm d}t)/(1+z)$. By comparing the measured Hubble parameter at different
redshifts with the theoretical one containing free cosmological parameters, one
can constrain current cosmological models. In this paper, we use this method to
present the constraint on a spatially flat Friedman-Robert-Walker Universe with
a matter component and a holographic dark energy component, in which the
parameter $c$ plays a significant role in this dark energy model. Firstly we
consider three fixed values of $c$=0.6, 1.0 and 1.4 in the fitting of data. If
we set $c$ free, the best fitting values are $c=0.26$, $\Omega_{\rm m0}=0.16$,
$h=0.9998$. It is shown that the holographic dark energy behaves like a
quintom-type at the $1\sigma$ level. This result is consistent with some other
independent cosmological constrains, which imply that $c<1.0$ is favored. We
also test the results derived from the differential ages using another
independent method based on the lookback time to galaxy clusters and the age of
the universe. It shows that our results are reliable.",2006-05-23T17:48:10Z
"A Strong X-Ray Flux Ratio Anomaly in the Quadruply Lensed Quasar PG
  1115+080","PG 1115+080 is a quadruply lensed quasar at z=1.72 whose image positions are
well fit by simple models of the lens galaxy (at z=0.31). At optical
wavelengths, the bright close pair of images exhibits a modest flux ratio
anomaly (factors of ~1.2-1.4 over the past 22 years) with respect to these same
models. We show here that as observed in X-rays with Chandra, the flux ratio
anomaly is far more extreme, roughly a factor of 6. The contrasting flux ratio
anomalies in the optical and X-ray band confirm the microlensing hypothesis and
set a lower limit on the size of the optical continuum emission region that is

Dyadospheres Don't Develop,"Pair production itself prevents the development of dyadospheres, hypothetical
macroscopic regions where the electric field exceeds the critical Schwinger
value. Pair production is a self-regulating process that would discharge a
growing electric field, in the example of a hypothetical collapsing charged
stellar core, before it reached 6% of the minimum dyadosphere value, keeping
the pair production rate more than 26 orders of magnitude below the dyadosphere
value.",2006-05-18T17:39:43Z

"The Importance of Phase in Nulling Interferometry and a Three Telescope
  Closure-Phase Nulling Interferometer Concept","We discuss the theory of the Bracewell nulling interferometer and explicitly
demonstrate that the phase of the ""white light"" null fringe is the same as the
phase of the bright output from an ordinary stellar interferometer. As a
consequence a ""closure phase"" exists for a nulling interferometer with three or
more telescopes. We calculate the phase offset as a function of baseline length
for an Earth-like planet around the Sun at 10 pc, with a contrast ratio of
$10^{-6}$ at 10 $\mu$m. The magnitude of the phase due to the planet is $\sim
10^{-6}$ radians, assuming the star is at the phase center of the array.
Although this is small, this phase may be observable in a three-telescope
nulling interferometer that measures the closure phase. We propose a simple
non-redundant three-telescope nulling interferometer that can perform this
measurement. This configuration is expected to have improved characteristics
compared to other nulling interferometer concepts, such as a relaxation of
pathlength tolerances, through the use of the ""ratio of wavelengths"" technique,
a closure phase, and better discrimination between exodiacal dust and planets.",2006-03-24T17:23:34Z
"A New Measurement of the Stellar Mass Density at z~5: Implications for
  the Sources of Cosmic Reionization","We present a new measurement of the integrated stellar mass per comoving
volume at redshift 5 determined via spectral energy fitting drawn from a sample
of 214 photometrically-selected galaxies with z'<26.5 in the southern GOODS
field. Following procedures introduced by Eyles et al. (2005), we estimate
stellar masses for various sub-samples for which reliable and unconfused
Spitzer IRAC detections are available. A spectroscopic sample of 14 of the most
luminous sources with <z>=4.92 provides a firm lower limit to the stellar mass
density of 1e6 Msun/Mpc^3. Several galaxies in this sub-sample have masses of
order 10^11 Msun implying significant earlier activity occurred in massive
systems. We then consider a larger sample whose photometric redshifts in the
publicly-available GOODS-MUSIC catalog lie in the range 4.4 <z 5.6. Before
adopting the GOODS-MUSIC photometric redshifts, we check the accuracy of their
photometry and explore the possibility of contamination by low-z galaxies and
low-mass stars. After excising probable stellar contaminants and using the z'-J
color to exclude any remaining foreground red galaxies, we conclude that 196
sources are likely to be at z~5. The implied mass density from the unconfused
IRAC fraction of this sample, scaled to the total available, is 6e6 Msun/Mpc^3.
We discuss the uncertainties as well as the likelihood that we have
underestimated the true mass density. Including fainter and quiescent sources
the total integrated density could be as high as 1e7 Msun/Mpc^3. Using the
currently available (but highly uncertain) rate of decline in the star
formationhistory over 5 <z< 10, a better fit is obtained for the assembled mass
at z~5 if we admit significant dust extinction at early times or extend the
luminosity function to very faint limits. [abridged]",2006-04-12T19:41:03Z
"Probing unexplored territories with MUSE: a second generation instrument
  for the VLT","The Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) is a second-generation VLT
panoramic integral-field spectrograph under preliminary design study. MUSE has
a field of 1x1 arcmin**2 sampled at 0.2x0.2 arcsec**2 and is assisted by the
VLT ground layer adaptive optics ESO facility using four laser guide stars. The
simultaneous spectral range is 465-930 nm, at a resolution of R~3000. MUSE
couples the discovery potential of a large imaging device to the measuring
capabilities of a high-quality spectrograph, while taking advantage of the
increased spatial resolution provided by adaptive optics. This makes MUSE a
unique and tremendously powerful instrument for discovering and characterizing
objects that lie beyond the reach of even the deepest imaging surveys. MUSE has
also a high spatial resolution mode with 7.5x7.5 arcsec**2 field of view
sampled at 25 milli-arcsec. In this mode MUSE should be able to obtain
diffraction limited data-cubes in the 600-930 nm wavelength range. Although the
MUSE design has been optimized for the study of galaxy formation and evolution,
it has a wide range of possible applications; e.g. monitoring of outer planets
atmosphere, environment of young stellar objects, super massive black holes and
active nuclei in nearby galaxies or massive spectroscopic surveys of stellar
fields in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies.",2006-06-13T20:45:02Z
"Energy spectra of gamma-rays, electrons and neutrinos produced at
  proton-proton interactions in the very high energy regime","We present new parametrisations of energy spectra of secondary particles,
$\pi$-mesons, gamma-rays, electrons and neutrinos, produced in inelastic
proton-proton collisions. The simple analytical approximations based on
imulations of proton-proton interactions using the public available SIBYLL
code, provide very good accuracy for energy distributions of secondary products
in the energy range above 100 GeV. Generally, the recommended analytical
formulae deviate from the simulated distributions within a few percent over a
large range of $x=E_i/E_p$ - the fraction of energy of the incident proton
transferred to the secondaries. Finally, we describe an approximate procedure
of continuation of calculations towards low energies, down to the threshold of
$\pi$-meson production.",2006-06-02T15:53:44Z
"Line profiles of water for the photon dominated region and embedded
  sources in the S140 region","A radiative transfer method for the treatment of molecular lines is
presented. We apply this method to previous SWAS and ISO observations of water
vapor in the source S140 in order to make models to plan for, and to interpret,
HIFI data. Level populations are calculated with the use of a three-dimensional
(multi-zone) escape probability method and with a long characteristic code that
uses Monte Carlo techniques with fixed directions. Homogeneous and
inhomogeneous models are used to compute the differences between water line
profiles across the S140 region. We find that when an outflow or infall
velocity field with a gradient of a few kms^{-1} is adopted, line profiles with
a FWHM of 6 kms^{-1} are found, in agreement with observations. Inhomogeneous
models are favoured to produce a single-peaked line profile. When zooming in on
smaller regions within the PDR, the shapes of the line profiles start to differ
due to the different temperature and density distributions there. The embedded
sources are traced by high excitation lines of, e.g., 3_{21}-2_{21},
3_{03}-2_{12}, 2_{12}-1_{01} and 2_{20}-1_{11}. The computed intensities are
roughly consistent with existing ISO observations. Water emission in a PDR
source like S140 requires a combination of a pure PDR and an embedded source in
order to match the observations. Because of its good angular resolution, HIFI
will be able to distinguish between a dense star forming region or a more
diffuse gas component. It is therefore important for future observing programs
to consider both in their predictions of the emission characteristics of water
in these environments.",2006-03-24T15:13:18Z
Simulating Diffuse Light in Galaxy Clusters,"Using N-body simulations, we have modeled the production and evolution of low
surface brightness, diffuse intra-cluster light (ICL) in galaxy clusters. By
creating simulated observations of the clusters we have measured the evolution
of the ICL luminosity throughout the dynamical history of the clusters. We find
that ICL production tends to occur in short, discrete events, which correlate
very strongly with strong, small-scale interactions and accretions between
groups within the clusters.",2006-03-08T18:13:09Z
Anomalies in the low CMB multipoles and extended foregrounds,"We discuss how an extended foreground of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) can account for the anomalies in the low multipoles of the CMB
anisotropies. The distortion needed to account for the anomalies is consistent
with a cold spot with the spatial geometry of the Local Supercluster (LSC) and
a temperature quadrupole of order DeltaT_2^2 ~ 50 microK^2. If this hypothetic
foreground is subtracted from the CMB data, the amplitude of the quadrupole
(l=2) is substantially increased, and the statistically improbable alignment of
the quadrupole with the octopole (l=3) is substantially weakened, increasing
dramatically the likelihood of the ""cleaned"" maps. By placing the foreground on
random locations and then computing the likelihood of the cleaned maps we can
estimate the most likely place for this foreground. Although the 1-year WMAP
data clearly points the location of this hypothetical foreground to the LSC or
its specular image (i.e., the vicinity of the poles of the cosmic dipole axis),
the three-year data seems to point to these locations as well as the north
ecliptic pole. We show that this is consistent with the symmetries of the
cosmic quadrupole. We also discuss a possible mechanism that could have
generated this foreground: the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect caused by hot
electrons in the LSC. We argue that the temperature and density of the hot gas
which are necessary to generate such an effect, though in the upper end of the
expected range of values, are marginally consistent with present observations
of the X-ray background of spectral distortions of the CMB.",2006-05-10T19:23:14Z
Near-Infrared Photometry of Carbon Stars,"Near-infrared, JHKL, photometry of 239 Galactic carbon-rich variable stars is
presented and discussed. From these and published data the stars were
classified as Mira or non-Mira variables and amplitudes and pulsation periods,
ranging from 222 to 948 days for the Miras, were determined for most of them. A
comparison of the colour and period relations with those of similar stars in
the Large Magellanic Cloud indicates minor differences, which may be the
consequence of sample selection effects. Apparent bolometric magnitudes were
determined by combining the mean JHKL fluxes with mid-infrared photometry from
IRAS and MSX. Then, using the Mira period luminosity relation to set the
absolute magnitudes, distances were determined -- to greater accuracy than has
hitherto been possible for this type of star. Bolometric corrections to the K
magnitude were calculated and prescriptions derived for calculating these from
various colours. Mass-loss rates were also calculated and compared to values in
the literature.
  Approximately one third of the C-rich Miras and an unknown fraction of the
non-Miras exhibit apparently random obscuration events that are reminiscent of
the phenomena exhibited by the hydrogen deficient RCB stars. The underlying
cause of this is unclear, but it may be that mass loss, and consequently dust
formation, is very easily triggered from these very extended atmospheres.",2006-03-18T13:23:29Z
"Variability and multi-periodic oscillations in the X-ray light curve of
  the classical nova V4743 Sgr","The classical nova V4743 Sgr was observed with XMM-Newton for about 10 hours
on April 4 2003, 6.5 months after optical maximum. At this time, this nova had
become the brightest supersoft X-ray source ever observed. We present the
results of a time series analysis performed on the X-ray light curve obtained
in this observation, and in a previous shorter observation done with Chandra 16
days earlier. Intense variability, with amplitude as large as 40% of the total
flux, was observed both times. Similarities can be found between the two
observations in the structure of the variations. Most of the variability is
well represented as a combination of oscillations at a set of discrete
frequencies lower than 1.7 mHz. At least five frequencies are constant over the
16 day time interval between the two observations. We suggest that a periods in
the power spectrum of both light curves at the frequency of 0.75 mHz and its
first harmonic are related to the spin period of the white dwarf in the system,
and that other observed frequencies are signatures of nonradial white dwarf
pulsations. A possible signal with a 24000 sec period is also found in the
XMM-Newton light curve: a cycle and a half are clearly identified. This period
is consistent with the 24278 s periodicity discovered in the optical light
curve of the source and thought to be the orbital period of the nova binary
system.",2006-07-07T23:51:13Z
"The nature and evolution of the highly ionized near-zones in the
  absorption spectra of z~6 quasars","We use state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations combined with a 1D
radiative transfer code to assess the extent to which the highly ionized
regions observed close to z~6 quasars, which we refer to as near-zones, can
constrain the ionization state of the surrounding IGM. We find the appearance
in Lya absorption of a quasar HII ionization front expanding into a neutral IGM
can be very similar to a classical proximity zone, produced by the enhancement
in ionizing flux close to a quasar embedded in a highly ionized IGM. The
observed sizes of these highly ionized near-zones and their redshift evolution
can be reproduced for a wide range of IGM neutral hydrogen fractions for
plausible values of the luminosity and lifetime of the quasars. The observed
near-zone sizes at the highest observed redshifts are equally consistent with a
significantly neutral and a highly ionized surrounding IGM. Stronger
constraints on the IGM neutral hydrogen fraction can be obtained by considering
the relative size of the near-zones in the Lya and Lyb regions of a quasar
spectrum. A large sample of high quality quasar absorption spectra with
accurate determinations of near-zone sizes and their redshift evolution in both
the Lya and Lyb regions should confirm or exclude the possibility that the
Universe is predominantly neutral at the highest observed redshifts. The width
of the discrete absorption features in these near-zones will contain important
additional information on the ionization state and the previous thermal history
of the IGM at these redshifts.",2006-07-14T11:31:41Z
The Formation of Globules in Planetary Nebulae,"We discuss the formation of globules in planetary nebulae, typified by those
observed in the Helix Nebula. We show that the properties of the globules,
their number, mass, separation, and overall geometry strongly support a
scenario in which globules are formed by the fragmentation of a swept-up shell
as opposed to models in which the knots form in the AGB wind. We show that the
RT or other instabilities which lead to the break-up of shells formed in the
nebulae by fast winds or ionization fronts can produce arrays of globules with
the overall geometry and within the mass range observed. We also show that the
presence of a magnetic field in the circumstellar gas may play an important
role in controlling the fragmentation process. Using field strengths measured
in the precursor AGB envelopes, we find that close to the central star where
the fields are relatively strong, the wavelengths of unstable MRT modes are
larger than the shell dimensions, and the fragmentation of the shell is
suppressed. The wavelength of the most unstable MRT mode decreases with
increasing distance from the star, and when it becomes comparable to the shell
thickness, it can lead to the sudden, rapid break-up of an accelerating shell.
For typical nebula parameters, the model results in numerous fragments with a
mass scale and a separation scale similar to those observed. Our results
provide a link between global models of PN shaping in which shells form via
winds and ionization fronts, and the formation of small scale structures in the
nebulae.",2006-05-11T22:44:06Z
Rapid Star Formation in the Presence of Active Galactic Nuclei,"Recent observations reveal galaxies in the early Universe (2<z<6.4) with
large reservoirs of molecular gas and extreme star formation rates. For a very
large range of sources, a tight relationship exists between star formation rate
and the luminosity of the HCN J=1-0 spectral line, but sources at redshifts of
z~2 and beyond do not follow this trend. The deficit in HCN is conventionally
explained by an excess of infrared (IR) radiation due to active galactic nuclei
(AGN). We show in this letter not only that the presence of AGN cannot account
for the excess of IR over molecular luminosity, but also that the observed
abundance of HCN is in fact consistent with a population of stars forming from
near-primordial gas.",2006-06-07T16:33:41Z
"LIRIS multi-slit H_alpha spectroscopy of a z ~ 1 DEEP2 sample of

H_alpha luminosities of about 50 star-forming galaxies at z ~ 1, with the aim
of deriving the corresponding star formation rates (SFRs) from H_alpha as well
as studying the relationship with other SFR indicators. The new galaxy sample

Note on Redshift Distortion in Fourier Space,"We explore features of redshift distortion in Fourier analysis of N-body
simulations. The phases of the Fourier modes of the dark matter density
fluctuation are generally shifted by the peculiar motion along the line of
sight, the induced phase shift is stochastic and has probability distribution
function (PDF) symmetric to the peak at zero shift while the exact shape
depends on the wave vector, except on very large scales where phases are
invariant by linear perturbation theory. Analysis of the phase shifts motivates
our phenomenological models for the bispectrum in redshift space. Comparison
with simulations shows that our toy models are very successful in modeling
bispectrum of equilateral and isosceles triangles at large scales. In the
second part we compare the monopole of the power spectrum and bispectrum in the
radial and plane-parallel distortion to test the plane-parallel approximation.
We confirm the results of Scoccimarro (2000) that difference of power spectrum
is at the level of 10%, in the reduced bispectrum such difference is as small
as a few percents. However, on the plane perpendicular to the line of sight of
k_z=0, the difference in power spectrum between the radial and plane-parallel
approximation can be more than 10%, and even worse on very small scales. Such
difference is prominent for bispectrum, especially for those configurations of
tilted triangles. The non-Gaussian signals under radial distortion on small
scales are systematically biased downside than that in plane-parallel
approximation, while amplitudes of differences depend on the opening angle of
the sample to the observer. The observation gives warning to the practice of
using the power spectrum and bispectrum measured on the k_z=0 plane as
estimation of the real space statistics.",2006-04-11T07:07:14Z
The effect of heavy element opacity on pre-main sequence Li depletion,"Recent 3-D analysis of the solar spectrum data suggests a significant change
of the solar chemical composition. This may affect the temporal evolution of
the surface abundance of light elements since the extension of the convective
envelope is largely affected by the internal opacity value. We analyse the
influence of the adopted solar mixture on the opacity in the convective
envelope of pre-main sequence (PMS) stars and thus on PMS lithium depletion.
The surface Li abundance depends on the relative efficiency of several
processes, some of them still not known with the required precision; this paper
thus analyses one of the aspects of this ``puzzle''. Focusing on PMS evolution,
where the largest amount of Li burning occurs, we computed stellar models for
three selected masses (0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 Msun, with Z=0.013, Y=0.27, alpha=1.9)
by varying the chemical mixture, that is the internal element distribution in
Z. We analysed the contribution of the single elements to the opacity at the
temperatures and densities of interest for Li depletion. Several mixtures were
obtained by varying the abundance of the most important elements one at a time;
we then calculated the corresponding PMS Li abundance evolution. We found that
a mixture variation does change the Li abundance: at fixed total metallicity,
the Li depletion increases when increasing the fraction of elements heavier
than O.",2006-04-07T12:37:20Z
Observational constraints on phantom-like braneworld cosmologies,"We investigate a simple braneworld model in which the universe contains only
cold dark matter and a cosmological constant, but the effective dark energy is
phantom-like because of extra-dimensional gravity effects. Modified gravity
screens the cosmological constant Lambda, allowing for a larger Lambda. In
practice, observations do not favour any significant screening. We use
supernova data, the cosmic microwave background shift parameter, and the baryon
oscillation peak in the galaxy distribution to constrain the model. We find the
mean value of Omega_m with 68% confidence limits, and an upper limit on
Omega_Lambda at the 68% confidence level. The best-fit model is very close to a
standard LCDM model, but the LCDM model provides a better fit since it has one
less parameter.",2006-05-29T15:55:10Z
Scalar field haloes as gravitational lenses,"A non-topological soliton model with a repulsive scalar self-interaction of
the Emden type provides a constant density core,similarly as the empirical
Burkert profile of dark matter haloes. As a further test, we derive the
gravitational lens properties of our model, in particular, the demarcation
curves between `weak' and `strong' lensing. Accordingly, strong lensing with
typically three images is almost three times more probable for our solitonic
model than for the Burkert fit. Moreover, some prospective consequences of a
possible flattening of dark matter haloes are indicated.",2006-03-13T14:49:20Z
On the migration of protogiant solid cores,"The increase of computational resources has recently allowed high resolution,
three dimensional calculations of planets embedded in gaseous protoplanetary
disks. They provide estimates of the planet migration timescale that can be
compared to analytical predictions. While these predictions can result in
extremely short migration timescales for cores of a few Earth masses, recent
numerical calculations have given an unexpected outcome: the torque acting on
planets with masses between 5 M_Earth and 20 M_Earth is considerably smaller
than the analytic, linear estimate. These findings motivated the present work,
which investigates existence and origin of this discrepancy or ``offset'', as
we shall call it, by means of two and three dimensional numerical calculations.
We show that the offset is indeed physical and arises from the coorbital
corotation torque, since (i) it scales with the disk vortensity gradient, (ii)
its asymptotic value depends on the disk viscosity, (iii) it is associated to
an excess of the horseshoe zone width. We show that the offset corresponds to
the onset of non-linearities of the flow around the planet, which alter the
streamline topology as the planet mass increases: at low mass the flow
non-linearities are confined to the planet's Bondi sphere whereas at larger
mass the streamlines display a classical picture reminiscent of the restricted
three body problem, with a prograde circumplanetary disk inside a ``Roche
lobe''. This behavior is of particular importance for the sub-critical solid
cores (M <~ 15 M_Earth) in thin (H/r <~0.06) protoplanetary disks. Their
migration could be significantly slowed down, or reversed, in disks with
shallow surface density profiles.",2006-07-07T21:07:46Z
"Spectral analyses of eighteen hot H-deficient (pre-) white dwarfs from
  the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4","Context: The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4 has provided spectra of
several new PG 1159 stars and DO white dwarfs. This increase in known hot
H-deficient compact objects significantly improves the statistics and helps to
investigate late stages of stellar evolution. Aims: From the optical SDSS
spectra, effective temperatures and surface gravities are derived in order to
place the observed objects in an evolutionary context. Especially the
connection between PG 1159 stars and DO white dwarfs shall be investigated.
Method: Using our non-LTE model atmospheres and applying chi^2-fitting
techniques, we determine stellar parameters and their errors. We derive total
stellar masses for the DO white dwarfs using model evolutionary tracks.
Results: We confirm three PG 1159 stars, with one showing ultra-high excitation
ion features, and one sdO which we originally classified as a PG 1159 star.
Additionally, we re-analysed the known PG 1159 star, PG 1424+535, with our new
models. Furthermore, we present the first spectral analyses of thirteen DO
white dwarfs, three of which show M-star features in their spectra, while two
display ultra-high excitation ion features.",2006-05-22T09:08:01Z
"Images of Vega Dust Ring at 350 and 450 microns: New Clues to the
  Trapping of Multiple-Sized Dust Particles in Planetary Resonances","We have used the SHARC II camera at Caltech Submillimeter Observatory to make
350 and 450 micron images of the Vega dust disk at spatial resolutions (FWHM)
of 9.7"" and 11.1"", respectively. The images show a ring-like morphology (radius
\~ 100 AU) with inhomogeneous structure that is qualitatively different from
that previously reported at 850 microns and longer wavelengths. We attribute
the 350/450 micron emission to a grain population whose characteristic size (~
1 mm) is intermediate between that of the cm-sized grains responsible for
emission longward of 850 microns and the much smaller grains (< 18 microns) in
the extensive halo, visible at 70 microns, discussed by Su et al. (2005). We
have combined our submillimeter images with Spitzer data at 70 microns to
produce 2-d maps of line-of-sight optical depth (relative column density).
These ""tau maps"" suggest that the mm-sized grains are located preferentially in
three symmetrically-located concentrations. If so, then this structure could be
understood in terms of the Wyatt (2003) model in which planetesimals are
trapped in the mean motion resonances of a Neptune-mass planet at 65 AU,
provided allowance is made for the spatial distribution of dust grains to
differ from that of the parent planetesimals. The peaks of the tau maps are, in
fact, located near the expected positions corresponding to the 4:3 resonance.
If this identification is confirmed by future observations, it would resolve an
ambiguity with regard to the location of the planet.",2006-06-14T16:53:02Z
"Solar differential rotation and meridional flow: The role of a
  subadiabatic tachocline for the Taylor-Proudman balance","We present a simple model for the solar differential rotation and meridional
circulation based on a mean field parameterization of the Reynolds stresses
that drive the differential rotation. We include the subadiabatic part of the
tachocline and show that this, in conjunction with turbulent heat conductivity
within the convection zone and overshoot region, provides the key physics to
break the Taylor-Proudman constraint, which dictates differential rotation with
contour lines parallel to the axis of rotation in case of an isentropic
stratification. We show that differential rotation with contour lines inclined
by 10 - 30 degrees with respect to the axis of rotation is a robust result of
the model, which does not depend on the details of the Reynolds stress and the
assumed viscosity, as long as the Reynolds stress transports angular momentum
toward the equator. The meridional flow is more sensitive with respect to the
details of the assumed Reynolds stress, but a flow cell, equatorward at the
base of the convection zone and poleward in the upper half of the convection
zone, is the preferred flow pattern.",2006-04-21T00:17:07Z
Distribution of dust clouds around the central engine of NGC 1068,"We studied the distribution of dust clouds around the central engine of NGC
1068 based on shifted-and-added 8.8 - 12.3 micron (MIR) multi-filter images and
3.0 - 3.9 micron (L-band) spectra obtained with the Subaru Telescope. In a
region of 100 pc (1.4"") around the central peak, we successfully constructed
maps of color temperatures and emissivities of the MIR and L-band continua as
well as the 9.7 micron and 3.4 micron dust features with spatial resolutions of
26 pc (0.37"") in the MIR and 22 pc (0.3"") in the L-band. Our main results are:
1) color temperature of the MIR continuum scatters around the thermal
equilibrium temperature with the central engine as the heat source while that
of the L-band continuum is higher and independent upon distance from the
central engine; 2) the peak of the 9.7 micron silicate absorption feature is
shifted to a longer wavelength at some locations; 3) the ratio of the optical
depths of the dust features is different from the Galactic values and show
complicated spatial distribution; and 4) there is a pie shaped warm dust cloud
as an enhancement in the emissivity of the MIR continuum extending about 50 pc
to the north from the central engine. We speculate that material falls into the
central engine through this cloud.",2006-05-19T01:24:30Z
No Astrophysical Dyadospheres,"It is shown how pair production itself would prevent the astrophysical
formation of dyadospheres, hypothetical regions where the electric field
exceeds the critical value for rapid Schwinger pair production. Pair production
is a self-regulating process that would discharge a growing electric field, in
the example of a hypothetical collapsing charged stellar core, before it
reached 6% of the minimum dyadosphere value, keeping the pair production rate
more than 26 orders of magnitude below the dyadosphere value, and keeping the
efficiency below 0.0002(M/M_sun)^{1/2}.",2006-05-18T17:41:09Z
"A sensitive survey for water maser emission towards Bok globules using
  the Robledo 70m antenna","We report the most sensitive water maser survey towards Bok globules to date,
using NASA's 70m antenna in Robledo de Chavela (Spain). We observed 207
positions within the CB catalog with a higher probability of harboring a young
star, using as selection criteria the presence of radio continuum emission
(from submillimeter to centimeter wavelengths), geometrical centers of
molecular outflows, peaks in maps of high-density gas tracers (NH3 or CS), and
IRAS point sources. We have obtained 7 maser detections, 6 of which (in CB 34,
CB 54, CB 65, CB 101, CB 199, and CB 232) are reported for the first time here.
Most of the water masers we detected are likely to be associated with young
stellar objects (YSOs), except for CB 101 (probably an evolved object) and CB
65 (uncertain nature). The water maser in CB 199 shows a relatively high shift
(~30 km/s) of its velocity centroid with respect to the cloud velocity, which
is unusual for low-mass YSOs. We speculate that high-velocity masers in this
kind of object could be related with episodes of energetic mass-loss in close
binaries. Alternatively, the maser in CB 199 could be pumped by a
protoplanetary or a young planetary nebula. CB 232 is the smallest Bok globule
(~0.6 pc) known to be associated with water maser emission, although it would
be superseded by the cases of CB 65 (~0.3 pc) and CB 199 (~0.5 pc) if their
association with YSOs is confirmed. All our selection criteria have
statistically compatible detection rates, except for IRAS sources, which tend
to be a somewhat worse predictor for the presence of maser emission.",2006-06-05T09:02:28Z
No-go theorem for k-essence dark energy,"We demonstrate that if k-essence can solve the coincidence problem and play
the role of dark energy in the universe, the fluctuations of the field have to
propagate superluminally at some stage. We argue that this implies that
successful k-essence models violate causality. It is not possible to define a
time ordered succession of events in a Lorentz invariant way. Therefore,
k-essence cannot arise as low energy effective field theory of a causal,
consistent high energy theory.",2006-06-23T13:06:51Z
On the Evolutionary History of Stars and their Fossil Mass and Light,"The total extragalactic background radiation can be an important test of the
global star formation history (SFH). Using direct observational estimates of
the SFH, along with standard assumptions about the initial mass function (IMF),
we calculate the total extragalactic background radiation and the observed
stellar density today. We show that plausible SFHs allow a significant range in
each quantity, but that their ratio is very tightly constrained. Current
estimates of the stellar mass and extragalactic background are difficult to
reconcile, as long as the IMF is fixed to the Salpeter slope above 1 Msun. The
joint confidence interval of these two quantities only agrees with that
determined from the allowed range of SFH fits at the 3-sigma level, and for our
best-fit values the discrepancy is about a factor of two. Alternative energy
sources that contribute to the background, such as active galactic nuclei
(AGN), Population III stars, or decaying particles, appear unlikely to resolve
the discrepancy. However, changes to the IMF allow plausible solutions to the
background problem. The simplest is an average IMF with an increased
contribution from stars around 1.5--4 Msun. A ``paunchy'' IMF of this sort
could emerge as a global average if low mass star formation is suppressed in
galaxies experiencing rapid starbursts. Such an IMF is consistent with
observations of star-forming regions, and would help to reconcile the fossil
record of star formation with the directly observed SFH.",2006-04-26T19:49:08Z
"Molecular line emission in HH54: a coherent view from near to far
  infrared","Aims. We present a detailed study of the infrared line emission (1-200
micron) in the Herbig-Haro object HH54. Our database comprises: high- (R~9000)
and low- (R~600) resolution spectroscopic data in the near-infrared band (1-2.5
micron); mid-infrared spectrophotometric images (5-12 micron); and, far-IR
(45-200 micron, R~200) spectra acquired with the ISO satellite. As a result, we
provide the detection of and the absolute fluxes for more than 60 molecular
features (mainly from H2 in the near- and mid-infrared and from H2O, CO and OH
in the far-infrared) and 23 ionic lines. Methods. The H2 lines, coming from
levels from v=0 to v=4 have been interpreted in the context of a state-of-art
shock code, whose output parameters are adopted as input to a Large Velocity
Gradient computation in order to interpret the FIR emission of CO, H2O and OH.
Results. The H2 emission can be interpreted as originating in either
steady-state J-type shocks or in quasi-steady J-type shocks with magnetic
precursor. However, our multi-species analysis shows that only a model of a
J-type shock with magnetic precursor (v_shock=18 km/s, n_H=10^4 cm^-3, B=100
microG, age=400 yr) can account for both the observed H2 emission and the CO
and H2O lines. Such a model predicts a H2O abundance of ~ 7 10^-5, in agreement
with estimations from other shock models for outflows associated with low mass
protostars. We can exclude the possibility that the observed atomic lines arise
in the same shock as the molecular lines, and give arguments in favour of the
presence of a further high-velocity, fully dissociative shock component in the
region. Finally, in view of the forthcoming spectroscopic facilities on board
of the Herschel satellite, we provide predictions for H2O lines considered to
be the most suitable for diagnostic purposes.",2006-07-17T13:11:32Z
"Perturbation Theory Reloaded: Analytical Calculation of Non-linearity in
  Baryonic Oscillations in the Real Space Matter Power Spectrum","We compare the non-linear matter power spectrum in real space calculated
analytically from 3rd-order perturbation theory with N-body simulations at
1<z<6. We find that the perturbation theory prediction agrees with the
simulations to better than 1% accuracy in the weakly non-linear regime where
the dimensionless power spectrum, Delta^2(k)=k^3P(k)/2pi^2, which approximately
gives variance of matter density field at a given k, is less than 0.4. While
the baryonic acoustic oscillation features are preserved in the weakly
non-linear regime at z>1, the shape of oscillations is distorted from the
linear theory prediction. Nevertheless, our results suggest that one can
correct the distortion caused by non-linearity almost exactly. We also find
that perturbation theory, which does not contain any free parameters, provides
a significantly better fit to the simulations than the conventional approaches
based on empirical fitting functions to simulations. The future work would
include perturbation theory calculations of non-linearity in redshift space
distortion and halo biasing in the weakly non-linear regime.",2006-04-04T21:11:53Z
"Discovery of the two wings of the Kookaburra complex in VHE gamma -rays
  with H.E.S.S","Aims. Search for Very High Energy gamma-ray emission in the Kookaburra
complex through observations with the H.E.S.S. array. Methods. Stereoscopic
imaging of Cherenkov light emission of the gamma-ray showers in the atmosphere
is used for the reconstruction and selection of the events to search for
gamma-ray signals. Their spectrum is derived by a forward-folding maximum
likelihood fit. Results. Two extended gamma-ray sources with an angular (68%)
radius of 3.3-3.4' are discovered at high (>13sigma) statistical significance:
HESS J1420-607 and HESS J1418-609. They exhibit a flux above 1 TeV of
(2.97+/-0.18stat +/-0.60sys)x10-12 and (2.17+/-0.17stat +/-0.43sys)x10-12 cm-2
s-1, respectively, and similar hard photon indices ~2.2. Multi-wavelength
comparisons show spatial coincidence with the wings of the Kookaburra. Two
pulsar wind nebulae candidates, K3/PSR J1420-6048 and the Rabbit, lie on the
edge of the H.E.S.S. sources. Conclusions. The two new sources confirm the
non-thermal nature of at least parts of the two radio wings which overlap with
the gamma-ray emission and establish their connection with the two X-ray pulsar
wind nebulae candidates. Given the large point spread function of EGRET, the
unidentified source(s) 3EG J1420-6038/GeV J1417-6100 could possibly be related
to either or both H.E.S.S. sources. The most likely explanation for the Very
High Energy gamma-rays discovered by H.E.S.S. is inverse Compton emission of
accelerated electrons on the Cosmic Microwave Background near the two candidate
pulsar wind nebulae, K3/PSR J1420-6048 and the Rabbit. Two scenarios which
could lead to the observed large (~10 pc) offset-nebula type morphologies are
briefly discussed.",2006-06-13T12:45:21Z
Effects of architectural issues on a km3 scale detector,"Simulation results showing the comparison between the performance of

"K-Band Observations of Boxy Bulges. I. Morphology and Surface Brightness
  Profiles","Kn-band images, unsharp-masked images, as well as major-axis and vertically-
summed surface brightness profiles are presented for 30 edge-on spiral
galaxies, most with a boxy or peanut-shaped (B/PS) bulge. Such galaxies have
more complex morphologies than galaxies of other bulge types, more often
showing (off-)centered X structures, secondary major-axis maxima and
spiral-like structures. Those features are also observed in N-body simulations
of barred discs and may trace the main bar orbit families. The surface
brightness profiles of galaxies with a B/PS bulge are also more complex, with
typically 3 or more clearly separated regions, including a flat intermediate
region (Freeman Type II profiles). Those radial breaks offer evidence for
bar-driven transfer of angular momentum and radial redistribution of material.
The profiles also suggest a rapid variation of the scaleheight of the disc
material, contrary to conventional wisdom but again as expected from vertical
resonances and instabilities in barred discs. The steep inner region of the
surface brightness profiles is often shorter than the isophotally thick part of
the galaxies, itself always shorter than the flat region of the profiles.
Contrary to the standard `bulge + disc' model, we thus propose that galaxies
with a B/PS bulge are composed of a thin concentrated disc (a disc-like bulge)
contained within a partially thick bar (the B/PS bulge) and a thin outer disc.
The inner disc likely formed secularly through bar-driven processes and is
responsible for the steep inner region of the surface brightness profiles,
while the bar is responsible for the flat region and the thick complex
morphological structures observed. Those components are strongly coupled
dynamically and are formed mostly of the same (disc) material. [Abridged]",2006-06-02T15:06:24Z
"RApid Temporal Survey - RATS II: Followup observations of 4 newly
  discovered short period variables","The RApid Temporal Survey (RATS) is a survey to detect objects whose optical
intensity varies on timescales of less than ~70 min. In our pilot dataset taken
with the INT and the Wide Field Camera in Nov 2003 we discovered nearly 50 new
variable objects. Many of these varied on timescales much longer than 1 hr.
However, only 4 objects showed a modulation on a timescale of 1 hour or less.
This paper presents followup optical photometry and spectroscopy of these 4
objects. We find that RAT J0455+1305 is a pulsating (on a period of 374 sec)
subdwarf B (sdB) star of the EC 14026 type. We have modelled its spectrum and
determine Teff = 29,200+/- 1900K and log g = 5.2+/-0.3 which locates it on the
cool edge of the EC 14026 instability strip. It has a modulation amplitude
which is one of the highest of any known EC 14026 star. Based on their spectra,
photometric variability and their infra-red colours, we find that RAT
J0449+1756, RAT J0455+1254 and RAT J0807+1510 are likely to be SX Phe stars -
dwarf Delta Sct stars. Our results show that our observing strategy is a good
method for finding rare pulsating stars.",2006-06-26T15:50:40Z

Discovery of a z=6.1 Radio-Loud Quasar in the NDWFS,"From examination of only 4 deg^2 of sky in the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey
(NDWFS) region, we have identified the first radio-loud quasar at a redshift
z>6. The object, FIRST J1427385+331241, was discovered by matching the FLAMEX
IR survey to FIRST survey radio sources with NDWFS counterparts. One candidate
z>6 quasar was found, and spectroscopy with the Keck II telescope confirmed its
identification, yielding a redshift z=6.12. The object is a Broad Absorption
Line (BAL) quasar with an optical luminosity of M_B ~ -26.9 and a
radio-to-optical flux ratio ~ 60. Two MgII absorptions systems are present at
redshifts of z=2.18 and z=2.20. We briefly discuss the implications of this
discovery for the high-redshift quasar population.",2006-07-12T21:25:05Z
"Exoplanet detection with simultaneous spectral differential imaging:
  effects of out-of-pupil-plane optical aberrations","Imaging faint companions (exoplanets and brown dwarfs) around nearby stars is
currently limited by speckle noise. To efficiently attenuate this noise, a
technique called simultaneous spectral differential imaging (SSDI) can be used.
This technique consists of acquiring simultaneously images of the field of view
in several adjacent narrow bands and in combining these images to suppress
speckles. Simulations predict that SSDI can achieve, with the acquisition of
three wavelengths, speckle noise attenuation of several thousands. These
simulations are usually performed using the Fraunhofer approximation, i.e.
considering that all aberrations are located in the pupil plane. We have
performed wavefront propagation simulations to evaluate how out-of-pupil-plane
aberrations affect SSDI speckle noise attenuation performance. The Talbot
formalism is used to give a physical insight of the problem; results are
confirmed using a proper wavefront propagation algorithm. We will show that
near-focal-plane aberrations can significantly reduce SSDI speckle noise
attenuation performance at several lambda/D separation. It is also shown that
the Talbot effect correctly predicts the PSF chromaticity. Both differential
atmospheric refraction effects and the use of a coronagraph will be discussed.",2006-06-30T21:27:11Z
HI Density Distribution Driven by Supernovae: A Simulation Study,"We model the complex distribution of atomic hydrogen (HI) in the interstellar
medium (ISM) assuming that it is driven entirely by supernovae (SN). We develop
and assess two different models. In the first approach, the simulated volume is
randomly populated with non-overlapping voids of a range of sizes. This may
relate to a snapshot distribution of supernova-remnant voids, although somewhat
artificially constrained by the non-overlap criterion. In the second approach,
a simplified time evolution (considering momentum conservation as the only
governing constraint during interactions) is followed as SN populate the space
with the associated input mass and energy.
  We describe these simulations and present our results in the form of images
of the mass and velocity distributions and the associated power spectra. The
latter are compared with trends indicated by available observations. In both
approaches, we find remarkable correspondence with the observed statistical
description of well-studied components of the ISM, wherein the spatial spectra
have been found to show significant deviations from the Kolmogorov spectrum.
One of the key indications from this study, regardless of whether or not the
SN-induced turbulence is the dominant process in the ISM, is that the apparent
non-Kolmogorov spectral characteristics (of HI and/or electron column density
across thick or thin screens) needed to explain related observations may not at
all be in conflict with the underlying turbulence (i.e. the velocity structure)
being of Kolmogorov nature. We briefly discuss the limitations of our
simulations and the various implications of our results.",2006-03-29T22:30:22Z
A warped m=2 water maser disc in V778 Cyg?,"The silicate carbon star V778 Cyg is a source of 22 GHz water maser emission
which was recently resolved by MERLIN. Observations revealed an elongated
S-like structure along which the velocities of the maser features show a linear
dependence on the impact parameter. This is consistent with a doubly-warped m=2
disc observed edge-on. Water masers and silicate dust emission (detected by
IRAS and ISO) have a common origin in O-rich material and are likely to be
co-located in the disc. We propose a detailed self-consistent model of a masing
gas-dust disc around a companion to the carbon star in a binary system, which
allows us to estimate the companion mass of 1.7 +- 0.1 M_sun, the disc radius
of 40 +-3 AU and the distance between companions of about 80 AU. Using a
dust-gas coupling model for water masing, we calculate the maser power
self-consistently, accounting for both the gas and the dust energy balances.
Comparing the simulation results with the observational data, we deduce the
main physical parameters of the masing disc, such as the gas and dust
temperatures and their densities. We also present an analysis of the stability
of the disc.",2006-05-22T17:12:11Z
"Central stellar populations of early-type galaxies in low-density
  environments","We have investigated the properties of a volume and magnitude limited sample
of nearby early type galaxies that were carefully selected from the AAO two
degree field galaxy redshift survey. We used images from the DSS to confirm the
E/S0 morphologies, and augmented this sample with field galaxies from Colbert
et al. 2001. We present spectroscopic observations of 22 galaxies from the
combined sample, from which central velocity dispersions and the Lick stellar
population indices were measured. After carefully correcting the spectra for
nebular emission we derived luminosity-weighted ages, metallicities, and
alpha-element abundance ratios. We compare these isolated galaxies with samples
of early-type galaxies in the Virgo and Coma clusters, and also with the sample
of galaxies in low-density regions of Kuntschner et al. (2002). We find that
galaxies in low-density environments are younger and have a greater spread of
ages compared to cluster galaxies. They also show a wider range of
metallicities at a given velocity dispersion than cluster galaxies, which
display only super-solar metallicities. On average cluster, as well as,
isolated galaxies show non-solar abundance ratios in alpha-elements, suggesting
that, independent of galactic environment, star formation occurred on short
time-scales. We reason that early-type galaxies in low-density environments
experienced merging-induced star-formation episodes over a longer and more
recent period of time compared to a cluster environment, and speculate that a
considerable fraction of their stars formed out of low-metallicity halo gaseous
material during the slow growth of a stellar disk between merging events.",2006-05-24T10:28:48Z
Radial Velocity Studies of Southern Close Binary Stars.I,"Radial-velocity measurements and sine-curve fits to the orbital velocity
variations are presented for nine contact binaries, V1464 Aql, V759 Cen, DE
Oct, MW Pav, BQ Phe, EL Aqr, SX Crv, VZ Lib, GR Vir; for the first five among
these, our observations are the first available radial velocity data. Among
three remaining radial velocity variables, CE Hyi is a known visual binary,
while CL Cet and V1084 Sco are suspected to be multiple systems where the
contact binary is spectrally dominated by its companion (which itself is a
binary in V1084 Sco). Five additional variables, V872 Ara, BD Cap, HIP 69300,
BX Ind, V388 Pav, are of unknown type, but most are pulsating stars; we give
their mean radial velocities and Vsini.",2006-06-21T13:20:05Z
"Confirmation of the Planet Hypothesis for the Long-period Radial
  Velocity Variations of Beta Geminorum","We present precise stellar radial velocity measurements for the K giant star
Beta Gem spanning over 25 years. These data show that the long period low
amplitude radial velocity variations found by Hatzes & Cochran (1993) are
long-lived and coherent. An examination of the Ca II K emission, spectral line
shapes from high resolution data (R = 210,000), and Hipparcos photometry show
no significant variations of these quantities with the RV period. These data
confirm the planetary companion hypothesis suggested by Hatzes & Cochran
(1993). An orbital solution assuming a stellar mass of 1.7 M_sun yields a
period, P = 589.6 days, a minimum mass of 2.3 M_Jupiter, and a semi-major axis,
and a = 1.6 AU. The orbit is nearly circular (e = 0.02). Beta Gem is the
seventh intermediate mass star shown to host a sub-stellar companion and
suggests that planet-formation around stars much more massive than the sun may
common.",2006-06-21T12:43:24Z
"Statistics of Cosmological Black Hole Jet Sources: Blazar Predictions
  for GLAST","A study of the statistics of cosmological black-hole jet sources is applied
to EGRET blazar data, and predictions are made for GLAST. Black-hole jet
sources are modeled as collimated relativistic plasma outflows with radiation
beamed along the jet axis due to strong Doppler boosting. The comoving rate
density of blazar flares is assumed to follow a blazar formation rate (BFR),
modeled by analytic functions based on astronomical observations and fits to
EGRET data. The redshift and size distributions of gamma-ray blazars observed
with EGRET, separated into BL Lac object (BL) and flat spectrum radio quasar
(FSRQ) distributions, are fit with monoparametric functions for the
distributions of the jet Lorentz factor \Gamma, comoving directional power
l'_e, and spectral slope. A BFR factor ~10 x greater at z ~ 1 than at present
is found to fit the FSRQ data. A smaller comoving rate density and greater
luminosity of BL flares at early times compared to the present epoch fits the
BL data. Based on the EGRET observations, ~1000 blazars consisting of ~800
FSRQs and FR2 radio galaxies and ~200 BL Lacs and FR1 radio galaxies will be
detected with GLAST during the first year of the mission. Additional AGN
classes, such as hard-spectrum BL Lacs that were mostly missed with EGRET,
could add more GLAST sources. The FSRQ and BL contributions to the EGRET
gamma-ray background at 1 GeV are estimated at the level of ~10 - 15% and ~2 -
4%, respectively. EGRET and GLAST sensitivities to blazar flares are considered
in the optimal case, and a GLAST analysis method for blazar detection is
outlined.",2006-05-16T22:00:41Z
R Coronae Borealis at the 2003 Light Minimum,"High-resolution optical spectra of R CrB obtained in 2003 March is discussed.
The 2003 spectra are compared with the extensive collection of spectra from the
1995-1996 minimum. Spectroscopic features common to the two minima include
sharp emission lines of neutral and singly-ionized atoms, broad emission lines
including He {\sc i}, [N {\sc ii}] 6583 \AA, Na D, and Ca {\sc ii} H & K lines,
and blueshifted aborption lines of Na D, and K {\sc i} resonance lines.
Prominent differences between the 2003 and 1995-96 spectra are seen. The 2003
profiles of Na D, Ca II H & K are fit by a single Gaussian but in 1995-1996 two
Gaussians separated by about 200 km s$^{-1}$ were required. However, the He
{\sc i} broad emission lines are fit by a single Gaussian at all times; the
emitting He and Na-Ca atoms are probably not colocated. The C$_2$ Phillips 2-0
lines are detected as sharp absorption lines in 2003 indicating presence of gas
at 1300 K.The 2003 spectra show C {\sc i} sharp emission lines at minimum light
with a velocity changing in five days by about 20 km s$^{-1}$ when the velocity
of `metal' sharp lines is unchanged; the C {\sc i} emission may arise from
shock-heated gas. Spectra at maximum shows extended blue wings to strong lines
with the extension dependent on a line's lower excitation potential a signature
of stellar wind. Changes in the cores of the resonance lines of Al {\sc i} and
Na D and the Ca {\sc ii} IR lines suggest complex flow patterns near the
photosphere. The spectroscopic differences at the two mimima show the
importance of continued scrutiny of the declines of R CrB.",2006-05-09T07:23:47Z
Optical polarimetric monitoring of the type II-plateau SN 2005af,"Aims. Core-collapse supernovae may show significant polarization that implies
non-spherically symmetric explosions. We observed the type II-plateau SN 2005af
using optical polarimetry in order to verify whether any asphericity is present
in the supernova temporal evolution. Methods. We used the IAGPOL imaging
polarimeter to obtain optical linear polarization measurements in R (five
epochs) and V (one epoch) broadbands. Interstellar polarization was estimated
from the field stars in the CCD frames. The optical polarimetric monitoring
began around one month after the explosion and lasted ~30 days, between the
plateau and the early nebular phase. Results. The weighted mean observed
polarization in R band was [1.89 +/- 0.03]% at position angle (PA) 54 deg.
After foreground subtraction, the level of the average intrinsic polarization
for SN 2005af was ~0.5% with a slight enhancement during the plateau phase and
a decline at early nebular phase. A rotation in PA on a time scale of days was
also observed. The polarimetric evolution of SN 2005af in the observed epochs
is consistent with an overall asphericity of ~20% and an inclination of ~30
deg. Evidence for a more complex, evolving asphericity, possibly involving
clumps in the SN 2005af envelope, is found.",2006-04-25T00:18:10Z
"The Luminosity Function of Nearby Galaxy Clusters II: Redshifts and
  Luminosity Function for Galaxies in the Region of the Centaurus Cluster","We acquired spectra for a random sample of galaxies within a 0.83 square
degree region centered on the core of the Centaurus cluster. Radial velocities
were obtained for 225 galaxies to limiting magnitudes of V < 19.5. Of the
galaxies for which velocities were obtained, we find 35% to be member galaxies.
Of the 78 member galaxies, magnitudes range from 11.8 < V < 18.5 (-21.6 < M_{V}
< -14.9 for H_o = 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1) with a limiting central surface brightness
of \mu_o < 22.5 mag arcsec^-2. We constructed the cluster galaxy luminosity
function by using these spectroscopic results to calculate the expected
fraction of cluster members in each magnitude bin. The faint-end slope of the
luminosity function using this method is shallower than the one obtained using
a statistical method to correct for background galaxy contamination. We also
use the spectroscopy results to define surface brightness criteria to establish
membership for the full sample. Using these criteria, we find a luminosity
function very similar to the one constructed with the statistical background
correction. For both, we find a faint-end slope alpha ~ -1.4. Adjusting the
surface brightness membership criteria we find that the data are consistent
with a faint-end slope as shallow as -1.22 or as steep as -1.50. We describe in
this paper some of the limitations of using these methods for constructing the
galaxy luminosity function.",2006-03-19T00:50:27Z
"Japanese Virtual Observatory (JVO) as an advanced astronomical research
  enviroment","We present the design and implementation of the Japanese Virtual Observatory
(JVO) system. JVO is a portal site to various kinds of astronomical resources
distributed all over the world. We have developed five components for
constructing the portal: (1) registry, (2) data service, (3) workflow system,
(4) data analysis service (5) portal GUI. Registry services are used for
publishing and searching data services in the VO, and they are constructed
using an OAI-PMH metadata harvesting protocol and a SOAP web service protocol
so that VO standard architecture is applied. Data services are developed based
on the Astronomical Data Query Language (ADQL) which is an international VO
standard and an extension of the standard SQL. The toolkit for building the
ADQL-based service is released to the public on the JVO web site. The toolkit
also provides the protocol translation from a Simple Image Access Protocol
(SIAP) to ADQL protocol, so that both the VO standard service can be
constructed using our toolkit. In order to federate the distributed databases
and analysis services, we have designed a workflow language which is described
in XML and developed execution system of the workflow. We have succeeded to
connect to a hundred of data resources of the world as of April 2006. We have
applied this system to the study of QSO environment by federating a QSO
database, a Subaru Suprim-Cam database, and some analysis services such a
SExtractor and HyperZ web services. These experiences are described is this
paper.",2006-04-28T01:18:26Z
"Probing long-period companions to planetary hosts. VLT and CFHT near
  infrared coronographic imaging surveys","We present the results of a deep imaging survey of stars surrounded by
planets detected with the radial velocity technique. The purpose is to search
for and to characterize long-period stellar and substellar companions. The
sample contains a total of 26 stars, among which 6 exhibit additional radial
velocity drifts. We used NACO, at the ESO Very Large Telescope, and PUEO-KIR,
at the Candian French Hawaiian Telescope, to conduct a near-infrared
coronographic survey with adaptive optics of the faint circumstellar
environment of the planetary hosts. The domain investigated ranges between 0.1
to 15"" (i.e. about 3 to 500 AU, according to the mean distance of the sample).
The survey is sensitive to companions within the stellar and the substellar
domains, depending on the distance to the central stars and on the star
properties. The images of 14 stars do not reveal any companions once the field
objects are removed. 8 stars have close potential companions that need to be
re-observed within 1-2 years to check for physical companionship. 4 stars are
surrounded by faint objects which are confirmed or very probable companions.
The companion to HD13445 (Gliese 86) is already known. The HD196885 star is a
new close visual binary system with a high probability of being bound. The 2
newly discovered companions, HD1237 B and HD27442 B, share common proper
motions with the central stars. Orbital motion is detected for HD1237 B. HD1237
B is likely a low-mass M star, located at 70 AU (projected distance) from the
primary. HD27442 B is most probably a white dwarf companion located at about
240 AU (projected distance).",2006-06-07T19:48:21Z
The first Swift X-ray Flash: The faint afterglow of XRF 050215B,"We present the discovery of XRF 050215B and its afterglow. The burst was
detected by the Swift BAT during the check-out phase and observations with the
X-ray telescope began approximately 30 minutes after the burst. These
observations found a faint, slowly fading X-ray afterglow near the centre of
the error box as reported by the BAT. Infrared data, obtained at UKIRT after 10
hours also revealed a very faint K-band afterglow. The afterglow appear unusual
since it is very faint, especially in the infrared with K>20 only 9 hours post
burst. The X-ray and infrared lightcurves exhibit a slow, monotonic decay with
alpha=0.8 and no evidence for steepening associated with the jet break to 10
days post burst. We discuss possible explanations for the faintness and slow
decay in the context of present models for the production of X-ray Flashes.",2006-05-10T12:43:35Z
"Primordial He4 Abundance Constrains the Possible Time Variation of the
  Higgs Vacuum Expectation Value","We constrain the possible time variation of the Higgs vacuum expectation
value ($v$) by recent results on the primordial $^4He$ abundance ($Y_P$). For
that, we use an analytic approach which enables us to take important issues
into consideration, that have been ignored by previous works, like the
$v$-dependence of the relevant cross sections of deuterium production and
photodisintegration, including the full Klein- Nishina cross section.
Furthermore, we take a non-equilibrium Ansatz for the freeze-out concentration
of neutrons and protons and incorporate the latest results on the neutron
decay. Finally, we approximate the key-parameters of the primordial $^4He$
production (the mean lifetime of the free neutron and the binding energy of the
deuteron) by terms of $v\over v_0$ (where $v_0$ denotes the present theoretical
estimate). Eventually, we derive the relation $Y_P \simeq 0.2479 - 5.54
(\frac{v-v_0}{v_0})^2 - 0.808~ (\frac{v-v_0}{v_0})$ and the most stringent
limit on a possible time variation of $v$ is given by: $-5.4 \cdot 10^{-4} \leq
\frac{v-v_0}{v_0} \leq 4.4 \cdot 10^{-4}$.",2006-06-19T20:13:28Z
"Measuring proton energies and fluxes using EIT (SOHO) CCD areas outside
  the solar disk images","An indirect proton flux measuring tool based on discrimination of the energy
deposited by protons in 128 x 128 pixel EIT CCD areas outside the solar disk
images is presented. Single pixel intensity events are converted into proton
incident energy flux using modeled energy deposition curves for angles of
incidence 60 deg in four EIT spatial areas with different proton stopping
power. The extracted proton flux is corrected for both the loss of one-pixel
events in the range of angles of incidence as well as for the contribution to
the single pixel events resulting from scattered middle-energy protons
(low-energy or high-energy particles are stopped by the EIT components or pass
through them, accordingly). A simple geometrical approach was found and applied
to correct for a non-unique relation between the proton-associated CCD output
signal and the incident proton energy. With this geometrical approximation four
unique proton incident energy ranges were determined as 45--49, 145--154,
297--335, and 390--440 MeV. The indirect proton flux measuring tool has been
tested by comparing Solar Energetic Particles (SEP) flux temporal profiles
extracted from the EIT CCD frames and downloaded from the GOES database for the
Bastille Day (BD) of 2000 July 14 and the more recent 2005 January 20 events.
The SEP flux temporal profiles and proton spectra extracted from the EIT in the
relatively narrow energy ranges between 45 and 440 MeV reported here are
consistent with the related GOES profiles. The four additional EIT extracted
ranges provide higher energy resolution of the SEP data.",2006-04-20T16:43:49Z
Environment and the cosmic evolution of star formation,"We present a mark correlation analysis of the galaxies in the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey using weights provided by MOPED. The large size of the sample
permits statistically significant statements about how galaxies with different
metallicities and star formation histories are spatially correlated. Massive
objects formed a larger fraction of their stars at higher redshifts and over
shorter timescales than did less massive objects (sometimes called
down-sizing). We find that those galaxies which dominated the cosmic star
formation at z~3 are predominantly in clusters today, whereas galaxies which
dominate the star formation at z~0 inhabit substantially lower mass objects in
less dense regions today. Hence, our results indicate that star formation and
chemical enrichment occured first in the denser regions of the Universe, and
moved to less dense regions at later times.",2006-04-27T20:00:46Z
"Power Spectrum Analysis of Far-IR Background Fluctuations in 160 Micron
  Maps From the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer","We describe data reduction and analysis of fluctuations in the cosmic far-IR
background (CFIB) in observations with the Multiband Imaging Photometer for
Spitzer (MIPS) instrument 160 micron detectors. We analyzed observations of an
8.5 square degree region in the Lockman Hole, part of the largest low-cirrus
mapping observation with this instrument. We measured the power spectrum of the
CFIB in these observations by fitting a power law to the IR cirrus component,
the dominant foreground contaminant, and subtracting this cirrus signal. The
CFIB power spectrum in the range 0.2 arc min^{-1} <k< 0.5 arc min^{-1} is
consistent with previous measurements of a relatively flat component. However,
we find a large power excess at low k, which falls steeply to the flat
component in the range 0.03 arc min^{-1} <k< 0.1 arc min^{-1}. This low-k power
spectrum excess is consistent with predictions of a source clustering
""signature"". This is the first report of such a detection in the far-IR.",2006-04-25T04:14:25Z
Spectral line variability amplitudes in AGNs,"We present the results of a long-term variability campaign of very broad-line
AGNs with line widths broader than FWHM $>$ 5000 kms$^{-1}$. The main goal of
our investigation was to study whether the widths of the optical broad emission
lines are correlated with the optical intensity variations on timescales of
years. Our AGN sample consisted of 10 objects. We detected a significant
correlation between optical continuum variability amplitudes and H$\beta$
emission line widths (FWHM) and, to a lesser degree, between H$\beta$ line
intensity variations and H$\beta$ equivalent widths. We add the spectroscopic
data of variable AGNs from the literature to supplement our sample. The AGNs
from other optical variability campaigns with different line-widths helped to
improve the statistical significance of our very broad-line AGN sample. After
including the data on 35 additional galaxies, the correlation between optical
continuum variability amplitudes and H$\beta$ emission line widths becomes even
more significant and the probability that this is a random correlation drops to
0.7 percent.",2006-04-21T15:46:35Z
"Fragmentation of gravitationally unstable gaseous protoplanetary disks
  with radiative transfer","We report on the results of the first 3D SPH simulation of massive,
gravitationally unstable protoplanetary disks with radiative transfer. We adopt
a flux-limited diffusion scheme justified by the high opacity of most of the
disk. The optically thin surface of the disk cools as a blackbody. The disks
grow slowly in mass starting from a Toomre-stable initial condition to the
point at which they become marginally unstable. We find that gravitationally
bound clumps with masses close to a Jupiter mass can arise. Fragmentation
appears to be driven by vertical convective-like motions capable of
transporting the heat from the disk midplane to its surface on a timescale of
only about 40 years at 10 AU. A larger or smaller cooling efficiency of the
disk at the optically thin surface can promote or stifle fragmentation by
affecting the vertical temperature profile, which determines whether convection
can happen or not, and by regulating the accretion flow from optically thin
regions towards overdense regions. We also find that the chances of
fragmentation increase for a higher mean molecular weight $\mu$ since
compressional heating is reduced. Around a star with mass $1 M_{\odot}$ only
disks with $\mu \ge 2.4$, as expected for gas with a metallicity comparable to
solar or higher, fragment. This suggests that disk instability, like
core-accretion, should be more effective in forming gas giants at higher gas
metallicities, consistent with the observed correlation between metallicity of
the planet-hosting stars and frequency of planets",2006-06-15T16:58:30Z
On the Nature of Part Time Radio Pulsars,"The recent discovery of rotating radio transients and the quasi-periodicity
of pulsar activity in the radio pulsar PSR B1931$+$24 has challenged the
conventional theory of radio pulsar emission. Here we suggest that these
phenomena could be due to the interaction between the neutron star
magnetosphere and the surrounding debris disk. The pattern of pulsar emission
depends on whether the disk can penetrate the light cylinder and efficiently
quench the processes of particle production and acceleration inside the
magnetospheric gap. A precessing disk may naturally account for the
switch-on/off behavior in PSR B1931$+$24.",2006-06-21T07:42:36Z
"Detection of a 63 Degree Cold Stellar Stream in the Sloan Digital Sky
  Survey","We report on the detection in Sloan Digital Sky Survey data of a 63
degree-long tidal stream of stars, extending from Ursa Major to Cancer. The
stream has no obvious association with the orbit of any known cluster or
galaxy. The contrast of the detected stream is greatest when using a star count
filter that is matched to the color-magnitude distribution of stars in M 13,
which suggests that the stars making up the stream are old and metal poor. The
visible portion of the stream is very narrow and about 8.5 kpc above the
Galactic disk, suggesting that the progenitor is or was a globular cluster.
While the surface density of the stream varies considerably along its length,
its path on the sky is very smooth and uniform, showing no evidence of
perturbations by large mass concentrations in the nearby halo. While definitive
constraints cannot be established without velocity information, the stream's
projected path and estimates of its distance suggest that we are observing the
stream near the perigalacticon of its orbit.",2006-04-14T18:44:26Z
"A survey for nanodiamond features in the 3 micron spectra of Herbig
  Ae/Be stars","We have carried out a survey of 60 Herbig Ae/Be stars in the 3 micron
wavelength region in search for the rare spectral features at 3.43 and 3.53
micron. These features have been attributed to the presence of large, hot,
hydrogen-terminated nanodiamonds. Only two Herbig Ae/Be stars, HD 97048 and
Elias 3-1 are known to display both these features. We have obtained
medium-resolution spectra (R ~2500) with the ESO near-IR instrument ISAAC in
the 3.15-3.65 micron range. In our sample, no new examples of sources with
prominent nanodiamond features in their 3 micron spectra were discovered
(detection rate less than 4%). We report tentative 3.53 micron detections in
V921 Sco (=CD-42.11721), HD 163296 and T CrA. The sources which display the
nanodiamond features are not exceptional in the group of Herbig stars with
respect to disk properties, stellar characteristics, or disk and stellar
activity. Moreover, the nanodiamond sources are very different from each other
in terms of these parameters. We do not find evidence for a recent supernova in
the vicinity of any of the nanodiamond sources. We have analyzed the PAH 3.3
micron feature and the Pfund delta hydrogen emission line, two other spectral
features which occur in the 3 micron wavelength range. We reinforce the
conclusion of previous authors that flared-disk systems display significantly
more PAH emission than self-shadowed-disk sources. The Pf delta line detection
rate is higher in self-shadowed-disk sources than in the flared-disk systems.
We discuss the possible origin and paucity of the (nano)diamond features in
Herbig stars. Different creation mechanisms have been proposed in the
literature, amongst others in-situ and supernova-induced formation. Our data
set is inconclusive in proving or disproving either formation mechanism.",2006-06-27T12:28:39Z
"Exploring High-Velocity NH_3(6,6) Emission at the Center of our Galaxy","Using the NH\3 (6,6) transition, which samples dense ($\sim 10^{5}$)
molecular gas with an energy above ground of 412 K, we find hot gas at high
velocities (--142 to --210 km s$^{-1}$) associated with the central 2 pc of the
Galactic center. This material may be either infalling gas due to shocks or
tidal stripping, or possibly gas swept from the nuclear region. We identify two
high-velocity features, which we call the Southern Runner and the Cap, and
correlate these features with others detected in various molecular observations
of the Galactic center. The characteristic linewidths of the Southern Runner
and Cap, 10 -- 15 \kms, are similar to those of other hot Galactic center
clouds. The estimated H$_{2}$ masses of these clouds are 4$\times 10^{3}$
M$\sol$ and 2$\times 10^{3}$ M$\sol$, consistent with the masses of the western
streamer and northern ridge, NH\3 (6,6) emission features detected within the
central 10 pc at lower velocities. Three possible explanations for this
emission are discussed assuming that they lie at the Galactic center, including
sweeping by the supernova remnant Sgr A East, infall and/or shock from the
circumnuclear disk (CND), and stripping from the central rotating low-velocity
NH\3 (6,6) cloud.",2006-05-11T02:59:29Z
"On the consistency of the peculiar GRBs 060218 and 060614 with the Ep,i
  - Eiso correlation","We analyze and discuss the position of GRB 060218 and GRB 060614 in the Ep,i
- Eiso plane. GRB 060218 is important because of its similarity with GRB
980425, the proto-type event of the GRB-SN connection. While GRB 980425 is an
outlier of the Ep,i - Eiso correlation, we find that GRB 060218 is fully
consistent with it. This evidence, combined with the `chromatic' behavior of
the afterglow light curves, is at odds with the hypothesis that GRB 060218 was
a `standard' GRB seen off-axis and supports the existence of a class of truly
sub--energetic GRBs. GRB 060614 is a peculiar event not accompanied by a bright
Supernova. Based on published spectral information, we find that also this
event is consistent with the Ep,i - Eiso correlation. We discuss the
implications of our results for the rate of sub--energetic GRBs, the GRB/SN
connection and the properties of the newly discovered sub-class of long GRBs
not associated with bright Supernovae. We have included in our analysis other
recent GRBs with clear evidence (or clear no evidence) of associated SNe.",2006-07-07T19:14:29Z
"CCD Photometry of the globular cluster M2. RR Lyrae physical parameters
  and new variables","We report the results of CCD V and R photometry of the RR Lyrae stars in M2.
The periodicities of most variables are revised and new ephemerides are
calculated. Light curve decomposition of the RR Lyrae stars was carried out and
the corresponding mean physical parameters [Fe/H] = -1.47, Teff = 6276 K, log L
= 1.63 Lsun and Mv = 0.71 from nine RRab and [Fe/H] = -1.61, M = 0.54 Msun,
Teff = 7215 K, log L = 1.74 Lsun and Mv = 0.71 from two RRc stars were
calculated. A comparison of the radii obtained from the above luminosity and
temperature with predicted radii from nonlinear convective models is discussed.
The estimated mean distance to the cluster is 10.49 +- 0.15 kpc. These results
place M2 correctly in the general globular cluster sequences Oosterhoff type,
mass, luminosity and temperature, all as a function of the metallicity. Mean
relationships for M, log L/Lsun, Teff and Mv as a function of [Fe/H] for a
family of globular clusters are offered. These trends are consistent with
evolutionary and structural notions on the horizontal branch. Eight new
variables are reported.",2006-06-29T19:22:16Z
Formation of Primordial Stars in a LCDM Universe,"We study the formation of the first generation of stars in the standard cold
dark matter model, using a very high-resolution hydordynamic simulations. Our
simulation achieves a dynamic range of 10^{10} in length scale. With accurate
treatment of atomic and molecular physics, it allows us to study the
chemo-thermal evolution of primordial gas clouds to densities up to n =
10^{16}/cc without assuming any a priori equation of state; a six orders of
magnitudes improvement over previous three-dimensional calculations. All the
relevant atomic and molecular cooling and heating processes, including cooling
by collision-induced continuum emission, are implemented. For calculating
optically thick H2 cooling at high densities, we use the Sobolev method. To
examine possible gas fragmentation owing to thermal instability, we compute
explicitly the growth rate of isobaric perturbations. We show that the cloud
core does not fragment in either the low-density or high-density regimes. We
also show that the core remains stable against gravitational deformation and
fragmentation. We obtain an accurate gas mass accretion rate within a 10 Msun
innermost region around the protostar. The protostar is accreting the
surrounding hot gas at a rate of 0.001-0.01 Msun/yr. From these findings we
conclude that primordial stars formed in early minihalos are massive. We carry
out proto-stellar evolution calculations using the obtained accretion rate. The
resulting mass of the first star is M_ZAMS = 60-100 Msun, with the exact mass
dependent on the actual accretion rate.",2006-06-06T02:40:28Z
The Evolution of the ISM in the Mildly Disturbed Spiral Galaxy NGC 4647,"We present matched-resolution maps of HI and CO emission in the Virgo Cluster
spiral NGC 4647. The galaxy shows a mild kinematic disturbance in which one
side of the rotation curve flattens but the other side continues to rise. This
kinematic asymmetry is coupled with a dramatic asymmetry in the molecular gas
distribution but not in the atomic gas. An analysis of the gas column densities
and the interstellar pressure suggests that the H2/HI surface density ratio on
the east side of the galaxy is three times higher than expected from the
hydrostatic pressure contributed by the mass of the stellar disk. We discuss
the probable effects of ram pressure, gravitational interactions, and
asymmetric potentials on the interstellar medium and suggest it is likely that
a m=1 perturbation in the gravitational potential could be responsible for all
of the galaxy's features. Kinematic disturbances of the type seen here are
common, but the curious thing about NGC 4647 is that the molecular distribution
appears more disturbed than the HI distribution. Thus it is the combination of
the two gas phases that provides such interesting insight into the galaxy's

Atomic Carbon in APM 08279+5255 at z=3.91,"We present a detection of [CI] line emission in the lensed quasar APM
08279+5255 at z=3.91 using the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer. The [CI]
line velocity and width are similar to the values of previously detected high-J
CO and HCN lines in this source, suggesting that the emission from all of these
species arises from the same region. The apparent luminosity of the [CI] line
is L'(CI) = (3.1 +/- 0.4)x10^10 K km/s pc^2, which implies a neutral carbon
mass, M(CI) = (4.4+/-0.6)/m x10^7 M_sun, where m is the lensing magnification
factor. The [CI] line luminosity is consistent with the large molecular gas
mass inferred from the nuclear CO line luminosity ~10^11 /m M_sun. We also
present an upper limit on the H2O line luminosity in APM 08279+5255 of, L'(H2O)
< 1.8x10^10 K km/s pc^2 (3-sigma).",2006-07-12T20:21:36Z
X-ray nature of the LINER nuclear sources,"We report the results from an homogeneous analysis of the X-ray
(Chandra-ACIS) data available for a sample of 51 LINER galaxies selected from
the catalogue by Carrillo et al. (1999) and representative of the population of
bright LINER sources. The nuclear X-ray morphology has been classified
attending to their nuclear compactness in the hard band (4.5-8.0 keV) into 2
categories: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) candidates (with a clearly identified
unresolved nuclear source) and Starburst (SB) candidates (without a clear
nuclear source). 60% of the total sample are classified as AGNs, with a median
luminosity of LX(2-10 keV)=2.5 x 10^(40)erg/s, which is an order of magnitude
higher than that for SB-like nuclei. The spectral fitting allows to conclude
that most of the objects need a non-negligible power-law contribution. When no
spectral fitting can be performed (data with low signal-to-noise ratio), the
Color-Color diagrams allow us to roughly estimate physical parameters such as
column density, temperature of the thermal model or spectral index for a
power-law and therefore to better constrain the origin of the X-ray emission.
All together the X-ray morphology, the spectra and the Color-Color diagrams
allow us to conclude that a high percentage of LINER galaxies, at least ~60%,
could host AGN nuclei, although contributions from High Mass X-ray Binaries or
Ultra-luminous X-ray sources cannot be ruled out for some galaxies.",2006-05-24T14:47:15Z
Galaxy Formation and SN Feedback,"We present a Supernova (SN) feedback model that succeeds at describing the
chemical and energetic effects of SN explosions in galaxy formation
simulations. This new SN model has been coupled to GADGET-2 and works within a
new multiphase scheme which allows the description of a co-spatial mixture of
cold and hot interstellar medium phases.
  No ad hoc scale-dependent parameters are associated to these SN and
multiphase models making them particularly suited to studies of galaxy
formation in a cosmological framework. Our SN model succeeds not only in
setting a self-regulated star formation activity in galaxies but in triggering
collimated chemical-enriched galactic winds. The effects of winds vary with the
virial mass of the systems so that the smaller the galaxy, the larger the
fraction of swept away gas and the stronger the decrease in its star formation
activity. The fact that the fraction of ejected metals exceeds 60 per cent
regardless of mass, suggests that SN feedback can be the responsible mechanism
of the enrichment of the intergalactic medium to the observed levels.",2006-03-23T12:03:50Z
Dwarf Galaxies of the Local Group,"XMM-Newton and Chandra have ushered in a new era for the study of dwarf
galaxies in the Local Group. We provide an overview of the opportunities,
challenges, and some early results. The large number of background sources
relative to galaxy sources is a major theme. Despite this challenge, the
identification of counterparts has been possible, providing hints that the same
mechanisms producing X-ray sources in larger galaxies are active in dwarf
galaxies. A supersoft X-ray source within 2"" of the supermassive black hole in
M32 may be a remnant of the tidal disruption of a giant, although other
explanations cannot be ruled out.",2006-06-14T20:50:45Z
"The Shape, Multiplicity, and Evolution of Superclusters in LambdaCDM
  Cosmology","We determine the shape, multiplicity, size, and radial structure of
superclusters in the LambdaCDM concordance cosmology from z = 0 to z = 2.
Superclusters are defined as clusters of clusters in our large-scale
cosmological simulation. We find that superclusters are triaxial in shape; many
have flattened since early times to become nearly two-dimensional structures at
present, with a small fraction of filamentary systems. The size and
multiplicity functions are presented at different redshifts. Supercluster sizes
extend to scales of ~ 100 - 200 Mpc/h. The supercluster multiplicity (richness)
increases linearly with supercluster size. The density profile in superclusters
is approximately isothermal (~ R^{-2}) and steepens on larger scales. These
results can be used as a new test of the current cosmology when compared with
upcoming observations of large-scale surveys.",2006-03-02T21:00:02Z
"A sensitive survey for water maser emission towards Bok globules using
  the Robledo 70m antenna","We report the most sensitive water maser survey towards Bok globules to date,
using NASA's 70m antenna in Robledo de Chavela (Spain). We observed 207
positions within the CB catalog with a higher probability of harboring a young
star, using as selection criteria the presence of radio continuum emission
(from submillimeter to centimeter wavelengths), geometrical centers of
molecular outflows, peaks in maps of high-density gas tracers (NH3 or CS), and
IRAS point sources. We have obtained 7 maser detections, 6 of which (in CB 34,
CB 54, CB 65, CB 101, CB 199, and CB 232) are reported for the first time here.
Most of the water masers we detected are likely to be associated with young
stellar objects (YSOs), except for CB 101 (probably an evolved object) and CB
65 (uncertain nature). The water maser in CB 199 shows a relatively high shift
(~30 km/s) of its velocity centroid with respect to the cloud velocity, which
is unusual for low-mass YSOs. We speculate that high-velocity masers in this
kind of object could be related with episodes of energetic mass-loss in close
binaries. Alternatively, the maser in CB 199 could be pumped by a
protoplanetary or a young planetary nebula. CB 232 is the smallest Bok globule
(~0.6 pc) known to be associated with water maser emission, although it would
be superseded by the cases of CB 65 (~0.3 pc) and CB 199 (~0.5 pc) if their
association with YSOs is confirmed. All our selection criteria have
statistically compatible detection rates, except for IRAS sources, which tend
to be a somewhat worse predictor for the presence of maser emission.",2006-06-05T09:02:28Z
On the distance of GRO J1655-40,"We challenge the accepted distance of 3.2 kpc of GRO J1655-40. We present
VLT-UVES spectroscopic observations to estimate the absorption toward the
source, and determine a maximum distance of GRO J1655-40. We show that the
accepted value of 3.2 kpc is taken for granted by many authors. We retrieved in
the ESO archive UVES spectra taken in April 2004 when GRO J1655-40 was in
quiescence to determine the spectral type of the secondary star. For the first
time we build a flux-calibrated mean (UVES) spectrum of GRO J1655-40 and
compare its observed flux to that of five nearby stars of similar spectral
types. We strengthen our results with the traditional pair method, using
published photometric data of the comparison stars. We show that the distance
of 3.2 kpc is questionable. We determine a spectral type F6IV for the secondary
star. We demonstrate in details that the distance of GRO J1655-40 must be
smaller than 1.7 kpc. The runaway black hole GRO J1655-40 could be associated
with the open cluster NGC 6242 which is located at 1.0$\pm$0.1 kpc from the
Sun. At $D \leq$ 1.7 kpc the jets are not a superluminal, and GRO J1655-40
becomes one of the closest known black holes to the Sun.",2006-06-12T17:45:33Z
Spectral line variability amplitudes in AGNs,"We present the results of a long-term variability campaign of very broad-line
AGNs with line widths broader than FWHM $>$ 5000 kms$^{-1}$. The main goal of
our investigation was to study whether the widths of the optical broad emission
lines are correlated with the optical intensity variations on timescales of
years. Our AGN sample consisted of 10 objects. We detected a significant
correlation between optical continuum variability amplitudes and H$\beta$
emission line widths (FWHM) and, to a lesser degree, between H$\beta$ line
intensity variations and H$\beta$ equivalent widths. We add the spectroscopic
data of variable AGNs from the literature to supplement our sample. The AGNs
from other optical variability campaigns with different line-widths helped to
improve the statistical significance of our very broad-line AGN sample. After
including the data on 35 additional galaxies, the correlation between optical
continuum variability amplitudes and H$\beta$ emission line widths becomes even
more significant and the probability that this is a random correlation drops to
0.7 percent.",2006-04-21T15:46:35Z
The messy environment of Mrk 6,"In recent years it has become clear that understanding the absorption present
in AGN is essential given its bearing on unification models. We present the
most recent XMM-Newton observation of Mrk 6, with the goal of understanding the
nature and origin of the complex absorption intrinsic to this source. X-ray
spectral fitting shows that a simple warm absorption model provides an equally
good statistical representation of the CCD data as a partial covering model.
Furthermore, once the RGS data are included in the spectral fitting, the simple
warm absorber model provides a very good fit to the data, without increasing
the complexity of the model, in contrast with the partial covering model which
requires the addition of either a low metalicity (<0.03 solar) thermal plasma
or low temperature blackbody emission in order to provide a similar quality
fit. The warm absorber is also a considerably more natural way to explain the
variability observed in the X-ray absorbing column density between the previous
XMM-Newton observation and this one, requiring only a second, higher column
density, higher ionisation, absorber to be present during the previous
XMM-Newton observation. In comparison, the partial covering models which
requires moving, clumpy, material relatively close to the source that result in
two distinct lines of sight, with separate absorbing columns that each vary
considerably without any associated change in their covering fractions, in
order to explain the observed variability. We associate the warm absorber
either with an accretion disk wind with densities of ~10^9 /cm^3, or with an
ionised `skin' or atmosphere of the molecular torus with densities of ~10^3 -
10^5 /cm^3.",2006-05-18T12:53:30Z
"Contour binning: a new technique for spatially-resolved X-ray
  spectroscopy applied to Cassiopeia A","We present a new technique for choosing spatial regions for X-ray
spectroscopy, called ""contour binning"". The method chooses regions by following
contours on a smoothed image of the object. In addition we re-explore a simple
method for adaptively smoothing X-ray images according to the local count rate,
we term ""accumulative smoothing"", which is a generalisation of the method used
by FADAPT. The algorithms are tested by applying them to a simulated cluster
data set. We illustrate the techniques by using them on a 50 ks Chandra
observation of the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant. Generated maps of the object
showing abundances in eight different elements, absorbing column density,
temperature, ionisation timescale and velocity are presented. Tests show that
contour binning reproduces surface brightness considerably better than other
methods. It is particularly suited to objects with detailed spatial structure
such as supernova remnants and the cores of galaxy clusters, producing
aesthetically pleasing results.",2006-06-21T17:31:59Z
Snapping Supernovae at z>1.7,"We examine the utility of very high redshift Type Ia supernovae for cosmology
and systematic uncertainty control. Next generation space surveys such as the
Supernova/Acceleration Probe (SNAP) will obtain thousands of supernovae at
z>1.7, beyond the design redshift for which the supernovae will be exquisitely
characterized. We find that any z\gtrsim2 standard candles' use for
cosmological parameter estimation is quite modest and subject to pitfalls; we
examine gravitational lensing, redshift calibration, and contamination effects
in some detail. The very high redshift supernovae - both thermonuclear and core
collapse - will provide copious interesting information on star formation,
environment, and evolution. However, the new observational systematics that
must be faced, as well as the limited expansion of SN-parameter space afforded,
does not point to high value for 1.7<z<3 SNe Ia in controlling evolutionary
systematics relative to what SNAP can already achieve at z<1.7. Synergy with
observations from JWST and thirty meter class telescopes afford rich
opportunities for advances throughout astrophysics.",2006-07-03T20:00:35Z
Isotherms clustering in cosmic microwave background,"Since the strong clustering of luminous matter in the observable universe is
a consequence of an initial non-uniformity of the baryon-photon fluid in the
last scattering surface, an investigation of clustering of the isotherms in the
cosmic microwave background has been performed. The isotherms clustering has
been related to the baryon-photon fluid dynamics and the Taylor-microscale
Reynolds number of this motion is estimated to be $10^2$. 3-year WMAP cosmic
microwave background map has been used in this investigation.",2006-07-17T10:56:27Z
An Investigation of Be/X-ray Pulsars with OGLE-III Data,"We have studied five seasons of OGLE-III data for eight SMC Be/X-ray pulsars
for which no other survey data were available. We have determined orbital
periods for four of these binary systems, one of which also shows nonradial
pulsations. Optical identification of SMC X-2 is reconsidered, but no periods
were found for either of the two possible candidates.",2006-05-16T20:01:03Z
"Variable Very High Energy Gamma-ray Emission from the Microquasar LS I
  +61 303","Microquasars are binary star systems with relativistic radio-emitting jets.
They are potential sources of cosmic rays and laboratories for elucidating the
physics of relativistic jets. Here we report the detection of variable
gamma-ray emission above 100 gigaelectron volts from the microquasar LS I +61
303. Six orbital cycles were recorded. Several detections occur at a similar
orbital phase, suggesting the emission is periodic. The strongest gamma-ray
emission is not observed when the two stars are closest to one another,
implying a strong orbital modulation of the emission or the absorption
processes.",2006-05-22T08:43:03Z
A numerical study of non-gaussianity in the curvaton scenario,"We study the curvaton scenario using gauge-invariant second order
perturbation theory and solving the governing equations numerically. Focusing
on large scales we calculate the non-linearity parameter f_nl in the two-fluid
curvaton model and compare our results with previous analytical studies
employing the sudden decay approximation. We find good agreement of the two
approaches for large curvaton energy densities at curvaton decay, Omega_dec,
but significant differences of up to 10 percent for small Omega_dec.",2006-04-18T18:36:28Z
Why the cosmological constant is small and positive,"Within conventional big bang cosmology, it has proven to be very difficult to
understand why today's cosmological constant is so small. In this paper, we
show that a cyclic model of the universe can naturally incorporate a dynamical
mechanism that automatically relaxes the value of the cosmological constant,
taking account of contributions to the vacuum density at all energy scales.
Because the relaxation time grows exponentially as the vacuum density
decreases, nearly every volume of space spends an overwhelming majority of the
time at the stage when the cosmological constant is small and positive, as
observed today.",2006-05-06T15:36:30Z
Precision Measurement of Optical Pulsation using a Cherenkov Telescope,"During 2003, a camera designed to measure the optical pulsations of pulsars
was installed on a telescope of the H.E.S.S. array. The array is designed for
gamma-ray astronomy in the ~100 GeV - 100 TeV energy regime. The aims of this
exercise were two-fold: to prove the pulsar timing capabilities of H.E.S.S. on
all relevant time-scales, and to explore the possibility of performing
sensitive optical pulsar measurements using the ~100 m^2 mirror of a Cherenkov
telescope. Measurements of the Crab pulsar with this instrument demonstrate an
order of magnitude sensitivity improvement over previous attempts using
Cherenkov telescopes. Here we describe the design and performance of the system
and discuss design considerations for future instruments of this type.",2006-04-19T16:07:49Z
"Novae as a Mechanism for Producing Cavities around the Progenitors of SN
  2002ic and Other SNe Ia","We propose that a nova shell ejected from a recurrent nova progenitor system
created the evacuated region around the explosion center of SN 2002ic. In this
picture, periodic shell ejections due to nova explosions on a white dwarf sweep
up the slow wind from the binary companion, creating density variations and
instabilities that lead to structure in the circumstellar medium (CSM). Our
model naturally explains the observed gap between the supernova explosion
center and the CSM in SN 2002ic, accounts for the density variations observed
in the CSM, and resolves the coincidence problem of the timing of the explosion
of SN 2002ic with respect to the apparent cessation of mass-loss in the
progenitor system. We also consider such nova outburst sweeping as a generic
feature of Type Ia supernovae with recurrent nova progenitors.",2006-05-24T20:01:52Z
Gravitational lensing effects on the gamma-ray burst Hubble diagram,"Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) offer a potential way to extend the Hubble diagram to
very high redshifts and to constrain the nature of dark energy in a way
complementary to distant type Ia supernovae. However, gravitational lensing
systematically brightens distant GRBs through the magnification bias, in
addition to increasing the dispersions of distance measurements. We investigate
how the magnification bias limits the cosmological usage of GRBs. We perform
Monte-Carlo simulations of Swift GRBs assuming a cosmological constant
dominated universe and then constrain the dark energy equation of state
neglecting gravitational lens effects. The originally assumed model is
recovered with 68% confidence limit even when the dispersion of inferred
luminosities is comparable to that of type Ia supernovae. This implies that the
bias is not so drastic for Swift GRBs as to change constraints on dark energy
and its evolution. However, the precise degree of the bias in cosmological
parameter determinations depends strongly on the shape of the luminosity
function of GRBs. Therefore, an accurate determination of the shape of the
luminosity function is required to remove the effect of gravitational lensing
and to obtain an unbiased Hubble diagram.",2006-04-21T20:00:06Z
"Probing cosmological parameters with the CMB: Forecasts from full Monte
  Carlo simulations","The Fisher matrix formalism has in recent times become the standard method
for predicting the precision with which various cosmological parameters can be
extracted from future data. This approach is fast, and generally returns
accurate estimates for the parameter errors when the individual parameter
likelihoods approximate a Gaussian distribution. However, where Gaussianity is
not respected (due, for instance, to strong parameter degeneracies), the Fisher
matrix formalism loses its reliability. In this paper, we compare the results
of the Fisher matrix approach with those from Monte Carlo simulations. The
latter method is based on the publicly available CosmoMC code, but uses
synthetic realisations of data sets anticipated for future experiments. We
focus on prospective cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Planck
satellite, with or without CMB lensing information, and its implications for a
minimal cosmological scenario with eight parameters and an extended model with
eleven parameters. We show that in many cases, the projected sensitivities from
the Fisher matrix and the Monte Carlo methods differ significantly,
particularly in models with many parameters. Sensitivities to the neutrino mass
and the dark matter fraction are especially susceptible to change.",2006-06-09T17:55:02Z
"Single Field Inflation models allowed and ruled out by the three years
  WMAP data","We study the single field slow-roll inflation models that better fit the
available CMB and LSS data including the three years WMAP data: new inflation
and hybrid inflation. We study them as effective field theories in the
Ginsburg-Landau context: a trinomial potential turns out to be a simple and
well motivated model. The compute the spectral index n_s of the adiabatic
fluctuations, the ratio r of tensor to scalar fluctuations and the running
index d n_s/dln k, derive explicit formulae and provide relevant plots. In new
inflation, and for the three years WMAP central value n_s = 0.95, we predict
0.03<r<0.04 and -0.00070<d n_s/d ln k<-0.00055. In hybrid inflation, and for
n_s = 0.95, we predict r = 0.2 and dn_s/dln k=-0.001.We find in new inflation
n_s bounded from above by n_{smax} = 0.9615 and that r is a two valued function
of n_s in the interval 0.96<n_s<0.9615. In the first branch we find r<r_{max} =
0.1148.In hybrid inflation we find a critical value mu_{0 crit}^2 for the mass
parameter mu_0^2 of the field sigma coupled to the inflaton.For mu_0^2<
Lambda_0 M_{Pl}^2/192, hybrid inflation is ruled out by the WMAP three years
data since it yields n_s>1. Hybrid inflation for mu_0^2>Lambda_0 M_{Pl}^2/192
can fullfill all the present CMB+LSS data. Even if chaotic inflation predicts
n_s values compatible with the data, chaotic inflation is disfavoured since it
predicts a too high value for the ratio r=0.27. The model which best fits the
current data and which best prepares the way to the expected data r < 0.1, is
the trinomial potential with negative mass term: new inflation.",2006-04-06T15:48:18Z
Fluorescent Lyman-alpha Emission from Gas Near a QSO at Redshift 4.28,"We use integral field spectroscopy with the Gemini North Telescope to detect
probable fluorescent Ly-alpha emission from gas lying close to the luminous QSO
PSS 2155+1358 at redshift 4.28. The emission is most likely coming not from
primordial gas, but from a multi-phase, chemically enriched cloud of gas lying
about 50 kpc from the QSO. It appears to be associated with a highly ionised
associated absorber seen in the QSO spectrum. With the exception of this gas
cloud, the environment of the QSO is remarkably free of neutral hydrogen. We
also marginally detect Ly-alpha emission from a foreground sub-Damped-Ly-alpha
absorption-line system.",2006-05-19T01:06:00Z
From progenitor to afterlife,"The sequence of massive star supernova types IIP (plateau light curve), IIL
(linear light curve), IIb, IIn (narrow line), Ib, and Ic roughly represents a
sequence of increasing mass loss during the stellar evolution. The mass loss
affects the velocity distribution of the ejecta composition; in particular,
only the IIP's typically end up with H moving at low velocity. Radio and X-ray
observations of extragalactic supernovae show varying mass loss properties that
are in line with expectations for the progenitor stars. For young supernova
remnants, pulsar wind nebulae and circumstellar interaction provide probes of
the inner ejecta and higher velocity ejecta, respectively. Among the young
remnants, there is evidence for supernovae over a range of types, including
those that exploded with much of the H envelope present (Crab Nebula, 3C 58,
0540--69) and those that exploded after having lost most of their H envelope
(Cas A, G292.0+1.8).",2006-07-18T18:04:11Z
"The Origin Magnetars: the role of anisotropic neutron superfluid of
  neutron stars","We estimate the strength of the induced magnetic field due to the total
induced magnetic moment of the anisotropic ($^3PF^2$) neutron superfluid
interior of neutron stars. The induced magnetic field of the neutron stars is
found as follows. $B^{(in)} = \frac{\eta}{{T_7 - \eta}}B^{(0)}
,\begin{array}{*{20}c}{} & {\eta =} \ \end{array}\frac{{m(^3 P_2
)}}{{0.1m_{Sun}}}R_{NS,6}^{- 3} $ ($T_7$ denotes the interior temperature of
the neutron star in unit of 10$^7$ K). The induced magnetic field will
gradually increase with the temperature of the neutron star decreasing in their
late evolutionary stage. A magnetar may appear in a condition when $T_7 \to
\eta$. The upper limit of the induced magnetic field of $^3P^2$ superfluid is
$3.35 \time 10^{14} \eta$.",2006-07-11T07:48:26Z
Disk Evolution in Young Binaries: from Observations to Theory,"The formation of a binary system surrounded by disks is the most common
outcome of stellar formation. Hence studying and understanding the formation
and the evolution of binary systems and associated disks is a cornerstone of
star formation science. Moreover, since the components within binary systems
are coeval and the sizes of their disks are fixed by the tidal truncation of
their companion, binary systems provide an ideal ""laboratory"" in which to study
disk evolution under well defined boundary conditions.
  In this paper, we review observations of several inner disk diagnostics in
multiple systems, including hydrogen emission lines (indicative of ongoing
accretion), $K-L$ and $K-N$ color excesses (evidence of warm inner disks), and
polarization (indicative of the relative orientations of the disks around each
component). We examine to what degree these properties are correlated within
binary systems and how this degree of correlation depends on parameters such as
separation and binary mass ratio. These findings will be interpreted both in
terms of models that treat each disk as an isolated reservoir and those in
which the disks are subject to re-supply from some form of circumbinary
reservoir, the observational evidence for which we will also critically review.
The planet forming potential of multiple star systems is discussed in terms of
the relative lifetimes of disks around single stars, binary primaries and
binary secondaries. Finally, we summarize several potentially revealing
observational problems and future projects that could provide further insight
into disk evolution in the coming decade",2006-04-03T16:16:03Z
"Arc sensitivity to cluster ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures","We investigate how ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures separately
affect the ability of galaxy clusters to produce strong lensing events, i.e.
gravitational arcs, and how they influence the arc morphologies and fluxes.
This is important for those studies aiming, for example, at constraining
cosmological parameters from statistical lensing, or at determining the inner
structure of galaxy clusters through gravitational arcs. We do so by creating
two-dimensional gradually smoothed, differently elliptical and asymmetric
versions of some numerical models. On average, we find that the contributions
of ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures amount to ~40%, ~10% and ~30% of
the total strong lensing cross section, respectively. However, our analysis
shows that substructures play a more important role in less elliptical and
asymmetric clusters, even if located at large distances from the cluster
centers (~1Mpc/h). Conversely, their effect is less important in highly
asymmetric lenses. The morphology, position and flux of individual arcs are
strongly affected by the presence of substructures in the clusters. Removing
substructures on spatial scales <~50kpc/h, roughly corresponding to mass scales
<~5 10^{10}M_\odot/h, alters the image multiplicity of ~35% of the sources used
in the simulations and causes position shifts larger than 5'' for ~40% of the
arcs longer than 5''. We conclude that any model for cluster lens cannot
neglect the effects of ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures. On the other
hand, the high sensitivity of gravitational arcs to deviations from regular,
smooth and symmetric mass distributions suggests that strong gravitational
lensing is potentially a powerfull tool to measure the level of substructures
and asymmetries in clusters.",2006-05-31T21:59:49Z
Gamma-ray bursts and collisionless shocks,"Particle acceleration in collisionless shocks is believed to be responsible
for the production of cosmic-rays over a wide range of energies, from few GeV
to >10^{20}eV, as well as for the non-thermal emission of radiation from a wide
variety of high energy astrophysical sources. A theory of collisionless shocks
based on first principles does not, however, exist. Observations of gamma-ray
burst (GRB) ""afterglows"" provide a unique opportunity for diagnosing the
physics of relativistic collisionless shocks. Most GRBs are believed to be
associated with explosions of massive stars. Their ""afterglows,"" delayed low
energy emission following the prompt burst of gamma-rays, are well accounted
for by a model in which afterglow radiation is due to synchrotron emission of
electrons accelerated in relativistic collisionless shock waves driven by the
explosion into the surrounding plasma. Within the framework of this model, some
striking characteristics of collisionless relativistic shocks are implied.
These include the generation of downstream magnetic fields with energy density
exceeding that of the upstream field by ~8 orders of magnitude, the survival of
this strong field at distances ~10^{10} skin-depths downstream of the shock,
and the acceleration of particles to a power-law energy spectrum, d\log n/d\log
E ~ -2, possibly extending to 10^{20}eV. I review in this talk the
phenomenological considerations, based on which these characteristics are
inferred, and the challenges posed to our current models of particle
acceleration and magnetic field generation in collisionless shocks. Some recent
theoretical results derived based on the assumption of a self-similar shock
structure are briefly discussed.",2006-07-15T18:10:40Z
"Formation of Pillars at the Boundaries between H II Regions and
  Molecular Clouds","We investigate numerically the hydrodynamic instability of an ionization
front (IF) accelerating into a molecular cloud, with imposed initial
perturbations of different amplitudes. When the initial amplitude is small, the
imposed perturbation is completely stabilized and does not grow. When the
initial perturbation amplitude is large enough, roughly the ratio of the
initial amplitude to wavelength is greater than 0.02, portions of the IF
temporarily separate from the molecular cloud surface, locally decreasing the
ablation pressure. This causes the appearance of a large, warm HI region and
triggers nonlinear dynamics of the IF. The local difference of the ablation
pressure and acceleration enhances the appearance and growth of a multimode
perturbation. The stabilization usually seen at the IF in the linear regimes
does not work due to the mismatch of the modes of the perturbations at the
cloud surface and in density in HII region above the cloud surface. Molecular
pillars are observed in the late stages of the large amplitude perturbation
case. The velocity gradient in the pillars is in reasonably good agreement with
that observed in the Eagle Nebula. The initial perturbation is imposed in three
different ways: in density, in incident photon number flux, and in the surface
shape. All cases show both stabilization for a small initial perturbation and

The Dwarf Galaxy Population in Nearby Groups. The data,"We used V and I CCD photometry to search for low-surface brightness dwarf
galaxies (LSBD) in the central (<0.5 h^-1 Mpc) region of the groups NGC 6868,
NGC 5846, HCG 42 and the poor cluster IC 4765. Using the parameters given by
the exponential profile fit, we identified 80 LSBD candidates with magnitudes
17 < V < 22 mag and with colors V-I < 1.5 mag at the limiting isophote of 25.8
V mag/arcsec^2. The galaxies have mu0 > 22.5 V mag/arcsec^2, h > 1.5 arcsec,
and diameters larger than 1.2 h^-1 kpc. Twenty of the eighty galaxies are
extended LSB galaxies that were detected only on smoothed images, after masking
all high surface brightness objects. The completeness in the detection is ~80%
for galaxies with V<=20 and 22.5<mu0<24.5 V mag/arcsec^2, and below 50% at
fainter magnitudes and central surface brightnesses. In this last bin, the
completeness increases to ~80% when we search for galaxies in smoothed images
instead. The detected LSBD galaxies are highly concentrated towards the center
of the four groups in the inner 250 h^-1 kpc. The best fit power-law slope of
the surface density distribution is, on average, beta ~ -1.5 (R < 250 h^-1
kpc), in agreement with the values found for satellites dwarfs around isolated
E/S0 galaxies and in X-ray groups. The LSBD galaxies in the Mv-mu0 plane does
not show a clear correlation, suggesting that the correlation noted by other
studies could be produced by selection effects. The LSBD dwarf galaxies follow
a well defined color-magnitude relation, extending for more than ten magnitudes
(from bright ellipticals to faint dwarfs). A similar well defined
color-magnitude relation from giants to dwarfs is known to be valid for galaxy
clusters but it is the first time that it is demonstrated in the sparse
environments of groups. (Abridge)",2006-06-07T19:25:56Z
Microlensing variability in time-delay quasars,"We have searched for microlensing variability in the light curves of five
gravitationally lensed quasars with well-determined time delays: SBS 1520+530,
FBQ 0951+2635, RX J0911+0551, B1600+434 and HE 2149-2745. By comparing the
light curve of the leading image with a suitably time offset light curve of a
trailing image we find that two (SBS 1520+530 and FBQ 0951+2635) out of the
five quasars have significant long-term (years) and short-term (100 days)
brightness variations that may be attributed to microlensing.The short-term
variations may be due to nanolenses, relativistic hot or cold spots in the
quasar accretion disks, or coherent microlensing at large optical depth.",2006-07-07T11:00:41Z
Abundance analysis of cool extreme helium star: LSS 3378,"Abundance analysis of the cool extreme helium (EHe) star LSS 3378 is
presented. The abundance analysis is done using LTE line formation and LTE
model atmospheres constructed for EHe stars.
  The atmosphere of LSS 3378 shows evidence of H-burning, He-burning, and
s-process nucleosynthesis. The derived abundances of iron-peak and
alpha-elements indicate absence of selective fractionation or any other
processes that can distort chemical composition of these elements. Hence, the
Fe abundance (log epsilon(Fe) = 6.1) is adopted as an initial metallicity
indicator. The measured abundances of LSS 3378 are compared with those of R
Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars and with rest of the EHe stars as a group.",2006-04-03T11:57:10Z
Halos and voids in a multifractal model of cosmic structure,"On the one hand, the large scale structure of matter is arguably scale
invariant, and, on the other hand, halos and voids are recognized as prominent
features of that structure. To unify both approaches, we propose to model the
dark matter distribution as a set of fractal distributions of halos of
different kinds. This model relies on the concept of multifractal as the most
general scaling distribution and on a plausible notion of halo as a singular
mass concentration in a multifractal. Voids arise as complementary to halos,
namely, as formed by regular mass depletions. To provide halos with definite
size and masses, we coarse-grain the dark matter distribution, using the length
given by the lower cutoff to scaling. This allows us to relate the halo mass
function to the multifractal spectrum. Hence, we find that a log-normal model
of the mass distribution nicely fits in this picture and, moreover, the
Press-Schechter mass function can be recovered as a bifractal limit.
  To support our model of fractal distributions of halos, we perform a
numerical study of the distribution produced in cosmological N-body
simulations. In the Virgo L-CDM GIF2 simulation, we indeed find fractal
distributions of halos with various dimensions and a halo mass function of
bifractal type. However, this mass function is not of Press-Schechter's type,
and we interprete it instead as caused by the undersampling of the distribution
at the scale of halos, due to discretization.",2006-04-10T17:15:13Z
The Evolution of Outflow-Envelope Interactions in Low-Mass Protostars,"We present multi-line and continuum observations of the circumstellar
environment within 10^4 AU of a sample of protostars to investigate how the
effects of outflows on their immediate environment changes over time. 12CO(1-0)
emission probes the high-velocity molecular outflows near the protostars and
demonstrate that the outflow opening angle widens as the nascent star evolves.
Maps of the 13CO(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) outflow emission show that protostellar
winds erode the circumstellar envelope through the entrainment of the outer
envelope gas. The spatial and velocity distribution of the dense circumstellar
envelope, as well as its mass, is traced by the C18O(1-0) emission and also
displays evolutionary changes. We show that outflows are largely responsible
for these changes, and propose an empirical model for the evolution of
outflow-envelope interactions. In addition, some of the outflows in our sample
appear to affect the chemical composition of the surrounding environment,
enhancing the HCO+ abundance. Overall, our results confirm that outflows play a
major role in the star formation process through their strong physical and
chemical impacts on the environments of the young protostars.",2006-05-04T20:55:39Z
"An XMM-Newton view of the young open cluster NGC 6231 -- II. The OB star
  population","In this second paper, we pursue the analysis of the 180 ks XMM-Newton
campaign towards the young open cluster NGC 6231 and we focus on its rich OB
star population. We present a literature-based census of the OB stars in the
field of view with more than one hundred objects, among which 30% can be
associated with an X-ray source. All the O-type stars are detected in the X-ray
domain as soft and reasonably strong emitters. In the 0.5-10.0 keV band, their
X-ray luminosities scale with their bolometric luminosities as $\log
L_\mathrm{X} - \log L_\mathrm{bol}=-6.912\pm0.153$. Such a scaling law holds in
the soft (0.5-1.0 keV) and intermediate (1.0-2.5 keV) bands but breaks down in
the hard band. While the two colliding wind binaries in our sample clearly
deviate from this scheme, the remaining O-type objects show a very limited
dispersion (40% or 20% according to whether `cool' dwarfs are included or not),
much smaller than that obtained from previous studies. At our detection
threshold and within our sample, the sole identified mechanism that produces
significant modulations in the O star X-ray emission is related to wind
interaction. The intrinsic X-ray emission of non-peculiar O-type stars seems
thus constant for a given star and the level of its X-ray emission is
accurately related to the its luminosity or, equivalently, to its wind
properties. Among B-type stars, the detection rate is only about 25% in the
sub-type range B0-B4 and remains mostly uniform throughout the different
sub-populations while it drops significantly at later sub-types. The associated
X-ray spectra are harder than those of O-type stars. Our analysis points
towards the detected emission being associated with a physical PMS companion

Coma revealed as an extended hard X-rays source by INTEGRAL IBIS/ISGRI,"Aims. We report the INTEGRAL/IBIS observations of the Coma Cluster in the
hard X-ray/soft-ray domain. Methods. Since the Coma Cluster appears as an
extended source, its global intensity and significance cannot be directly
extracted with standard coded mask analysis. We used the method of imaging the
extended sources with a coded mask telescope developed by Renaud et al. (2006).
Results. The imaging capabilities and the sensitivity of the IBIS/ISGRI coded
mask instrument allows us to identify for the first time the site of the
emission above ~ 15 keV. We have studied the Coma Cluster morphology in the
18-30keV band and found that it follows the prediction based on X-ray
observations.We also bring constraints on the non-thermal mechanism
contribution at higher energies.",2006-06-06T11:44:17Z
An XMM-Newton Observation of the Massive Edge-on Sb Galaxy NGC 2613,"We present an XMM-Newton observation of the massive edge-on Sb galaxy NGC
2613. We discover that this galaxy contains a deeply embedded active nucleus
with a 0.3-10 keV luminosity of 3.3x10^40 erg/s and a line-of-sight absorption
column of 1.2x10^23 cm^-2. Within the 25 mag/arcsec^2 optical B-band isophote
of the galaxy, we detect an additional 4 sources with an accumulated luminosity
of 4.3x10^39 erg/s. The bulk of the unresolved X-ray emission spatially follows
the near-infrared (NIR) K-band surface brightness distribution; the luminosity
ratio L_X/L_K ~ 8x10^-4 is consistent with that inferred from galactic discrete
sources. This X-ray-NIR association and the compatibility of the X-ray spectral
fit with the expected spectrum of a population of discrete sources suggest that
low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are the most likely emitters of the unresolved
emission in the disk region. The remaining unresolved emission is primarily due
to extraplanar hot gas. The luminosity of this gas is at least a factor of 10
less than that predicted by recent simulations of intergalactic gas accretion
by such a massive galaxy with a circular rotation speed V_c ~ 304 km/s^2 (Toft
et al. 2002). Instead, we find that the extraplanar hot gas most likely
represents discrete extensions away from the disk, including two
``bubble-like'' features on either side of the nucleus. These extensions appear
to correlate with radio continuum emission and, energetically, can be easily
explained by outflows from the galactic disk.",2006-06-21T23:07:07Z
Black-Hole Accretion Disc as an Analogue Gravity Model,"We formulate and solve the equations governing the transonic behaviour of a
general relativistic black-hole accretion disc with non-zero advection
velocity. We demonstrate that a relativistic Rankine-Hugoniot shock may form
leading to the formation of accretion powered outflow. We show that the
critical points of transonic discs generally do not coincide with the
corresponding sonic points. The collection of such sonic points forms an
axisymmetric hypersurface, generators of which are the acoustic null geodesics,
i.e. the phonon trajectories. Such a surface is shown to be identical with an
acoustic event horizon. The acoustic surface gravity and the corresponding
analogue horizon temperature $T_{AH}$ at the acoustic horizon are then computed
in terms of fundamental accretion parameters. Physically, the analogue
temperature is associated with the thermal phonon radiation analogous to the
Hawking radiation of the black-hole horizon.Thus, an axisymmetric black-hole
accretion disc is established as a natural example of the classical analogue
gravity model, for which two kinds of horizon exist simultaneously. We have
shown that for some values of astrophysically relevant accretion parameters,
the analogue temperature exceeds the corresponding Hawking temperature. We
point out that acoustic {\it white holes} can also be generated for a
multi-transonic black-hole accretion with a shock. Such a white hole, produced
at the shock, is always flanked by two acoustic black holes generated at the
inner and the outer sonic points. Finally, we discuss possible applications of
our work to other astrophysical events which may exhibit analogue effects.",2006-04-21T20:12:21Z
Lyman Alpha Constraints on Very Low Luminosity AGN,"Recent surveys have detected Lya emission from z=4.5-6.5 at luminosities as
low as 10^41 erg/s. There is good evidence that low numbers of AGN are among
observed faint Lya emitters. Combining these observations with an empirical
relation between the intrinsic Lya and B-band luminosities of AGN, we obtain an
upper limit on the number density of AGN with absolute magnitudes M_B=[-16,-19]
at z=4.5-6.5. These AGN are up to two orders of magnitude fainter than those
discovered in the Chandra Deep Field, resulting in the faintest observational
constraints to date at these redshifts. At z=4.5, the powerlaw slope of the
very faint end of the luminosity function of AGN is shallower than the slope
observed at lower redshifts, beta <1.6, at the 98% confidence level. In fact,
we find marginal evidence that the luminosity function rises with luminosity,
corresponding to a powerlaw slope beta <0, at magnitudes fainter than M_B~-20
(75% confidence level). These results suggest either that accretion onto lower
mass black holes is less efficient than onto their more massive counterparts,
or that the number of black holes powering AGN with M_B >-20 is lower than
expected from the M_BH-sigma relation by one-two orders of magnitude.
Extrapolating from reverberation-mapping studies suggests that these black
holes would have M_BH=10^6-10^7 Msun. To facilitate the identification of AGN
among observed Lya emitters, we derive observational properties of faint AGN in
the Lya line, as well as in the X-ray and optical bands.",2006-06-14T01:14:06Z
"Analysis of the dust evolution in the circumstellar disks of TTauri
  stars","We present a compositional analysis of 8-13um spectra of 32 young stellar
objects (YSOs). Our sample consists of 5 intermediate-mass stars and 27
low-mass stars. While the spectra and first scientific results have already
been published by Przygodda et al. (2003) and Kessler-Silacci et al. (2004) we
perform a more detailed analysis of the 10um silicate feature. In our analysis
we assume that this emission feature can be represented by a linear
superposition of the wavelength-dependent opacity $\kappa_{\rm abs}(\lambda)$
describing the optical properties of silicate grains with different chemical
composition, structure, and grain size. The determination of an adequate
fitting equation is another goal of this study. Using a restricted number of
fitting parameters we investigate which silicate species are necessary for the
compositional fitting. Particles with radii of 0.1um- and 1.5um consisting of
amorphous olivine and pyroxene, forsterite, enstatite, and quartz have been
considered. Only compact, homogeneous dust grains have been used in the
presented fitting procedures. In this context we show that acceptable fitting
results can also be achieved if emission properties of porous silicate grains
are considered instead. Although some previous studies give reasons for the
similarity between the dust in circumstellar disks of TTauri stars and Herbig
Ae/Be stars, a quantitative comparison has been missing, so far. Therefore, we
conclude with a discussion of the results of a 10um spectroscopic survey of van
Boekel et al. (2005) who focus on Herbig Ae/Be stars, the higher mass
counterparts of T Tauri stars and draw comparisons to this and other studies.
We find that the results of our study of T Tauri systems partly agree with
previous studies of Herbig Ae/Be stars.",2006-04-04T13:13:41Z
Optimal Image Reconstruction in Radio Interferometry,"We introduce a method for analyzing radio interferometry data which produces
maps which are optimal in the Bayesian sense of maximum posterior probability
density, given certain prior assumptions. It is similar to maximum entropy
techniques, but with an exact accounting of the multiplicity instead of the
usual approximation involving Stirling's formula. It also incorporates an Occam
factor, automatically limiting the effective amount of detail in the map to
that justified by the data. We use Gibbs sampling to determine, to any desired
degree of accuracy, the multi-dimensional posterior density distribution. From
this we can construct a mean posterior map and other measures of the posterior
density, including confidence limits on any well-defined function of the
posterior map.",2006-04-14T18:19:17Z
"The Rest-frame Optical Colors of 99,000 SDSS Galaxies","We synthesize the rest-frame Stroemgren colors using SDSS spectra for 99,088
galaxies selected from Data Release 1. This narrow-band ~200 AA photometric
system (uz, vz, bz, yz), first designed for the determination of effective
temperature, metallicity and gravity of stars, measures the continuum spectral
slope of galaxies in the rest-frame 3200-5800 AA wavelength range. Galaxies
form a remarkably narrow locus (~0.03 mag) in the resulting color-color
diagram. The Bruzual & Charlot population synthesis models suggest that the
position of a galaxy along this locus is controlled by a degenerate combination
of metallicity and age of the dominant stellar population. Galaxy distribution
along the locus is bimodal, with the local minimum corresponding to an ~1 Gyr
old single stellar population. The position perpendicular to the locus is
independent of metallicity and age, and reflects the galaxy's dust content, as
implied by both the models and the statistics of IRAS detections. A comparison
of this locus with the galaxy locus in the H_delta-D_n(4000) diagram, utilized
by Kauffmann et al. (2003) to estimate stellar masses, reveals a tight
correlation, although the two analyzed spectral ranges barely overlap. Overall,
the galaxy spectral energy distribution in the entire UV to near-IR range can
be described as a single-parameter family with an accuracy of 0.1 mag, or
better. This nearly one-dimensional distribution of galaxies in the
multi-dimensional space of measured parameters strongly supports the conclusion
of Yip et al. (2004), based on a principal component analysis, that SDSS galaxy
spectra can be described by a small number of eigenspectra. Apparently, the
contributions of stellar populations that dominate the optical emission from
galaxies are combined in a simple and well-defined way.",2006-06-14T18:58:37Z
The Sun's Interior Metallicity Constrained by Neutrinos,"Observed solar neutrino fluxes are employed to constrain the interior
composition of the Sun. Including the effects of neutrino flavor mixing, the
results from Homestake, Sudbury, and Gallium experiments constrain the Mg, Si,
and Fe abundances in the solar interior to be within a factor 0.89 to 1.34 of
the surface values with 68% confidence. If the O and/or Ne abundances are
increased in the interior to resolve helioseismic discrepancies with recent
standard solar models, then the nominal interior Mg, Si, and Fe abundances are
constrained to a range of 0.83 to 1.24 relative to the surface. Additional
research is needed to determine whether the Sun's interior is metal poor
relative to its surface.",2006-05-25T15:40:52Z
"Evolution of Photosynthesis and Biospheric Oxygenation Contingent Upon
  Nitrogen Fixation?","How photosynthesis by Precambrian cyanobacteria oxygenated Earth's biosphere
remains incompletely understood. Here it is argued that the oxic transition,
which took place between approximately 2.3 and 0.5 Gyr ago, required a great
proliferation of cyanobacteria, and this in turn depended on their ability to
fix nitrogen via the nitrogenase enzyme system. However, the ability to fix
nitrogen was not a panacea, and the rate of biospheric oxygenation may still
have been affected by nitrogen constraints on cyanobacterial expansion.
Evidence is presented for why cyanobacteria probably have a great need for
fixed nitrogen than other prokaryotes, underscoring the importance of their
ability to fix nitrogen. The connection between nitrogen fixation and the
evolution of photosynthesis is demonstrated by the similarities between
nitrogenase and enzymes critical for the biosynthesis of (bacterio)chlorophyll.
It is hypothesized that biospheric oxygenation would not have occurred if the
emergence of cyanobacteria had not been preceded by the evolution of nitrogen
fixation, and if these organisms had not also acquired the ability to fix
nitrogen at the beginning of or very early in their history. The evolution of
nitrogen fixation also appears to have been a precondition for the evolution of
(bacterio)chlorophyll-based photosynthesis. Given that some form of chlorophyll
is obligatory for true photosynthesis, and its light absorption and chemical
properties make it a ""universal pigment,"" it may be predicted that the
evolution of nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis are also closely linked on
other Earth- like planets.",2006-05-12T01:12:48Z
Remarks on Rapid vs. Slow Star Formation,"We discuss problems with some observational estimates indicating long
protostellar core lifetimes and large stellar age spreads in molecular clouds.
We also point out some additional observational constraints which suggest that
protostellar cores do not have long lifetimes before collapsing. For external
galaxies, we argue that the widths of spiral arms does not imply a long
star-formation process, since the formation of massive stars will disrupt
molecular clouds, move material around, compress it in other regions which
produce new star-forming clouds. Thus, it seems unavoidable that this cyclical
process will result in an extended period of enhanced star formation, which
does not represent the survival time of any individual molecular cloud. We
argue that the rapid star formation indicated observationally is also easier to
understand theoretically than the traditional scenario of slow quasi-static
contraction with ambipolar diffusion.",2006-05-10T17:59:58Z
Annihilation Emission from the Galactic Black Hole,"Both diffuse high energy gamma-rays and an extended electron-positron
annihilation line emission have been observed in the Galactic Center (GC)
region. Although X-ray observations indicate that the galactic black hole Sgr
A$^*$ is inactive now, we suggest that Sgr A$^*$ can become active when a
captured star is tidally disrupted and matter is accreted into the black hole.
As a consequence the galactic black hole could be a powerful source of
relativistic protons. We are able to explain the current observed diffuse
gamma-rays and the very detailed 511 keV annihilation line of secondary
positrons by $p-p$ collisions of such protons, with appropriate injection times
and energy. Relativistic protons could have been injected into the ambient
material if the black hole captured a 50M$_\odot$ star at several tens million
years ago. An alternative possibility is that the black hole continues to
capture stars with $\sim$1M$_\odot$ every hundred thousand years. Secondary
positrons produced by $p-p$ collisions at energies $\ga 30$ MeV are cooled down
to thermal energies by Coulomb collisions, and annihilate in the warm neutral
and ionized phases of the interstellar medium with temperatures about several
eV, because the annihilation cross-section reaches its maximum at these
temperatures. It takes about ten million years for the positrons to cool down
to thermal temperatures so they can diffuse into a very large extended region
around the Galactic center. A much more recent star capture may be also able to
account for recent TeV observations within 10 pc of the galactic center as well
as for the unidentified GeV gamma-ray sources found by EGRET at GC. The
spectral difference between the GeV flux and the TeV flux could be explained
naturally in this model as well.",2006-03-24T03:21:41Z
"GRB 060218/SN 2006aj: Prompt Emission from Inverse-Compton Scattering of
  Shock Breakout Thermal Photons","The gamma-ray burst (GRB) 060218/SN 2006aj is a peculiar event, with the
second lowest redshift, low luminosity, long duration, chromatic lightcurve
features, and in particular, the presence of a thermal component in the X-ray
and UV-optical spectra. Thanks to detailed temporal and spectral coverage of
the {\em Swift} observatory, the abundant data allow the GRB prompt emission to
be modelled in great detail for the first time. The low flux of prompt
UV/optical emission disfavors the conventional internal shock/synchrotron
radiation models, which generally predict strong UV/optical emission. Here we
show that the unusual prompt emission of GRB 060218 can be produced by
inverse-Compton scattering of shock-accelerated relativistic electrons off the
detected thermal photons. A pair of (forward plus reverse) shocks form when a
relativistic outflow interacts with a preexisting slower shell. The observed
gamma-ray emission and X-ray emission arise from the reverse-shocked and
forward-shocked regions, respectively. A fit to the data requires an initially
increasing outflow luminosity, which is consistent with the prediction of the
popular collapsar model.",2006-04-24T23:33:16Z
Mira B Rejuvenated,"Recent ultraviolet spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Far
Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) satellites demonstrate that UV line
and continuum fluxes observed from Mira B are increasing back towards the
levels that the International Ultraviolet Explorer observed in 1979-1980 and
1990-1995, after having been found in a very low state by HST and FUSE in
1999-2001. The UV emission is associated with accretion of material onto Mira B
from Mira A's massive wind, so the variability is presumably due to variations
in accretion rate. From wind absorption features, we estimate a Mira B mass
loss rate of 2.5e-12 M_sun/yr, indicating that Mira B's wind has increased in
strength along with the accretion rate. The UV variability may be associated
with a previously reported 14-year periodicity in Mira B's optical emission.",2006-06-19T19:33:44Z
Unveiling Hidden Patterns in CMB Anisotropy Maps,"Bianchi VII_h models have been recently proposed to explain potential
anomalies in the CMB anisotropy as observed by WMAP. We investigate the
violation of statistical isotropy due to an embedded Bianchi VII_h templates in
the CMB anisotropy maps to determine whether the existence of a hidden Bianchi
template in the WMAP data is consistent with the previous null detection of the
bipolar power spectrum in the WMAP first year maps. We argue that although
correcting the WMAP maps for the Bianchi template may explain some features in
the WMAP data it may cause other anomalies such as preferred directions leading
to detectable levels of violation of statistical isotropy in the Bianchi
corrected maps. We compute the bipolar power spectrum for the low density
Bianchi VII_h models embedded in the background CMB anisotropy maps with the
power spectrum that have been shown in recent literature to best fit the first
year WMAP data. By examining statistical isotropy of these maps, we put a limit
of {\sigma/H}_0 < 2.77E-10 (99% CL) on the shear parameter in Bianchi VII_h
models.",2006-04-13T14:12:49Z
Constraints on the cosmological density parameters and cosmic topology,"A nontrivial topology of the spatial section of the universe is an
observable, which can be probed for all locally homogeneous and isotropic
universes, without any assumption on the cosmological density parameters. We
discuss how one can use this observable to set constraints on the density
parameters of the Universe by using a specific spatial topology along with type
Ia supenovae and X-ray gas mass fraction data sets.",2006-05-09T01:41:44Z
"Confronting Dark Energy Models with Astrophysical Data: Non-Equilibrium
  vs. Conventional Cosmologies","We discuss fits of cosmological dark energy models to the available data on
high-redshift supernovae. We consider a conventional model with Cold Dark
Matter and a cosmological constant (LambdaCDM), a model invoking super-horizon
perturbations (SHCDM) and models based on Liouville strings in which dark
energy is provided by a rolling dilaton field (Q-cosmology). We show that a
complete treatment of Q-cosmology requires a careful discussion of
non-equilibrium situations (off-shell effects). The two main high-redshift
supernova data sets give compatible constraints on LambdaCDM and the other
models. We recover the well-known result that LambdaCDM fits very well the
combined supernova data sets, as does the super-horizon model. We discuss the
model-dependent off-shell corrections to the Q-cosmology model that are
relevant to the supernova data, and show that this model fits the data equally
well. This analysis could be extended to other aspects of cosmological
phenomenology, in particular to the CMB and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, which
have so far been treated using on-shell models.",2006-04-12T13:24:00Z
"Solar Mean Magnetic Field Near the Surface and its Variation During a
  Cycle","The unsigned mean magnetic field characterizes the magnetic energy settled in
the region near the solar surface. It is one of the determinant ingredients
that govern the turbulence in the photosphere, and the magnetic heating of
upper layers. The acoustic eigenmodes are directly sensitive to this mean
magnetic energy, via the magnetic pressure, and thanks to their trajectories
sweeping entirely this region. We use the local-wave formalism to calculate the
p-mode frequencies of the Saclay seismic solar model. Then, by comparing them
to the LOWL observed frequencies, the l-independent differences (up to 40
microHz) can be attributed to the existence of a magnetic pressure that
modifies the pressure, the density and the sound speed, taking also into
account the additional Alfven speed. A profile of unsigned mean magnetic field
is deduced, increasing from zero at the surface to 2.5e4 G, 5600 km deeper.
Next, by applying the same method, the l-independent variations in frequency
due the solar cycle (up to 0.4 microHz) is used to deduce the change of the
magnetic profile. This change presents two distinctive parts: a plateau of only
2-3 G from the surface down to 2100 km, and a very narrow peak of 55 G, 220 km
thick, right at the surface. Due to the non-linear effect of the magnetic
field, comparing only the frequencies between minimum and maximum activity is
not sufficient to deduce the magnetic variation. The additional knowledge of
the magnetic field at minimum activity is necessary. If the latter is ignored,
an extra variation of up to 130 G would be found. Finally, our results are
compared to magnetic field estimates by other helioseismic and spectroscopic
methods.",2006-08-04T12:28:05Z
"Mid-Infrared Source Multiplicity within Hot Molecular Cores traced by
  Methanol Masers","We present high resolution, mid-infrared images toward three hot molecular
cores signposted by methanol maser emission; G173.49+2.42 (S231, S233IR),
G188.95+0.89 (S252, AFGL-5180) and G192.60-0.05 (S255IR). Each of the cores was
targeted with Michelle on Gemini North using 5 filters from 7.9 to 18.5
microns. We find each contains both large regions of extended emission and
multiple, luminous point sources which, from their extremely red colours
(F[18.5]/F[7.9] >= 3), appear to be embedded young stellar objects. The closest
angular separations of the point sources in the three regions are 0.79, 1.00
and 3.33 arcseconds corresponding to linear separations of 1,700, 1,800 and
6,000AU respectively. The methanol maser emission is found closest to the
brightest MIR point source (within the assumed 1 arcsecond pointing accuracy).
Mass and luminosity estimates for the sources range from 3-22 Msol and
50-40,000 Lsol. Assuming the MIR sources are embedded objects and the observed
gas mass provides the bulk of the reservoir from which the stars formed, it is
difficult to generate the observed distributions for the most massive cluster
members from the gas in the cores using a standard form of the IMF.",2006-04-12T00:09:30Z
Cosmic Ray Scattering in Compressible Turbulence,"We study the scattering of low-energy Cosmic Rays (CRs) in a turbulent,
compressive MHD fluid. We show that compressible MHD modes -- fast or slow
waves with wave lengths smaller than CR mean free paths induce cyclotron
instability in CRs. The instability feeds the new small-scale Alfvenic wave
component with wave vectors mostly along magnetic field, which is not a part of
the MHD turbulence cascade. This new component gives feedback on the
instability through decreasing the CR mean free path. We show that the ambient
turbulence fully suppresses the instability at large scales, while wave
steepening constrains the amplitude of the waves at small scales. We provide
the energy spectrum of the plane-parallel Alfvenic component and calculate mean
free paths of CRs as a function of their energy. We find that for the typical
parameters of turbulence in the interstellar medium and in the intercluster
medium the new Alfvenic component provides the scattering of the low energy CRs
that exceeds the direct resonance scattering by MHD modes. This solves the
problem of insufficient scattering of low-energy CRs in the turbulent
interstellar or intracluster medium that was reported in the literature.",2006-06-29T20:00:06Z
"The 2dF-SDSS LRG and QSO survey: Evolution of the Luminosity Function of
  Luminous Red Galaxies to z=0.6","We present new measurements of the luminosity function (LF) of Luminous Red
Galaxies (LRGs) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the 2dF-SDSS LRG
and Quasar (2SLAQ) survey. We have carefully quantified, and corrected for,
uncertainties in the K and evolutionary corrections, differences in the colour
selection methods, and the effects of photometric errors, thus ensuring we are
studying the same galaxy population in both surveys. Using a limited subset of
6326 SDSS LRGs (with 0.17<z<0.24) and 1725 2SLAQ LRGs (with 0.5 <z<0.6), for
which the matching colour selection is most reliable, we find no evidence for
any additional evolution in the LRG LF, over this redshift range, beyond that
expected from a simple passive evolution model. This lack of additional
evolution is quantified using the comoving luminosity density of SDSS and 2SLAQ
LRGs, brighter than M_r - 5logh = -22.5, which are 2.51+/-0.03 x 10^-7 L_sun
Mpc^-3 and 2.44+/-0.15 x 10^-7 L_sun Mpc^-3 respectively (<10% uncertainty). We
compare our LFs to the COMBO-17 data and find excellent agreement over the same
redshift range. Together, these surveys show no evidence for additional
evolution (beyond passive) in the LF of LRGs brighter than M_r - 5logh = -21
(or brighter than L*). We test our SDSS and 2SLAQ LFs against a simple ``dry
merger'' model for the evolution of massive red galaxies and find that at least
half of the LRGs at z=0.2 must already have been well-assembled (with more than
half their stellar mass) by z=0.6. This limit is barely consistent with recent
results from semi-analytical models of galaxy evolution.",2006-07-27T20:01:03Z
"Determinations of temperature and density for solar-like Stars using Si
  XI soft X-ray emission lines","We study temperature and density sensitivities of ratios of Si XI soft X-ray
emission lines, in the wavelength range of 43--54\AA . The typical temperature
of the formation of the analyzed lines is around 1.6~MK, which makes this
analysis complementary to the analysis of He-like triplets being sensitive to
hotter plasma. We present theoretical calculations and compare them with ratios
obtained from high-resolution X-ray spectra of five solar-like stars: Procyon,
$\alpha$ Cen A$&$B, $\epsilon$ Eri, and Capella. We find that our results are
in good agreement with results obtained by other authors through different
diagnostics, namely the analysis of density- and temperature-sensitive He-like
triplet lines. We further estimate the coronal pressure and filling factors
from Si~XI lines in this study.",2006-06-13T01:03:10Z
"An Observational Perspective of Low Mass Dense Cores II: Evolution
  towards the Initial Mass Function","We review the properties of low mass dense molecular cloud cores, including
starless, prestellar, and Class 0 protostellar cores, as derived from
observations. In particular we discuss them in the context of the current
debate surrounding the formation and evolution of cores. There exist several
families of model scenarios to explain this evolution (with many variations of
each) that can be thought of as a continuum of models lying between two extreme
paradigms for the star and core formation process. At one extreme there is the
dynamic, turbulent picture, while at the other extreme there is a slow,
quasi-static vision of core evolution. In the latter view the magnetic field
plays a dominant role, and it may also play some role in the former picture.
Polarization and Zeeman measurements indicate that some, if not all, cores
contain a significant magnetic field. Wide-field surveys constrain the
timescales of the core formation and evolution processes, as well as the
statistical distribution of core masses. The former indicates that prestellar
cores typically live for 2--5 free-fall times, while the latter seems to
determine the stellar initial mass function. In addition, multiple surveys
allow one to compare core properties in different regions. From this it appears
that aspects of different models may be relevant to different star-forming
regions, depending on the environment. Prestellar cores in cluster-forming
regions are smaller in radius and have higher column densities, by up to an
order of magnitude, than isolated prestellar cores. This is probably due to the
fact that in cluster-forming regions the prestellar cores are formed by
fragmentation of larger, more turbulent cluster-forming cores, which in turn
form as a result of strong external compression.",2006-03-17T16:41:26Z
First Year Performance of The IceCube Neutrino Telescope,"The first sensors of the IceCube neutrino observatory were deployed at the
South Pole during the austral summer of 2004-05 and have been producing data
since February 2005. One string of 60 sensors buried in the ice and a surface
array of 8 ice Cherenkov tanks took data until December 2005 when deployment of
the next set of strings and tanks began. We have analyzed these data,
demonstrating that the performance of the system meets or exceeds design
requirements. Times are determined across the whole array to a relative
precision of better than 3 nanoseconds, allowing reconstruction of muon tracks
and light bursts in the ice, of air-showers in the surface array and of events
seen in coincidence by surface and deep-ice detectors separated by up to 2.5
km.",2006-04-20T23:25:06Z
The Age-Metallicity Relation of the SMC,"The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is the only dwarf galaxy in the Local Group
known to have formed and preserved populous star clusters continuously over the
past 12 Gyr. These clusters provide a unique, closely spaced set of single-age,
single-metallicity tracers for a detailed study of the SMC's age-metallicity
relation. Spectroscopic metallicity measurements, however, exist only for 6 of
its clusters. Here we present metallicities for 7 additional SMC clusters based
on Ca II triplet observations. The total sample comprises clusters spanning an
age range of 12 Gyr. Complemented by age estimates from literature these
objects provide us with a well-sampled, well-defined age-metallicity relation.
We compare our first results with the chemical evolution history of the SMC in
terms of a simple closed box model. We find that the general trend is well
reproduced by this model.",2006-07-04T10:20:58Z
"Variability and multi-periodic oscillations in the X-ray light curve of
  the classical nova V4743 Sgr","The classical nova V4743 Sgr was observed with XMM-Newton for about 10 hours
on April 4 2003, 6.5 months after optical maximum. At this time, this nova had
become the brightest supersoft X-ray source ever observed. We present the
results of a time series analysis performed on the X-ray light curve obtained
in this observation, and in a previous shorter observation done with Chandra 16
days earlier. Intense variability, with amplitude as large as 40% of the total
flux, was observed both times. Similarities can be found between the two
observations in the structure of the variations. Most of the variability is
well represented as a combination of oscillations at a set of discrete
frequencies lower than 1.7 mHz. At least five frequencies are constant over the
16 day time interval between the two observations. We suggest that a periods in
the power spectrum of both light curves at the frequency of 0.75 mHz and its
first harmonic are related to the spin period of the white dwarf in the system,
and that other observed frequencies are signatures of nonradial white dwarf
pulsations. A possible signal with a 24000 sec period is also found in the
XMM-Newton light curve: a cycle and a half are clearly identified. This period
is consistent with the 24278 s periodicity discovered in the optical light
curve of the source and thought to be the orbital period of the nova binary
system.",2006-07-07T23:51:13Z
Modified Newtonian Dynamics as an extra dimensional effect,"Modified Newtonian dynamics can be considered as an effect derived from a
squeezable extra dimension space. The third law of Newtonian dynamics can be
managed to remain valid in the 5-space. The critical acceleration parameter
$a_0$ appears naturally as the bulk acceleration that has to do with the
expanding universe in this setup. A simple toy model is presented in this
Letter to show that consistent theory can be built with the help of the extra
dimensional space.",2006-03-13T16:24:24Z
"Dependence of radio halo properties on star formation activity and
  galaxy mass","We investigate the relation between the existence and size of radio halos,
which are believed to be created by star formation (SF) related energy input
into the interstellar medium, and other galaxy properties, most importantly
star formation activity and galaxy mass. Based on radio continuum and H-alpha
observations of a sample of seven late-type spiral galaxies we find a direct,
linear correlation of the radial extent of gaseous halos on the size of the
actively star-forming parts of the galaxy disks. Data of a larger sample of 22
galaxies indicate that the threshold energy input rate into the disk ISM per
unit surface area for the creation of a gaseous halo depends on the mass
surface density of the galaxy, in the sense that a higher threshold must be
surpassed for galaxies with a higher surface density. Because of the good
prediction of the existence of a radio halo from these two parameters, we
conclude that they are important, albeit not the only contributors. The
compactness of the SF-related energy input is also found to be a relevant
factor. Galaxies with relatively compact SF distributions are more likely to
have gaseous halos than others with more widespread SF activity. These results
quantify the so-called ""break-out"" condition for matter to escape from galaxy
disks, as used in all current models of the interstellar medium and first
defined by Norman and Ikeuchi (1989).",2006-07-06T10:41:56Z
"Filaments, Bubbles, and Weak Shocks in the Gaseous Atmosphere of M87","We present the first results from a 500 ksec Chandra ACIS-I observation of
M87. At soft energies (0.5-1.0 keV), we detect filamentary structures
associated with the eastern and southwestern X-ray and radio arms. Many
filaments are spatially resolved with widths of ~300 pc. This filamentary
structure is particularly striking in the eastern arm where we suggest the
filaments are outer edges of a series of plasma-filled, buoyant bubbles whose
ages differ by ~6 x 10^6 years. These X-ray structures may be influenced by
magnetic filamentation. At hard energies (3.5-7.5 keV), we detect a nearly
circular ring of outer radius 2.8' (13 kpc) which provides an unambiguous
signature of a weak shock, driven by an outburst from the SMBH. The density
rise in the shock is ~1.3 (Mach number, M~1.2). The observed spectral hardening
in the ring corresponds to a temperature rise T_shock / T_0 ~ 1.2, or M~1.2, in
agreement with the Mach number derived independently from the gas density.
Thus, for the first time, we detect gas temperature and density jumps
associated with a classical shock in the atmosphere around a supermassive black
hole. We also detect two additional surface brightness edges and pressure
enhancements at radii of ~0.6' and ~1'. The ~0.6' feature may be
over-pressurized thermal gas surrounding the relativistic plasma in the radio
cocoon, the ``piston'', produced by the current episode of AGN activity. The
over-pressurized gas is surrounded by a cool gas shell. The ~1' feature may be
an additional weak shock from a secondary outburst. In an earlier episode, the
``piston'' was responsible for driving the 2.8' shock.",2006-04-27T20:35:41Z
Transfer matrices for magnetized CMB anisotropies,"Large-scale magnetic fields can affect scalar cosmological perturbations
whose evolution is described in the conformally Newtonian gauge and within the
tight coupling approximation. The magnetized curvature perturbations present
after matter radiation equality (and prior to decoupling) are computed in terms
of an appropriate transfer matrix allowing a general estimate of the
Sachs-Wolfe plateau. From the observation that CMB initial conditions should be
(predominantly) adiabatic, the contribution of the magnetic field intensity can
be constrained.",2006-04-02T17:55:24Z
An Optically Dark GRB Observed by HETE-2: GRB 051022,"GRB 051022 was detected at 13:07:58 on 22 October 2005 by HETE-2. The
location of GRB 051022 was determined immediately by the flight localization
system. This burst contains multiple pulses and has a rather long duration of
about 190 seconds. The detections of candidate X-ray and radio afterglows were
reported, whereas no optical afterglow was found. The optical spectroscopic
observations of the host galaxy revealed the redshift z = 0.8. Using the data
derived by HETE-2 observation of the prompt emission, we found the absorption
N_H = 8.8 -2.9/+3.1 x 10^22 cm^-2 and the visual extinction A_V = 49 -16/+17
mag in the host galaxy. If this is the case, no detection of any optical
transient would be quite reasonable. The absorption derived by the Swift XRT
observations of the afterglow is fully consistent with those obtained from the
early HETE-2 observation of the prompt emission. Our analysis implies an
interpretation that the absorbing medium could be outside external shock at R ~
10^16 cm, which may be a dusty molecular cloud.",2006-05-17T04:14:11Z
Dynamic Alignment and Exact Scaling Laws in MHD Turbulence,"Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is pervasive in astrophysical systems.
Recent high-resolution numerical simulations suggest that the energy spectrum
of strong incompressible MHD turbulence is $E(k_{\perp})\propto
k_{\perp}^{-3/2}$. So far, there has been no phenomenological theory that
simultaneously explains this spectrum and satisfies the exact analytic
relations for MHD turbulence due to Politano & Pouquet. Indeed, the
Politano-Pouquet relations are often invoked to suggest that the spectrum of
MHD turbulence instead has the Kolmogorov scaling -5/3. Using geometrical
arguments and numerical tests, here we analyze this seeming contradiction and
demonstrate that the -3/2 scaling and the Politano-Pouquet relations are
reconciled by the phenomenon of scale-dependent dynamic alignment that was
recently discovered in MHD turbulence.",2006-05-09T13:36:14Z
"Dynamical Expansion of Ionization and Dissociation Front around a
  Massive Star : A Starburst Mechanism","We quantitatively examine the significance of star formation triggered in the
swept-up shell around an expanding HII region. If the swept-up molecular gas is
sufficiently massive, new OB stars massive enough to repeat the triggering
process will form in the shell. We determine the lower limit (M_thr) for the
mass of the star that sweeps up the molecular gas, where at least one new star
with mass M_* > M_thr forms after the shell fragmentation. To calculate the
threshold stellar mass, M_thr, we examine how massive molecular shells can form
around various central stars, by performing detailed numerical radiation
hydrodynamics calculations. The mass of the photodissociated gas is generally
larger than the mass of the photoionized gas. However, the swept-up molecular
mass exceeds the photodissociated mass with a higher-mass star of M_* > 20
Msun. The accumulated molecular mass generally increases with the stellar mass,
and amounts to 10^{4-5} Msun for M_* > 20 Msun with an ambient density of n
\sim 100/cc. The threshold stellar mass is M_thr \sim 18 Msun with the
star-formation efficiency of \epsilon \sim 0.1 and n \sim 100/cc. We examine
the generality of this mode of run-away triggering for different sets of
parameters, and found that M_thr \sim 15-20 Msun in various situations. If the
ambient density is too high or the star-formation efficiency is too low, the
triggering is not run-away, but a single event.",2006-07-26T09:37:39Z
The Status of VHE Gamma-Ray Astronomy,"This paper presents a summary of the status of the field of very high-energy
(VHE) gamma-ray astronomy, as of early 2006. The paper is based on the
Rapporteur Talk given at the 29th International Cosmic Ray Conference in Pune,
India (ICRC 2005). It covers astrophysical results from observations made by
high-energy and very high-energy telescopes operating at photon energies above
1 GeV. The majority of recent observations in this field have been made by
ground-based telescopes using the atmospheric Cherenkov or air shower
techniques.",2006-05-08T03:44:47Z
"The Kinematic and Plasma Properties of X-ray Knots in Cassiopeia A from
  the Chandra HETGS","We present high-resolution X-ray spectra from the young supernova remnant Cas
A using a 70-ks observation taken by the Chandra High Energy Transmission
Grating Spectrometer (HETGS). Line emission, dominated by Si and S ions, is
used for high-resolution spectral analysis of many bright, narrow regions of
Cas A to examine their kinematics and plasma state. These data allow a 3D
reconstruction using the unprecedented X-ray kinematic results: we derive
unambiguous Doppler shifts for these selected regions, with values ranging
between -2500 and +4000 km/s. Plasma diagnostics of these regions, derived from
line ratios of resolved He-like triplet lines and H-like lines of Si, indicate
temperatures largely around 1 keV, which we model as O-rich reverse-shocked
ejecta. The ionization age also does not vary considerably over these regions
of the remnant. The gratings analysis was complemented by the non-dispersed
spectra from the same dataset, which provided information on emission measure
and elemental abundances for the selected Cas A regions. The derived electron
density of X-ray emitting ejecta varies from 20 to 200 cm^{-3}. The measured
abundances of Mg, Si, S and Ca are consistent with O being the dominant element
in the Cas A plasma. With a diameter of 5 arcmin, Cas A is the largest source
observed with the HETGS to date. We, therefore, describe the technique we use
and some of the challenges we face in the HETGS data reduction from such an
extended, complex object.",2006-05-03T01:47:07Z
The evolution of massive stars in the context of V838 Monocerotis,"The aim of this paper is to look at the evolution of massive stars in order
to determine whether or not the progenitor of V838 Mon may be a massive star.
In the first part of this paper, the evolution of massive stars around solar
metallicity is described, especially the evolution in the Hertzsprung-Russell
(HR) diagram. Then, using the observational constraints, the probable
progenitors (and their evolution) are described. Using models of single stars,
no progenitor can be found amongst massive stars that can satisfy all the
observational constraints. Wolf-Rayet stars (stars with initial masses above
about 30 solar masses, which have lost their hydrogen rich envelopes) could
explain 10 to 100 solar masses of circumstellar material but they are very
luminous (L > 100,000 solar luminosities). Main sequence stars crossing the HR
diagram and becoming red supergiants (RSG) can have very low effective
temperatures but take thousands of years to cross over. Be stars (fast rotating
stars with a mass around 10 solar masses), which form disk or B stars accreting
matter from a binary companion of a similar mass would need to be compared in
detail with the observational constraints. In the future, there will hopefully
be further observational constraints on the models coming from the mass and
nature (interstellar or circumstellar) of the material producing the light echo
and from a frequency estimate of spectacular objects such as V838 Mon.",2006-07-25T12:38:04Z
The 1-1000 micron SEDs of far-infrared galaxies,"Galaxies selected at 170um by the ISO FIRBACK survey represent the brightest
\~10% of the Cosmic Infrared Background. Examining their nature in detail is
therefore crucial for constraining models of galaxy evolution. Here we combine
Spitzer archival data with previous near-IR, far-IR, and sub-mm observations of
a representative sample of 22 FIRBACK galaxies spanning three orders of
magnitude in infrared luminosity. We fit a flexible, multi-component, empirical
SED model of star-forming galaxies designed to model the entire ~1-1000um
wavelength range. The fits are performed with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
approach, allowing for meaningful uncertainties to be derived. This approach
also highlights degeneracies such as between Td and beta, which we discuss in
detail. From these fits and standard relations we derive: L_IR, L_PAH, SFR,
tau_V, M_star, M_dust, Td, and beta. We look at a variety of correlations
between these and combinations thereof in order to examine the physical nature
of these galaxies. Our conclusions are supplemented by morphological
examination of the sources, and comparison with local samples. We find the bulk
of our sample to be consistent with fairly standard size and mass disk galaxies
with somewhat enhanced star-formation relative to local spirals, but likely not
bona fide starbursts. A few higher-z LIGs and ULIGs are also present, but
contrary to expectation, they are weak mid-IR emitters and overall are
consistent with star-formation over an extended cold region rather than
concentrated in the nuclear regions. We discuss the implications of this study
for understanding populations detected at other wavelengths, such as the bright
850um SCUBA sources or the faint Spitzer 24um sources.",2006-03-22T19:34:25Z
"Statistical Analysis of Point-like Sources in Chandra Galactic Center
  Survey","{\it Chandra} Galactic Center Survey detected $\sim 800$ X-ray point-like
sources in the $2^{\circ} \times 0.8^{\circ}$ sky region around the Galactic
Center. In this paper, we study the spatial and luminosity distributions of
these sources according to their spectral properties. Fourteen bright sources
detected are used to fit jointly an absorbed power-law model, from which the
power-law photon index is determined to be $\sim$2.5. Assuming that all other
sources have the same power-law form, the relation between hardness ratio and
HI column density $N_H$ is used to estimate the $N_H$ values for all sources.
Monte Carlo simulations show that these sources are more likely concentrated in
the Galactic center region, rather than distributed throughout the Galactic
disk. We also find that the luminosities of the sources are positively
correlated with their HI column densities, i.e. a more luminous source has a
higher HI column density. From this relation, we suggest that the X-ray
luminosity comes from the interaction between an isolated old neutron star and
interstellar medium (mainly dense molecular clouds). Using the standard Bondi
accretion theory and the statistical information of molecular clouds in the
Galactic center, we confirm this positive correlation and calculate the
luminosity range in this scenario, which is consistent with the observation
($10^{32}\sim 10^{35}$ ergs s$^{-1}$).",2006-06-20T11:50:12Z
Circumstellar Emission from Type Ib and Ic Supernovae,"The presumed Wolf-Rayet star progenitors of Type Ib/c supernovae have fast,
low density winds and the shock waves generated by the supernova interaction
with the wind are not expected to be radiative at typical times of observation.
The injected energy spectrum of radio emitting electrons typically has an
observed index p=3, which is suggestive of acceleration in cosmic ray dominated
shocks. The early, absorbed part of the radio light curves can be attributed to
synchrotron self-absorption, which leads to constraints on the magnetic field
in the emitting region and on the circumstellar density. The range of
circumstellar densities inferred from the radio emission is somewhat broader
than that for Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars, if similar efficiencies of synchrotron
emission are assumed in the extragalactic supernovae. For the observed and
expected ranges of circumstellar densities to roughly overlap, a high
efficiency of magnetic field production in the shocked region is required
(epsilon_B ~ 0.1). For the expected densities around a Wolf-Rayet star, a
nonthermal mechanism is generally required to explain the observed X-ray
luminosities of Type Ib/c supernovae. Although the inverse Compton mechanism
can explain the observed X-ray emission from SN 2002ap if the wind parameters
are taken from the radio model, the mechanism is not promising for other
supernovae unless the postshock magnetic energy density is much smaller than
the electron energy density. In some cases another mechanism is definitely
needed and we suggest that it is X-ray synchrotron emission in a case where the
shock wave is cosmic ray dominated so that the electron energy spectrum
flattens at high energy. More comprehensive X-ray observations of a Type Ib/c
supernova are needed to determine whether this suggestion is correct.",2006-07-10T15:33:53Z
On the Nature of Part Time Radio Pulsars,"The recent discovery of rotating radio transients and the quasi-periodicity
of pulsar activity in the radio pulsar PSR B1931$+$24 has challenged the
conventional theory of radio pulsar emission. Here we suggest that these
phenomena could be due to the interaction between the neutron star
magnetosphere and the surrounding debris disk. The pattern of pulsar emission
depends on whether the disk can penetrate the light cylinder and efficiently
quench the processes of particle production and acceleration inside the
magnetospheric gap. A precessing disk may naturally account for the
switch-on/off behavior in PSR B1931$+$24.",2006-06-21T07:42:36Z
Multi-colour Imaging of Ultra-compact Objects in the Fornax Cluster,"Ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) are a new type of galaxy we have
discovered in the central region of the Fornax and Virgo clusters. Unresolved
in ground-based imaging, UCDs have spectra typical of old stellar systems.
Ninety-two have been found in Fornax, making them the most numerous galaxy type
in the cluster. Here we present multicolour (u'g'r'i'z') imaging of the central
region of the Fornax Cluster using the CTIO 4m Mosaic Telescope. The
colour-magnitude relation for bright UCDs is qualitatively consistent with UCDs
being the stripped nuclei of dE,Ns. However at faint magnitudes, GCs and UCDs
cannot be distinguished by colour alone. High resolution spectroscopy to
measure their internal velocity dispersions and metallicities, is needed to
distinguish between GCs and UCDs.",2006-05-19T21:47:53Z
"Adaptive Optics Spectroscopy of the [Fe II] Outflows from HL Tauri and
  RW Aurigae","We present new results of [Fe II] 1.644-micron spectroscopy toward the jets
from HL Tau and RW Aur carried out with the Subaru Telescope combined with the
adaptive optics system. We observed the regions within 2"" - 3"" from the stars
with the sub-arcsecond resolutions of 0.""5 and 0.""2 for HL Tau and RW Aur,
respectively. In addition to the strong, high velocity emission extended along
each jet, we detected a blueshifted low velocity emission feature seen as a
wing or shoulder of the high velocity emission at each stellar position.
Detailed analysis shows that the position-velocity diagrams (PVDs) of HL Tau
and RW Aur show a characteristic similar to those of the cold disk wind and
X-wind models in that the [Fe II] line width is broad in the vicinity of the
stellar position and is narrower at the extended jet. A closer comparison
suggests, however, that the disk wind model tends to have too large line width
at the jet while the X-wind model has excess emission on the redshifted side at
the stellar position. The narrow velocity width with symmetric line profiles of
the observed high velocity emission supports an X-wind type model where the
launching region is localized in a small radial range, while the low velocity
emission located away from the star favors the presence of a disk wind. The [Fe
II] emission from the HL Tau jet shows a gap of 0.""8 between the redshifted jet
and the star, indicating the presence of an optically thick disk of ~ 160 AU in
radius. The [Fe II] emission from the RW Aur jet shows a marked drop from the
redshifted peak at Y ~ -0.""2 toward the star, suggesting that its disk radius
is smaller than 40 AU.",2006-06-24T00:34:44Z
Deuterium enhancement in H3+ in prestellar cores,"Deuterium enhancement of monodeuterated species has been recognized for more
than 30 years as a result of the chemical fractionation that results from the
difference in zero point energies of deuterated and hydrogenated molecules. The
key reaction is the deuteron exchange in the reaction between HD, the reservoir
of deuterium in dark interstellar clouds, and the H3+ molecular ion, leading to
the production of the H2D+ molecule, and the low temperature in dark
interstellar clouds favors this production. Furthermore, the presence of
multiply deuterated species have incited our group to proceed further and
consider the subsequent reaction of H2D+ with HD, leading to D2H+ (first
detected by Vastel et al. 2004), which can further react with HD to produce
D3+. In prestellar cores, where CO was found to be depleted (Bacmann et al.
2003), this production should be increased, as CO would normally destroy H3+.
The first model including D2H+ and D3+ (Roberts, Herbst & Millar 2003)
predicted that these molecules should be as abundant as H2D+ (see contribution
by H. Roberts). The first detection of the D2H+ was made possible by the recent
laboratory measurement by Hirao & Amano (2003) for the frequency of the
fundamental line of the para-D2H+ (see contribution by T. Amano). Here we
present observations of H2D+ and D2H+ towards a sample of dark clouds and
prestellar cores and show how the distribution of ortho-H2D+ (1_1,0-1_1,1) can
trace the deuterium factory in prestellar cores. We also present how future
instrumentation will improve our knowledge concerning the deuterium enhancement
of H3+.",2006-05-04T14:05:54Z
"The CMB Initial Data and Fundamental Operator Quantization of General
  Relativity","The observational data on CMB radiation revealed that our Universe can be an
ordinary physical object moving with respect to the Earth observer with the
occasional initial data. This fact allows us to apply the theory of irreducible
unitary representations of the Poincare group in order to describe the Universe

"Diffraction Limited Imaging Spectroscopy of the SgrA* Region using
  OSIRIS, a new Keck Instrument","We present diffraction limited spectroscopic observations of an infrared
flare associated with the radio source SgrA*. These are the first results
obtained with OSIRIS, the new facility infrared imaging spectrograph for the
Keck Observatory operated with the laser guide star adaptive optics system.
After subtracting the spectrum of precursor emission at the location of Sgr A*,
we find the flare has a spectral index of -2.6 +- 0.9. If we do not subtract
the precursor light, then our spectral index is consistent with earlier
observations by Ghez et al. (2005). All observations published so far suggest
that the spectral index is a function of the flare's K-band flux.",2006-05-10T11:52:37Z
"The Faulty Assumptions of the Expanding-Universe Model vs. the Simple
  and Consistent Principles of a Flat-Universe Model -- with Moving Pisa Tower
  Experiment which Tests General Relativity","Mach Principle presents the absolute universe. For example, when Einstein
stood on the ground and relaxed, his arms fell down naturally. However, if he
rotated his body then his arms were lifted up as the rotation was faster and
faster. Mach principle is that the matter of the whole universe can affect
local dynamic systems. That is, the matter of the whole universe sets up the
local absolute reference frames. However, Einstein's general theory of
relativity is against the absolute reference frames of Mach Principle.",2006-05-09T00:10:51Z
"Chandra X-Ray Observations of Nineteen Millisecond Pulsars in the
  Globular Cluster 47 Tucanae","We present spectral and long-timescale variability analyses of
\textit{Chandra} ACIS-S observations of the 19 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) with
precisely known positions in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae. The X-ray
emission of the majority of these MSPs is well described by a thermal
(blackbody or neutron star hydrogen atmosphere) spectrum with a temperature
$T_{\rm eff}\sim(1-3)\times10^6$ K, emission radius $R_{\rm eff}\sim0.1-3$ km,
and luminosity $L_{X}\sim10^{30-31}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. For several MSPs, there is
indication that a second thermal component is required, similar to what is seen
in some nearby field MSPs. The radio-eclipsing binary MSPs 47 Tuc J, O, and W
show a significant non-thermal component, with photon index $\Gamma\sim 1-1.5$,
which may originate in an shock formed due to interaction between the
relativistic pulsar wind and matter from the stellar companion. We re-examine
the X-ray--spindown luminosity relation ($L_{X}-\dot{E}$) and find that due to
the large uncertainties in both parameters the result is consistent with both
the linear $L_{X}-\dot{E}$ relation and the flatter $L_X\propto\dot{E}^{0.5}$
predicted by polar cap heating models. In terms of X-ray properties, we find no
clear systematic differences between MSPs in globular clusters and in the field
of the Galaxy.",2006-04-13T20:36:17Z
The Dynamical Evolution of Planetary Nebulae After the Fast Wind,"In this paper we explore the dynamics of ionization bounded planetary nebulae
after the termination of the fast stellar wind. When the stellar wind becomes
negligible, the hot, shocked bubble depressurizes and the thermal pressure of
the photoionized region, at the inner edge of the swept-up shell, becomes
dominant. At this stage the shell tends to fragment creating clumps with
comet-like tails and long, photoionized trails in between, while the
photoionized material expands back towards the central stars as a rarefaction
wave. Once that the photoionized gas fills the inner cavity, it develops a
kinematical pattern of increasing velocity from the center outwards with a
typical range of velociti es starting from the systemic velocity to 50 Km/s at
the edges. The Helix nebula is a clear example of a planetary nebula at this
late evolutionary stage.",2006-06-08T19:14:15Z
Deployable Payloads with Starbug,"We explore the range of wide field multi-object instrument concepts taking
advantage of the unique capabilities of the Starbug focal plane positioning
concept. Advances to familiar instrument concepts, such as fiber positioners
and deployable fiber-fed IFUs, are discussed along with image relays and
deployable active sensors. We conceive deployable payloads as components of
systems more traditionally regarded as part of telescope systems rather than
instruments - such as adaptive optics and ADCs. Also presented are some of the
opportunities offered by the truly unique capabilities of Starbug, such as
microtracking to apply intra-field distortion correction during the course of
an observation.",2006-06-14T02:13:26Z
Testing and selection cosmological models with dark energy,"It is described dynamics of a large class of accelerating cosmological models
in terms of dynamical systems of the Newtonian type. The evolution of the
models is reduced to the motion of a particle in a potential well parameterized
by the scale factor. This potential function can be reconstructed from distant
supernovae type Ia data and many cosmological models represented in terms of
the potential becomes in a good agreement with current observational data. It
is proposed to use the information criteria to overcome this degeneracy within
a class of A) dark energy models and B) simple models basing on modification of
the FRW equation. Two class of models can be recommended by the Akaike (AIC)
and Schwarz (BIC) information criteria: the phantom and $\Lambda$CDM models.",2006-03-20T19:10:46Z
Galaxy morphology and evolution from SWAN Adaptive Optics imaging,"We present the results from adaptive optics (AO) assisted imaging in the Ks
band of an area of 15 arcmin^2 for SWAN (Survey of a Wide Area with NACO). We
derive the high resolution near-IR morphology of ~400 galaxies up to Ks~23.5 in
the first 21 SWAN fields around bright guide stars, carefully taking into
account the survey selection effects and using an accurate treatment of the
anisoplanatic AO PSF. The detected galaxies are sorted into two morphological
classes according to their Sersic index. The extracted morphological properties
and number counts of the galaxies are compared with the predictions of
different galaxy formation and evolution models, both for the whole galaxy
population and separately for late-type and early-type galaxies. This is one of
the first times such a comparison has been done in the near-IR, as AO
observations and accurate PSF modeling are needed to obtain reliable
morphological classification of faint field galaxies at these wavelengths. For
early-type galaxies we find that a pure luminosity evolution model, without
evidence for relevant number and size evolution, better reproduces the observed
properties of our Ks-selected sample than current semi-analytic models based on
the hierarchical picture of galaxy formation. In particular, we find that the
observed flattening of elliptical galaxy counts at Ks~20 is quantitatively in
good agreement with the prediction of the pure luminosity evolution model that
was calculated prior to the observation. For late-type galaxies, while both
models are able to reproduce the number counts, we find some hints of a
possible size growth. These results demonstrate the unique power of AO
observations to derive high resolution details of faint galaxies' morphology in
the near-IR and drive studies of galaxy evolution.",2006-07-11T09:19:44Z
"Ultraviolet Through Far-Infrared Spatially Resolved Analysis of the
  Recent Star Formation in M81 (NGC3031)","The recent star formation (SF) in the early-type spiral galaxy M81 is
characterized using imaging observations from the far-ultraviolet (UV) to the
far-infrared (IR). We compare these data with models of the stellar, gas, and
dust emission for sub-galactic regions. Our results suggest the existence of a
diffuse dust emission not directly linked to the recent SF. We find a radial
decrease of the dust temperature and dust mass density, and in the attenuation
of the stellar light. The IR emission in M81 can be modeled with three
components: 1) cold dust with a temperature <T_c>=18+-2 K, concentrated near
the HII regions but also presenting a diffuse distribution; 2) warm dust with
T_w=53+-7 K, directly linked with the HII regions; and 3) aromatic molecules,
with diffuse morphology peaking around the HII regions. We derive several
relationships to obtain total IR luminosities from IR monochromatic fluxes, and
we compare five different star formation rate (SFR) estimators for HII regions
in M81 and M51: the UV, Halpha, and three estimators based on Spitzer data. We
find that the Halpha luminosity absorbed by dust correlates tightly with the 24
microns emission. The correlation with the total IR luminosity is not as good.
Important variations from galaxy to galaxy are found when estimating the total
SFR with the 24 microns or the total IR emission alone. The most reliable
estimations of the total SFRs are obtained by combining the Halpha emission (or
the UV) and an IR luminosity (especially the 24 microns emission), which probe
the unobscured and obscured SF, respectively. For the entire M81 galaxy, about
50% of the total SF is obscured by dust. The percentage of obscured SF ranges
from 60% in the inner regions of the galaxy to 30% in the outer zones.",2006-05-23T21:29:54Z
"Testing the Disk-Locking Paradigm: An Association Between U-V Excess and
  Rotation in NGC 2264","We present some results from a UVI photometric study of a field in the young
open cluster NGC 2264 aimed, in part, at testing whether accretion in pre-main
sequence stars is linked to rotation. We confirm that U-V excess is well
correlated with H-alpha equivalent width for the stars in our sample. We show
that for the more massive stars in the cluster sample (roughly 0.4-1.2 M_sun)
there is also a significant association between U-V excess and rotation, in the
sense that slow rotators are more likely to show excess U-band emission and
variability. This constitutes significant new evidence in support of the
disk-locking paradigm.",2006-07-10T20:13:46Z
"A Fundamental Relation Between Compact Stellar Nuclei, Supermassive
  Black Holes, and Their Host Galaxies","Imaging surveys with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have shown that roughly
50-80% of low- and intermediate-luminosity galaxies contain a compact stellar
nucleus at their center, regardless of host galaxy morphological type. We
combine HST imaging for early-type galaxies from the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey
with ground-based long-slit spectra from KPNO to show that the masses of
compact stellar nuclei in Virgo Cluster galaxies obey a tight correlation with
the masses of the host galaxies. The same correlation is obeyed by the
supermassive black holes (SBHs) found in predominantly massive galaxies. The
compact stellar nuclei in the Local Group galaxies M33 and NGC205 are also
found to fall along this same scaling relation. These results indicate that a
generic by-product of galaxy formation is the creation of a Central Massive
Object (CMO) -- either a SBH or a compact stellar nucleus -- that contains a
mean fraction, ~ 0.2%, of the total galactic mass. In galaxies with masses
greater than a few times 10^10 solar masses, SBHs appear to be the dominant
mode of CMO formation.",2006-03-30T23:04:30Z
"Angular Diameter Distance Measurement with Galaxy Clustering in the
  Multipole Space","The shape of the angular power spectrum of galaxies in the linear regime is
defined by the horizon size at the matter-radiation equality. When calibrated
by cosmic microwave background measurements, the shape of the clustering
spectrum can be used as a standard ruler to estimate angular diameter distance
as a function of redshift at which galaxy clustering is measured. We apply the
proposed cosmological test of Cooray et al. (2001) to a recent set of luminous
red galaxy angular clustering spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey between
redshifts of 0.2 and 0.6. Using the overall shape of the clustering power
spectrum in the linear regime, w e measure comoving angular diameter distances
to eight redshift bins by marginalizing over the bias factors that determine
the overall amplitude of the clustering spectrum in each of the bins. The
Hubble constant consistent with these distance estimates is 68.5^+6.7_-6.1 km
s^-1 Mpc-1 at the 68% confidence level. We comment on the expected improvements
with future surveys and the potential to measure dark energy parameters with
this method.",2006-07-06T21:54:27Z
"Oxygen abundance variations in the system of the two blue compact dwarf
  galaxies SBS 0335-052E and SBS 0335-052W","We present 3.6m ESO telescope spectroscopic observations of the system of the
two blue compact dwarf galaxies SBS 0335-052W and SBS 0335-052E. The oxygen
abundance in SBS 0335-052W is 12 + log O/H = 7.13 +/- 0.08, confirming that
this galaxy is the most metal-deficient emission-line galaxy known. We find
that the oxygen abundance in SBS 0335-052E varies from region to region in the
range from 7.20 to 7.31, suggesting the presence of an abundance gradient over
a spatial scale of 1 kpc. Signatures of early carbon-type Wolf-Rayet stars are
detected in cluster 3 of SBS 0335-052E, corresponding to the emission of three
to eighteen WC4 stars, depending on the adopted luminosity of a single WC4 star
in the CIV 4658 emission line.",2006-04-12T13:14:57Z
"Chemical abundances in LMC stellar populations I. The Inner disk sample
  Based on observations collected at the VLT UT2 telescope","The advent of the new class 8 meters telescopes allows for the first time the
detailed study of numerous stars of galaxies other than our own. The Large
Magellanic Cloud is one of the most interesting targets due to its proximity
and its relatively face-on disk, permitting to separate populations pertaining
to the different structures of the galaxy. We have used FLAMES (the Fibre Large
Array Multi Element Spectrograph) at the VLT-UT2 telescope to obtain spectra of
a large sample of stars from the Inner Disk of the LMC, $\sim$2 kpc from the
center of the galaxy. We investigate the chemical abundances of iron-peak
elements, heavy and light $s$-process elements, Cu, Na, Sc and
$\alpha$-elements for a sample of red giant stars. Metallicities for the sample
stars range from [Fe/H] = $-$1.76 to $-$0.02. LMC inner disk stars show a
definitely different chemical pattern when compared to galactic stars of the
same metallicity.",2006-04-01T20:25:10Z
Compact X-ray Binaries in and out of Core Collapsed Globulars,"We review new Chandra and HST observations of the core collapsed cluster NGC
6397 as a guide to understanding the compact binary (CB) populations in core
collapse globulars. New cataclysmic variables (CVs) and main sequence
chromospherically active binaries (ABs) have been identified, enabling a larger
sample for comparison of the Lx, Fx/Fv and X-ray vs. optical color
distributions. Comparison of the numbers of CBs with Lx >10^31 erg/s in 4 core
collapse vs. 12 King model clusters reveals that the specific frequency Sx
(number of CBs per unit cluster mass) is enhanced in core collapse clusters,
even when normalized for their stellar encounter rate. Although core collapse
is halted by the dynamical heating due to stellar (and binary) interaction with
CBs in the core, we conclude that production of the hardest CBs -- especially
CVs -- is enhanced during core collapse. NGC 6397 has its most luminous CVs
nearest the cluster center, with two newly discovered very low luminosity (old,
quiescent) CVs far from the core. The active binaries as well as neutron star
systems (MSP and qLMXB) surround the central core. The overall CB population
appears to be asymmetric about the cluster center, as in several other core
collapse clusters observed with Chandra, suggesting still poorly-understood
scattering processes.",2006-05-04T19:26:32Z
"Gemini/GMOS IFU stellar kinematics of the nuclear region of six nearby
  active galaxies","We present two-dimensional (2D) mapping of the stellar velocity field within
the inner 5 arcsec of six nearby active galaxies, using spectra obtained with
the Integral Field Unit of the GMOS instrument at the Gemini North telescope.
The spatial resolution range from 20 to about 180 pc, and the observed field of
view covers a few hundred parsecs around the nuclei. The Calcium II triplet
absorption features at ~ 8500 A were used to measure the stellar radial
velocities and velocity dispersions (sigma). A simple kinematical model
assuming a purely rotating system with circular orbits in a plane was fitted to
the radial velocity data. The turnover of the rotation curve is at only ~ 50 pc
for NGC 4051 and between 200 and 700 pc for the other 5 galaxies. The sigma
maps show the largest values at the centre. In the cases of NGC 2273 and NGC
3227, there is a decrease to sigma ~ 70-80 km/s at ~ 200-300 pc from the
nucleus, delineating partial rings of low sigma values. A similar broken ring
seems to be present at ~ 400 pc from the nucleus also in NGC 4593. We interpret
these low sigma rings as traces of recently formed stars that partially keep
the cold kinematics of the original gas from which they have formed.
  The main novelty of the present work is the unprecedented spatial resolution
reached by a 2D study of stellar kinematics of Seyfert galaxies using an IFU.
The few similar IFU studies available in the literature for Seyfert galaxies
have a much poorer spatial resolution and/or are restricted to the study of
emission line kinematics.",2006-06-27T21:40:55Z
"A search for a counterpart of the unidentified gamma-ray source 3EG
  J2020+4017 (2CG078+2)","We report observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory of a field in the
gamma$-Cygni supernova remnant (SNR78.2+2.1) centered on the cataloged location
of the unidentified, bright gamma-ray source 3EG J2020+4017. In this search for
an X-ray counterpart to the gamma-ray source, we detected 30 X-ray sources. Of
these, we found 17 strong-candidate counterparts in optical (visible through
near-infrared) cataloged and an additional 3 through our optical observations.
Based upon colors and (for several objects) optical spectra, nearly all the
optically identified objects appear to be reddened main-sequence stars. None of
the X-ray sources with an optical counterpart is a plausible X-ray counterpart
to 3EG J2020+4017 --if that gamma-ray source is a spin-powered pulsar. Many of
the 10 X-ray sources lacking optical counterparts are likely (extragalactic)
active galactic nuclei, based upon the sky density of such sources. Although
one of the 10 optically unidentified X-ray sources could be the gamma-ray
source, there is no auxiliary evidence supporting such an identification.",2006-06-23T17:41:35Z
Remarkable non-dipolar magnetic field of the Bp star HD 137509,"The southern magnetic Bp star HD 137509 exhibits complex rotational
modulation of the longitudinal field and other magnetic observables.
Interpretation of this magnetic variability in the framework of the low-order
multipolar field models suggests a very strong quadrupolar component to
dominate the surface field topology of HD 137509. I have examined the
high-quality VLT/UVES spectra of HD 137509 and discovered resolved Zeeman split
components in some of the spectral lines. The inferred mean surface field
modulus, <B>=29 kG, agrees with the multipolar model predictions. This confirms
the presence of an extremely strong non-dipolar magnetic field in HD 137509 and
establishes this star as the object with the second-largest field among
magnetic chemically peculiar stars.",2006-03-30T20:21:44Z
"Molecular Line Observations of Infrared Dark Clouds: Seeking the
  Precursors to Intermediate and Massive Star Formation","We have identified 41 infrared dark clouds from the 8 micron maps of the
Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX), selected to be found within one square degree
areas centered on known ultracompact HII regions. We have mapped these infrared
dark clouds in N2H+(1-0), CS(2-1) and C18O(1-0) emission using the Five College
Radio Astronomy Observatory. The maps of the different species often show
striking differences in morphologies, indicating differences in evolutionary
state and/or the presence of undetected, deeply embedded protostars. We derive
an average mass for these clouds using N2H+ column densities of ~2500 solar
masses, a value comparable to that found in previous studies of high mass star
forming cores using other mass tracers. The linewidths of these clouds are
typically ~2.0 - 2.9 km/s. Based on the fact that they are dark at 8 micron,
compact, massive, and have large velocity dispersions, we suggest that these
clouds may be the precursor sites of intermediate and high mass star formation.",2006-06-12T23:34:11Z
WMAP 3-year primordial power spectrum,"We constrain the form of the primordial power spectrum using Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 3-year cosmic microwave background (CMB) data
(+ other high resolution CMB experiments) in addition to complementary
large-scale structure (LSS) data: 2dF, SDSS, Ly-alpha forest and luminous red
galaxy (LRG) data from the SDSS catalogue. We compute the comparative Bayesian
evidence in addition to parameter estimates for a collection of seven models:
(i) a scale invariant Harrison-Zel'dovich (H-Z) spectrum; (ii) a power-law;
(iii) a running spectral index; (iv) a broken spectrum; (v) a power-law with an
abrupt cutoff on large-scales; (vi) a reconstruction of the spectrum in eight
bins in wavenumber; and (vii) a spectrum resulting from a cosmological model
proposed by Lasenby & Doran (L-D). Using a basic dataset of WMAP3 + other CMB +
2dF + SDSS our analysis confirms that a scale-invariant spectrum is disfavoured
by between 0.7 and 1.7 units of log evidence (depending on priors chosen) when
compared with a power-law tilt. Moreover a running spectrum is now
significantly preferred, but only when using the most constraining set of
priors. The addition of Ly-alpha and LRG data independently both suggest much
lower values of the running index than with basic dataset alone and
interestingly the inclusion of Ly-alpha significantly disfavours a running
parameterisation by more than a unit in log evidence. Overall the highest
evidences, over all datasets, were obtained with a power law spectrum
containing a cutoff with a significant log evidence difference of roughly 2
units. The natural tilt and exponential cutoff present in the L-D spectrum is
found to be favoured decisively by a log evidence difference of over 5 units,
but only for a limited study within the best-fit concordance cosmology.",2006-07-18T00:53:13Z
Quasars and Galaxy Clusters Paired Across NGC 4410,"The aim is to investigate the region of the sky around NGC4410/Mrk1325 for
objects which are physically associated with this active, double nucleus
galaxy. We use archived data to study the placement, brightness, X-ray
properties and redshifts of objects within 60' of the bright, central galaxy.
It is found that pairs of quasars are aligned across NGC 4410 which, if ejected
from it, have equal and opposite ejection velocities and fall very close to the
quantized Karlsson redshift peaks for quasars. X-ray sources and Abell galaxy
clusters at higher redshifts appear elongated along directions away from
NGC4410.",2006-05-18T13:48:55Z
Circumstellar Emission from Type Ib and Ic Supernovae,"The presumed Wolf-Rayet star progenitors of Type Ib/c supernovae have fast,
low density winds and the shock waves generated by the supernova interaction
with the wind are not expected to be radiative at typical times of observation.
The injected energy spectrum of radio emitting electrons typically has an
observed index p=3, which is suggestive of acceleration in cosmic ray dominated
shocks. The early, absorbed part of the radio light curves can be attributed to
synchrotron self-absorption, which leads to constraints on the magnetic field
in the emitting region and on the circumstellar density. The range of
circumstellar densities inferred from the radio emission is somewhat broader
than that for Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars, if similar efficiencies of synchrotron
emission are assumed in the extragalactic supernovae. For the observed and
expected ranges of circumstellar densities to roughly overlap, a high
efficiency of magnetic field production in the shocked region is required
(epsilon_B ~ 0.1). For the expected densities around a Wolf-Rayet star, a
nonthermal mechanism is generally required to explain the observed X-ray
luminosities of Type Ib/c supernovae. Although the inverse Compton mechanism
can explain the observed X-ray emission from SN 2002ap if the wind parameters
are taken from the radio model, the mechanism is not promising for other
supernovae unless the postshock magnetic energy density is much smaller than
the electron energy density. In some cases another mechanism is definitely
needed and we suggest that it is X-ray synchrotron emission in a case where the
shock wave is cosmic ray dominated so that the electron energy spectrum
flattens at high energy. More comprehensive X-ray observations of a Type Ib/c
supernova are needed to determine whether this suggestion is correct.",2006-07-10T15:33:53Z
"Instantaneous Radio Spectra of Giant Pulses from the Crab Pulsar from
  Decimeter to Decameter Wavelengths","The results of simultaneous multifrequency observations of giant radio pulses
from the Crab pulsar, PSR B0531+21, at 23, 111, and 600 MHz are presented and
analyzed. Giant pulses were detected at a frequency as low as 23 MHz for the
first time. Of the 45 giant pulses detected at 23 MHz, 12 were identified with
counterparts observed simultaneously at 600 MHz. Of the 128 giant pulses
detected at 111 MHz, 21 were identified with counterparts observed
simultaneously at 600 MHz. The spectral indices for the power-law frequency
dependence of the giant-pulse energies are from -3.1 to -1.6. The mean spectral
index is -2.7 +/- 0.1 and is the same for both frequency combinations (600-111
MHz and 600-23 MHz). The large scatter in the spectral indices of the
individual pulses and the large number of unidentified giant pulses suggest
that the spectra of the individual giant pulses do not actually follow a simple
power law. The observed shapes of the giant pulses at all three frequencies are
determined by scattering on interstellar plasma irregularities. The scatter
broadening of the pulses and its frequency dependence were determined as
tau_sc=20*(f/100)^(-3.5 +/- 0.1) ms, where the frequency f is in MHz.",2006-06-01T13:51:01Z
Failed disk winds; a physical origin for the soft X-ray excess?,"The origin of the soft X-ray excess emission observed in many type-1 AGN has
been an unresolved problem in X-ray astronomy for over two decades. We develop
the model proposed Gierlinski & Done (2004), which models the soft excess with
heavily smeared, ionized, absorption, by including the emission that must be
associated with this absorption. We show that, rather than hindering the
ionized absorption model, the addition of the emission actually helps this
model reproduce the soft excess. The emission fills in some of the absorption
trough, while preserving the sharp rise at ~1 keV, allowing the total model to
reproduce the soft excess curvature from a considerably wider range of model
parameters. We demonstrate that this model is capable of reproducing even the
strongest soft X-ray excesses by fitting it to the XMM-Newton EPIC PN spectrum
of PG1211+143, with good results. The addition of the emission reduces the
column density required to fit these data by a factor ~2 and reduces the
smearing velocity from ~0.28c to ~0.2c. Gierlinski & Done suggested a tentative
origin for the absorption in the innermost, accelerating, region of an
accretion disk wind, and we highlight the advantages of this interpretation in
comparison to accretion disk reflection models of the soft excess. Associating
this material with a wind off the accretion disk results in several separate
problems however, namely, the radial nature, and the massive implied mass-loss
rate, of the wind. We propose an origin in a 'failed wind', where the central
X-ray source is strong enough to over-ionize the wind, removing the
acceleration through line absorption before the material reaches escape
velocity, allowing the material to fall back to the disk at larger radii.",2006-06-05T16:25:27Z

"The XMM-LSS Survey: A well controlled X-ray cluster sample over the D1
  CFHTLS area","We present the XMM-LSS cluster catalogue corresponding to the CFHTLS D1 area.
The list contains 13 spectroscopically confirmed, X-ray selected galaxy
clusters over 0.8 deg2 to a redshift of unity and so constitutes the highest
density sample of clusters to date. Cluster X-ray bolometric luminosities range
from 0.03 to 5x10^{44} erg/s. In this study, we describe our catalogue
construction procedure: from the detection of X-ray cluster candidates to the
compilation of a spectroscopically confirmed cluster sample with an explicit
selection function. The procedure further provides basic X-ray products such as
cluster temperature, flux and luminosity. We detected slightly more clusters
with a (0.5-2.0 keV) X-ray fluxes of >2x10^{-14} erg/s/cm^{-2} than we expected
based on expectations from deep ROSAT surveys. We also present the
Luminosity-Temperature relation for our 9 brightest objects possessing a
reliable temperature determination. The slope is in good agreement with the
local relation, yet compatible with a luminosity enhancement for the 0.15 < z<
0.35 objects having 1 < T < 2 keV, a population that the XMM-LSS is identifying
systematically for the first time. The present study permits the compilation of
cluster samples from XMM images whose selection biases are understood. This
allows, in addition to studies of large-scale structure, the systematic
investigation of cluster scaling law evolution, especially for low mass X-ray
groups which constitute the bulk of our observed cluster population. All
cluster ancillary data (images, profiles, spectra) are made available in
electronic form via the XMM-LSS cluster database.",2006-07-10T09:30:00Z
"The effect of mass-segregation on gravitational wave sources near
  massive black holes","Gravitational waves (GWs) from the inspiral of compact remnants (CRs) into
massive black holes (MBHs) will be observable to cosmological distances. While
a CR spirals in, 2-body scattering by field stars may cause it to fall into the
MBH before reaching a short period orbit that would give an observable signal.
As a result, only CRs very near (~0.01 pc) the MBH can spiral in successfully.
In a multi-mass stellar population, the heaviest objects sink to the center,
where they are more likely to slowly spiral into the MBH without being
swallowed prematurely. We study how mass-segregation modifies the stellar
distribution and the rate of GW events. We find that the inspiral rate per
galaxy for white dwarfs is 30 per Gyr, for neutron stars 6 per Gyr, and for
stellar black holes (SBHs) 250 per Gyr. The high rate for SBHs is due to their
extremely steep density profile, n_{BH}(r)\propto r^{-2}. The GW detection rate
will be dominated by SBHs.",2006-03-13T21:02:43Z
Microlensing towards LMC: a study of the LMC halo contribution,"We carry on a new analysis of the sample of MACHO microlensing candidates
towards the LMC. Our main purpose is to determine the lens population to which
the events may belong. We give particular emphasis to the possibility of
characterizing the Milky Way dark matter halo population with respect to the
LMC one. Indeed, we show that only a fraction of the events have
characteristics that match those expected for lenses belonging to the MACHO
population of the Milky Way halo. This suggests that this component cannot
explain all the candidates. Accordingly, we challenge the view that the dark
matter halo fraction of both the Milky Way and the LMC halos are equal, and
indeed we show that, for a MACHO mass in the range 0.1-0.3 M$_\odot$, the LMC
halo fraction can be significantly larger than the Milky Way one. In this
perspective, our main conclusion is that up to about half of the observed
events could be attributed to the LMC MACHO dark matter halo.",2006-07-16T08:22:11Z
Quintom models with an equation of state crossing -1,"In this paper, we investigate a kind of special quintom model, which is made
of a quintessence field $\phi_1$ and a phantom field $\phi_2$, and the
potential function has the form of $V(\phi_1^2-\phi_2^2)$. This kind of quintom
fields can be separated into two kinds: the hessence model, which has the state
of $\phi_1^2>\phi_2^2$, and the hantom model with the state
$\phi_1^2<\phi_2^2$. We discuss the evolution of these models in the
$\omega$-$\omega'$plane ($\omega$ is the state equation of the dark energy, and
$\omega'$ is its time derivative in unites of Hubble time), and find that
according to $\omega>-1$ or $<-1$, and the potential of the quintom being
climbed up or rolled down, the $\omega$-$\omega'$ plane can be divided into
four parts. The late time attractor solution, if existing, is always
quintessence-like or $\Lambda$-like for hessence field, so the Big Rip doesn't
exist. But for hantom field, its late time attractor solution can be
phantom-like or $\Lambda$-like, and sometimes, the Big Rip is unavoidable. Then
we consider two special cases: one is the hessence field with an exponential
potential, and the other is with a power law potential. We investigate their
evolution in the $\omega$-$\omega'$ plane. We also develop a theoretical method
of constructing the hessence potential function directly from the effective
equation of state function $\omega(z)$. We apply our method to five kinds of
parametrizations of equation of state parameter, where $\omega$ crossing -1 can
exist, and find they all can be realized. At last, we discuss the evolution of
the perturbations of the quintom field, and find the perturbations of the
quintom $\delta_Q$ and the metric $\Phi$ are all finite even if at the state of
$\omega=-1$ and $\omega'\neq0$.",2006-04-21T06:34:30Z
"Curvature and isocurvature perturbations from two-field inflation in a
  slow-roll expansion","We calculate the power spectra of primordial curvature and isocurvature
perturbations from a general two field inflation model at next-to-leading order
correction in a slow-roll expansion. In particular we calculate the spectral
indices to second order in slow-roll parameters. We show that the
cross-correlation of the curvature and isocurvature perturbations at the time
of Hubble-exit during inflation is non-zero at first-order in slow-roll
parameters. We apply our results to different classes of inflation, including
inflaton and curvaton scenarios. The spectrum of primordial gravitational
waves, curvature and isocurvature perturbations obey generalised consistency
relations in two-field inflation models. We give the first two consistency
relations in an infinite hierarchy.",2006-05-26T20:25:33Z
"On a systematic bias in SBF-based distances due to gravitational
  microlensing","The effect of gravitational microlensing on the determination of
extragalactic distances using surface brightness fluctuations (SBF) technique
is considered and a method to calculate SBF amplitudes in presence of
microlensing is presented. With a simple approximation for the magnification
power spectrum at low optical depth the correction to the SBF-based luminosity
distance is calculated. The results suggest the effect can be safely neglected
at present but may become important for SBF-based Hubble diagrams at luminosity
distances of about 1 Gpc and beyond.",2006-06-29T14:26:50Z
"The Serret-Andoyer Formalism in Rigid-Body Dynamics: I. Symmetries and
  Perturbations","This paper reviews the Serret-Andoyer (SA) canonical formalism in rigid-body
dynamics and presents some new results. As is well known, the problem of
unsupported and unperturbed rigid rotator can be reduced. The availability of
this reduction is offered by the underlying symmetry, which stems from
conservation of the angular momentum and rotational kinetic energy. When a
perturbation is turned on, these quantities are no longer preserved.
Nonetheless, the language of reduced description remains extremely instrumental
even in the perturbed case. We describe the canonical reduction performed by
the Serret-Andoyer (SA) method, and discuss its applications to attitude
dynamics and to the theory of planetary rotation. Specifically, we consider the
case of angular-velocity-dependent torques, and discuss the
variation-of-parameters-inherent antinomy between canonicity and osculation.
Finally, we address the transformation of the Andoyer variables into the
action-angle ones, using the method of Sadov.",2006-07-10T17:16:16Z
"Spitzer/IRAC and ISOCAM/CVF insights on the origin of the Near to Mid-IR
  Galactic diffuse emission","We measure IRAC colors of extended emission in several fields covering a
range of Galactic latitudes and longitudes outside of star forming regions. We
determine the nature of the Galactic diffuse emission in Spitzer/IRAC images by
combining them with spectroscopic data. We show that PAH features make the
emission in the IRAC 5.8 and 8.0 $\mu$m channels, whereas the 3.3 $\mu$m
feature represents only 20 to 50% of the IRAC 3.6 $\mu$m channel. A NIR
continuum is necessary to account for IRAC 4.5 $\mu$m emission and the
remaining fraction of the IRAC 3.6 $\mu$m emission. This continuum cannot be
accounted by scattered light. It represents 9% of the total power absorbed by
PAHs and 120% of the interstellar UV photon flux. The 3.3 $\mu$m feature is
observed to vary from field-to-field with respect to the IRAC 8.0 $\mu$m
channel. The continuum and 3.3 $\mu$m feature intensities are not correlated.
We present model calculations which relate our measurements of the PAHs
spectral energy distribution to the particles size and ionization state. Cation
and neutral PAHs emission properties are inferred empirically from
\object{NGC7023} observations. PAHs caracteristics are best constrained in a
line of sight towards the inner Galaxy, dominated by the Cold Neutral Medium
phase : we find that the PAH cation fraction is about 50% and that their mean
size is about 60 carbon atoms. A significant field-to-field dispersion in the
PAH mean size, from 40 to 80 carbon atoms, is necessary to account for the
observed variations in the 3.3 $\mu$m feature intensity relative to the IRAC
8.0 $\mu$m flux. However, one cannot be secure about the feature interpretation
as long as the continuum origin remains unclear.",2006-04-11T12:58:37Z
Statistics of Giant Radio Halos from Electron Reacceleration Models,"The most important evidence of non-thermal phenomena in galaxy clusters comes
from Giant Radio Halos (GRHs), synchrotron radio sources extended over Mpc
scales, detected in a growing number of massive galaxy clusters. A promising
possibility to explain these sources is given by ""in situ"" stochastic
reacceleration of relativistic electrons by turbulence generated in the cluster
volume during merger events. Cassano & Brunetti (2005) have recently shown that
the expected fraction of clusters with GRHs and the increase of such a fraction
with cluster mass can be reconciled with present observations provided that a
fraction of 20-30 % of the turbulence in clusters is in the form of
compressible modes. In this work we extend these calculations by including a
scaling of the magnetic field strength with cluster mass. We show that the
observed correlations between the synchrotron radio power of a sample of 17
GRHs and the X-ray properties of the hosting clusters are consistent with, and
actually predicted by a magnetic field dependence on the virial mass of the
form B \propto M^b, with b>0.5 and typical micro Gauss strengths of the average
B intensity. The occurrence of GRHs as a function of both cluster mass and
redshift is obtained. The most relevant findings are that the predicted
luminosity functions of GRHs are peaked around a power P_{1.4 GHz} 10^{24}
W/Hz, and severely cut-off at low radio powers due to the decrease of the
electron reacceleration in smaller galaxy clusters. We expect a total number of
GRHs to be discovered at ~mJy radio fluxes of ~100 at 1.4 GHz. Finally, the
occurrence of GRHs and their number counts at 150 MHz are estimated in view of
the fortcoming operation of low frequency observatories (LOFAR, LWA) and
compared with those at higher radio frequencies.",2006-04-05T16:45:08Z
"ELSA: An Integrated, Semi-Automated Nebular Abundance Package","We present ELSA, a new modular software package, written in C, to analyze and
manage spectroscopic data from emission-line objects. In addition to
calculating plasma diagnostics and abundances from nebular emission lines, the
software provides a number of convenient features including the ability to
ingest logs produced by IRAF's splot task, to semi-automatically merge spectra
in different wavelength ranges, and to automatically generate various data
tables in machine-readable or LaTeX format. ELSA features a highly
sophisticated interstellar reddening correction scheme that takes into account
temperature and density effects as well as He II contamination of the hydrogen
Balmer lines. Abundance calculations are performed using a 5-level atom
approximation with recent atomic data, based on R. Henry's ABUN program.
Improvements planned in the near future include use of a three-region
ionization model, similar to IRAF's nebular package, error propagation, and the
addition of ultraviolet and infrared line analysis capability. Detailed
documentation for all aspects of ELSA are available at

"Diagnostics of active galaxies: I. Modeling the infrared properties of
  dusty cores of starburst galaxies","An evolutionary model of star formation in ULIRGs was created using existing
star formation and radiative transfer codes (STARBURST99, RADMC and RADICAL) as
building blocks. The results of the simulations are compared to data from two
IRAS catalogs. From the simulations it is found that the dust surrounding the
starburst region is made up from two components. There is a low optical depth
(tau=0.1, which corresponds to 0.1% of the total dust mass), hot (T~400K)
non-grey component close to the starburst (scale size 10pc) and a large scale,
colder grey component (100pc, 75K) with a much larger column (tau=10). The
simulations also show that starburst galaxies can be powered by massive star
formation. The parameters for this star forming region are difficult to
determine, since the IR continuum luminosity is only sensitive to the total UV
input. Therefore, there is a degeneracy between the total starburst mass and
the initial mass function (IMF) slope. A less massive star formation with a
shallower IMF will produce the same amount of OB stars and therefore the same
amount of irradiating UV flux. Assuming the stars are formed according to a
Salpeter IMF (Psi(M) ~ M^-2.35), the star formation region should produce 10^9
Msun of stars (either in one instantaneous burst, or in a continuous process)
in order to produce enough IR radiation.",2006-07-27T14:38:00Z
Entropy perturbations and large-scale magnetic fields,"An appropriate gauge-invariant framework for the treatment of magnetized
curvature and entropy modes is developed. It is shown that large-scale magnetic
fields, present after neutrino decoupling, affect curvature and entropy
perturbations. The evolution of different magnetized modes is then studied
across the matter-radiation transition both analytically and numerically. From
the observation that, after equality (but before decoupling) the (scalar)
Sachs-Wolfe contribution must be (predominantly) adiabatic, constraints on the
magnetic power spectra are deduced. The present results motivate the
experimental analysis of more general initial conditions of CMB anisotropies
(i.e. mixtures of magnetized adiabatic and isocurvature modes during the
pre-decoupling phase). The role of the possible correlations between the
different components of the fluctuations is partially discussed.",2006-04-06T14:13:24Z
Intracluster Planetary Nebulae,"I review the progress in research on intracluster planetary nebulae over the
last five years. Hundreds more intracluster planetary nebulae have been
detected in the nearby Virgo and Fornax galaxy clusters, searches of several
galaxy groups have been made, and intracluster planetary candidates have been
detected in the distant Coma cluster. The first theoretical studies of
intracluster planetaries have also been completed, studying their utility as
tracers of the intracluster light as a whole, and also as individual objects.
  From the results to date, it appears that intracluster planetaries are common
in galaxy clusters (10-20% of the total amount of starlight), but thus far,
none have been detected in galaxy groups, a result which currently is not well
understood. Limited spectroscopic follow-up of intracluster planetaries in
Virgo indicate that they have a complex velocity structure, in agreement with
numerical models of intracluster light. Hydrodynamic simulations of individual
intracluster planetaries predict that their morphology is significantly altered
by their intracluster environment, but their emission-line properties appear to
be unaffected.",2006-06-07T20:24:12Z
"IRAC and MIPS Observations of the Interacting Galaxies IC 2163 and NGC
  2207: Clumpy Emission","IC 2163 and NGC 2207 are interacting galaxies that have been well studied at
optical and radio wavelengths and simulated in numerical models to reproduce
the observed kinematics and morphological features. Spitzer IRAC and MIPS
observations reported here show over 200 bright clumps from young star
complexes. The brightest IR clump is a morphologically peculiar region of star
formation in the western arm of NGC 2207. This clump, which dominates the
Halpha and radio continuum emission from both galaxies, accounts for ~12% of
the total 24mu m flux. Nearly half of the clumps are regularly spaced along
some filamentary structure, whether in the starburst oval of IC 2163 or in the
thin spiral arms of NGC 2207. This regularity appears to influence the clump
luminosity function, making it peaked at a value nearly a factor of 10 above
the completeness limit, particularly in the starburst oval. This is unlike the
optical clusters inside the clumps, which have a luminosity function consistent
with the usual power law form. The giant IR clumps presumably formed by
gravitational instabilities in the compressed gas of the oval and the spiral
arms, whereas the individual clusters formed by more chaotic processes, such as
turbulence compression, inside these larger-scale structures.",2006-05-20T02:10:13Z
"Tagging single muons and other long-flying relativistic charged
  particles by ultra-fast timing in air Cherenkov telescopes","Atmospheric air Cherenkov telescopes are successfully used for ground-based,
very high-energy (VHE) gamma ray astronomy. Triggers from the so-called single
muon and other long-flying relativistic charged particle events are an unwanted
background for the Cherenkov telescope. Because of low rate at TeV energies the
muon background is unimportant. It is much more intense for telescopes with
high photon sensitivity and low energy threshold. Below a few hundred GeV
energy, the so-called muon background becomes so intense, that it can
deteriorate the sensitivity of telescopes (the so-called muon-wall problem).
  From general considerations it can be anticipated that the signature of these
particles should be a light pulse with a narrow time structure. In fact,
simulations show that the pulses from muons have a very narrow time profile
that is well below the time resolutions of nearly all currently operating
telescopes. In this report we elaborate on the time profile of Cherenkov light
from the so-called single muons and show that a telescope with ultra-fast time
response can open a new dimension allowing one to tag and to reject those
events.",2006-05-03T13:57:16Z
The CMB polarization: status and prospects,"The study of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization is still in a
pioneering stage, but promises to bring a huge advancement in cosmology in the
near future, just as high-accuracy observations of the anisotropies in the
total intensity of the CMB revolutionized our understanding of the universe in
the past few years. In this contribution, we outline the scientific case for
observing CMB polarization, and review the current observational status and
future experimental prospects in the field.",2006-06-21T09:08:16Z
Mid-Infrared Emission from Dust around Quiescent Low-Mass X-ray Binaries,"We report the discovery of excess 4.5 and 8 micron emission from three
quiescent black hole low-mass X-ray binaries, A 0620-00, GS 2023+338, and XTE
J1118+480. The mid-infrared emission from GS 2023+338 probably originates in
the accretion disk. However, the excess emission from A 0620-00 and XTE
J1118+480 is brighter and peaks at longer wavelengths, and so probably
originates from circumbinary dust that is heated by the light of the secondary
star. We find that the inner edge of the dust distribution lies near 1.7 times
the binary separation, which is the minimum radius at which a circumbinary disk
would be stable against tidal disruption. The excess infrared emission is not
detected at 24 micron, which implies that the dust does not extend beyond about
3 times the binary separation. The total masses of circumbinary material are
between 10^22 and 10^24 g. The material could be the remains of fall-back disks
produced in supernovae, or material from the companions injected into
circumbinary orbits during mass transfer.",2006-07-05T18:46:36Z
Observational Constraints on the Acceleration Discrepancy Problem,"I review the data relating to the appearance of the missing mass problem at a

"Towards event-by-event studies of the ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray
  composition","We suggest a method which improves the precision of studies of the primary
composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Two principal ingredients of the
method are (1) comparison of the observed and simulated parameters for
individual showers, without averaging over arrival directions and (2)
event-by-event selection of simulated showers by the physical observables and
not by the reconstructed primary parameters. A detailed description of the
algorithm is presented and illustrated by several examples.",2006-06-19T11:32:32Z
Halos and voids in a multifractal model of cosmic structure,"On the one hand, the large scale structure of matter is arguably scale
invariant, and, on the other hand, halos and voids are recognized as prominent
features of that structure. To unify both approaches, we propose to model the
dark matter distribution as a set of fractal distributions of halos of
different kinds. This model relies on the concept of multifractal as the most
general scaling distribution and on a plausible notion of halo as a singular
mass concentration in a multifractal. Voids arise as complementary to halos,
namely, as formed by regular mass depletions. To provide halos with definite
size and masses, we coarse-grain the dark matter distribution, using the length
given by the lower cutoff to scaling. This allows us to relate the halo mass
function to the multifractal spectrum. Hence, we find that a log-normal model
of the mass distribution nicely fits in this picture and, moreover, the
Press-Schechter mass function can be recovered as a bifractal limit.
  To support our model of fractal distributions of halos, we perform a
numerical study of the distribution produced in cosmological N-body
simulations. In the Virgo L-CDM GIF2 simulation, we indeed find fractal
distributions of halos with various dimensions and a halo mass function of
bifractal type. However, this mass function is not of Press-Schechter's type,
and we interprete it instead as caused by the undersampling of the distribution
at the scale of halos, due to discretization.",2006-04-10T17:15:13Z
Stellar populations in the nuclei of late-type spiral galaxies,"(Abridged) As part of an ongoing effort to study the stellar nuclei of very
late-type, bulge-less spirals, we present results from a high-resolution
spectroscopic survey of nine such nuclear star clusters, undertaken with
VLT/UVES. We fit the spectra with population synthesis models and measure
Lick-type indices to determine mean luminosity-weighted ages, which range from
4.1*10^7 to 1.1*10^10 years and are insensitive to assumed metallicity or
internal extinction. The average metallicity of nuclear clusters in late-type
spirals is slightly sub-solar (<Z> = 0.015) but shows significant scatter. The
fits also show that the nuclear cluster spectra are best described by a mix of
several generations of stars. This is supported by the fact that only models
with composite stellar populations yield mass-to-light ratios that match those
obtained from dynamical measurements. The last star formation episode was on
average 34 Myr ago, while all clusters experienced some star formation in the
last 100 Myr. We thus conclude that the nuclear clusters undergo repeated
episodes of star formation. The robustness with respect to possible
contamination from the underlying galaxy disk is demonstrated by comparison to
spectra obtained with HST/STIS. Combining these results with those from Walcher
et al. (2005), we have thus shown that the stellar nuclei of these bulge-less
galaxies are massive and dense star clusters that form stars recurrently until
the present day. This unique set of properties is likely due to the central
location of these clusters in their host galaxies.",2006-04-06T16:30:28Z
"Radiation from an expanding cocoon as an explanation of the steep decay
  observed in GRB early afterglow light curves","Observations of early afterglow emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRB's) with
the Swift satellite show steep decay of the X-ray light curve, F_\nu(t) ~
t^{-\alpha} with \alpha ~ 2.5 - 4 at ~300-500 s after the burst trigger. The
spectrum in this time interval is consistent with a spectrum F_\nu ~
\nu^{-\beta} with \beta ~1. Here, we show that these results can be explained
as due to emission from the hot plasma ""cocoon"" associated with the jet, which
expands relativistically after the jet has broken through the stellar envelope,
if a substantial fraction of the coccon kinetic energy is dissipated at
scattering optical depths \tau_T ~ 10^2-10^3. This results in the bulk of the
coccon photons being observed at X-ray energies, after a delay of few hundreds
of seconds relative to the gamma-ray photons from the jet. Multiple Compton
scattering inside the cocoon causes a spread in the arrival times of the X-ray
photons. We calculate numerically the observed light curve of photons emerging
from the cocoon, and show that it exhibits a steep decay, which resembles that
observed in many GRB afterglows. During the adiabatic expansion that follows
the dissipation phase, photons lose energy to the expanding plasma, and as a
result, the emerging photon energy distribution differs from a black-body
spectrum, and can be approximated as a power law in the Swift XRT band.
Comparison of the numerical results with the Swift XRT data of GRB050315 and
GRB050421 shows good agreement between the light curves and spectra during the
initial steep decay phase.",2006-03-14T11:01:10Z

Non-gaussianity for a Two Component Hybrid Model of Inflation,"We consider a two component hybrid inflation model, in which two fields drive
inflation. Our results show that this model generates an observable
non-gaussian contribution to the curvature spectrum, within the limits allowed
by the recent WMAP year 3 data. We show that if one field has a mass less than
zero, and an initial field value less than 0.06Mpl while the other field has a
mass greater than zero, and initial field value ranging between 0.5Mpl and Mpl
then the non-gaussianity is observable with 1<fnl<1.5, but that fnl becomes
much less than the observable limit should we take both masses to have the same
sign, or if we loosened the constraints on the initial field values.",2006-04-28T14:41:04Z
Cosmology and the Bispectrum,"The present spatial distribution of galaxies in the Universe is non-Gaussian,
with 40% skewness in 50 Mpc/h spheres, and remarkably little is known about the
information encoded in it about cosmological parameters beyond the power
spectrum. In this work we present an attempt to bridge this gap by studying the
bispectrum, paying particular attention to a joint analysis with the power
spectrum and their combination with CMB data. We address the covariance
properties of the power spectrum and bispectrum including the effects of beat
coupling that lead to interesting cross-correlations, and discuss how baryon
acoustic oscillations break degeneracies. We show that the bispectrum has
significant information on cosmological parameters well beyond its power in
constraining galaxy bias, and when combined with the power spectrum is more
complementary than combining power spectra of different samples of galaxies,
since non-Gaussianity provides a somewhat different direction in parameter
space. In the framework of flat cosmological models we show that most of the
improvement of adding bispectrum information corresponds to parameters related
to the amplitude and effective spectral index of perturbations, which can be
improved by almost a factor of two. Moreover, we demonstrate that the expected
statistical uncertainties in sigma8 of a few percent are robust to relaxing the
dark energy beyond a cosmological constant.",2006-04-24T21:26:37Z

"The X-ray Properties of Active Galactic Nuclei with Double-Peaked Balmer
  Lines","Double-peaked Balmer-line profiles originate in the accretion disks of a few
percent of optically selected AGN. The reasons behind the strong low-ionization
line emission from the accretion disks of these objects is still uncertain. In
this paper, we characterize the X-ray properties of 39 double-peaked Balmer
line AGN, 29 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 10 low optical-luminosity
double-peaked emitters from earlier radio-selected samples. We find that the
UV-to-X-ray slope of radio-quiet (RQ) double-peaked emitters as a class does
not differ substantially from that of normal RQ AGN with similar UV
monochromatic luminosity. The radio-loud (RL) double-peaked emitters, with the
exception of LINER galaxies, are more luminous in the X-rays than RQ AGN, as
has been observed for other RL AGN with single-peaked profiles. The X-ray
spectral shapes of double-peaked emitters, measured by their hardness ratios or
power-law photon indices, are also largely consistent with those of normal AGN
of similar radio-loudness. In practically all cases studied here, external
illumination of the accretion disk is necessary to produce the Balmer-line
emission, as the gravitational energy released locally in the disk by viscous
stresses is insufficient to produce lines of the observed strength. In the
Appendix we study the variability of Mrk 926, a double-peaked emitter with
several observations in the optical and X-ray bands.",2006-07-11T12:54:44Z
A Curious New Milky Way Satellite in Ursa Major,"In this Letter, we study a localized stellar overdensity in the constellation
of Ursa Major, first identified in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data and
subsequently followed up with Subaru imaging. Its color-magnitude diagram (CMD)
shows a well-defined sub-giant branch, main sequence and turn-off, from which
we estimate a distance of ~30 kpc and a projected size of ~250 x 125 pc. The
CMD suggests a composite population with some range in metallicity and/or age.
Based on its extent and stellar population, we argue that this is a previously
unknown satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, hereby named Ursa Major II (UMa II)
after its constellation. Using SDSS data, we find an absolute magnitude of M_V
\~ -3.8, which would make it the faintest known satellite galaxy. UMa II's
isophotes are irregular and distorted with evidence for multiple
concentrations; this suggests that the satellite is in the process of
disruption.",2006-06-26T19:34:56Z
The Stellar Imager (SI) Vision Mission,"The Stellar Imager (SI) is a UV-Optical, Space-Based Interferometer designed
to enable 0.1 milli-arcsecond (mas) spectral imaging of stellar surfaces and of

System Connection (SSSC) Roadmap and as a candidate for a ""Pathways to Life
Observatory"" in the Exploration of the Universe Division (EUD) Roadmap (May,
2005). SI will revolutionize our view of many dynamic astrophysical processes:
its resolution will transform point sources into extended sources, and
snapshots into evolving views. SI's science focuses on the role of magnetism in
the Universe, particularly on magnetic activity on the surfaces of stars like
the Sun. SI's prime goal is to enable long-term forecasting of solar activity

"Spitzer observations of HH54 and HH7-11: mapping the H2 ortho-to-para
  ratio in shocked molecular gas","We report the results of spectroscopic mapping observations carried out
toward the Herbig-Haro objects HH7-11 and HH54 over the 5.2 - 37 micron region
using the Infrared Spectrograph of the Spitzer Space Telescope. These
observations have led to the detection and mapping of the S(0) - S(7) pure
rotational lines of molecular hydrogen, together with emissions in fine
structure transitions of Ne+, Si+, S, and Fe+. The H2 rotational emissions
indicate the presence of warm gas with a mixture of temperatures in the range
400 - 1200 K, consistent with the expected temperature behind nondissociative
shocks of velocity ~ 10 - 20 km/s, while the fine structure emissions originate
in faster shocks of velocity 35 - 90 km/s that are dissociative and ionizing.
Maps of the H2 line ratios reveal little spatial variation in the typical
admixture of gas temperatures in the mapped regions, but show that the H2
ortho-to-para ratio is quite variable, typically falling substantially below
the equilibrium value of 3 attained at the measured gas temperatures. The
non-equilibrium ortho-to-para ratios are characteristic of temperatures as low
as ~ 50 K, and are a remnant of an earlier epoch, before the gas temperature
was elevated by the passage of a shock. Correlations between the gas
temperature and H2 ortho-to-para ratio show that ortho-to-para ratios < 0.8 are
attained only at gas temperatures below ~ 900 K; this behavior is consistent
with theoretical models in which the conversion of para- to ortho-H2 behind the
shock is driven by reactive collisions with atomic hydrogen, a process which
possesses a substantial activation energy barrier (E_A/k ~ 4000 K) and is
therefore very inefficient at low temperature.",2006-06-09T14:07:54Z
Point-Source Power in 3 Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe Data,"Using a set of multifrequency cross spectra computed from the 3 year WMAP sky
maps, we fit for the unresolved point-source contribution. For a white-noise
power spectrum, we find a Q-band amplitude of A=0.011 +/- 0.001 muK^2 sr
(antenna temperature), significantly smaller than the value of 0.017 +/- 0.002
muK^2 sr used to correct the spectra in the WMAP release. Modifying the
point-source correction in this way largely resolves the discrepancy that
Eriksen et al. found between the WMAP V- and W-band power spectra. Correcting
the co-added WMAP spectrum for both the low-l power excess due to a suboptimal
likelihood approximation--also reported by Eriksen et al.--and the high-l power
deficit due to oversubtracted point sources--presented in this Letter--we find
that the net effect in terms of cosmological parameters is an \~0.7 sigma shift
in n_s to larger values. For the combination of WMAP, BOOMERANG, and ACBAR
data, we find n_s=0.969 +/- 0.016, lowering the significance of n_s not equal
to 1 from ~2.7 sigma to ~2.0 sigma.",2006-06-21T21:05:13Z
McScatter: a Simple Three-Body Scattering Package with Stellar Evolution,"We describe a simple computer package which illustrates a method of combining
stellar dynamics with stellar evolution. Though the method is intended for
elaborate applications (especially the dynamical evolution of rich star
clusters) it is illustrated here in the context of three-body scattering, i.e.
interactions between a binary star and a field of single stars. We describe the
interface between the dynamics and the two independent packages which describe
the internal evolution of single stars and binaries. We also give an example
application, and introduce a stand alone utility for the visual presentation of
simulation results.",2006-04-13T10:01:27Z
"Modelling galaxy spectra in presence of interstellar dust. II. From the
  UV to the far infrared","In this paper, we present spectrophotometric models for galaxies of different
morphological type whose spectral energy distributions (SEDs) take into account
the effect of dust in absorbing UV-optical light and re-emitting it in the
infrared (IR). The models contain three main components: (i) the diffuse
interstellar medium (ISM) composed of gas and dust, (ii) the large complexes of
molecular clouds (MCs) in which new stars are formed and (iii) the stars of any
age and chemical composition. The galaxy models stand on a robust model of
chemical evolution taylored in such a way to match the gross properties of
galaxies of different morphological type. A simple geometrical model is adopted
for each type of galaxy. The total gas and star mass provided by the chemical
model are distributed over the whole volume by means of suitable density
profiles, one for each component and depending on the galaxy type (spheroidal,
disk and disk plus bulge). The galaxy is then split in suitable volume elements
to each of which the appropriate amounts of stars, MCs and ISM are assigned. We
derive the SEDs of galaxies of different morphological type. First the the
basic relations driving the interaction between the physical components of the
galaxy are presented. Second, the main parameters are examined and their
effects on the SED of three prototype galaxies (a disk, an elliptical and a
starburster) are highlighted. The final part of the paper is devoted to assess
the ability of our galaxy models in reproducing the SEDs of a few real galaxies
of the Local Universe.",2006-05-22T15:16:11Z
Ultra-compact (X-ray) binaries,"A short review of ultra-compact binaries, focused on ultra-compact X-ray
binaries, is followed by a discussion of recent results of our VLT campaign to
obtain optical spectra of (candidate) ultra-compact X-ray binaries. We find
evidence for carbon/oxygen as well as helium/nitrogen discs and no evidence for
(traces) of hydrogen. This suggests that the donors in the observed systems are
white dwarfs. However, we also find large differences between the two C/O discs
of which we have good spectra, which highlights the need for a better
understanding of the optical spectra.",2006-05-30T15:30:38Z
Near-Field Cosmology with Horizontal Branch and RR Lyrae Stars,"The importance of horizontal branch and RR Lyrae stars is discussed in the
context of cosmological arguments for the formation of the Galactic halo and
its satellite dwarf galaxies. It is shown, in particular, that the Galactic
halo globular cluster system cannot have formed from the accretion of
``protogalactic fragments'' resembling the very early counterparts of the
present-day dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, or else its RR Lyrae
properties would be very different from what is currently observed.",2006-04-03T19:15:57Z
"Discovery of the new slowly pulsating B star HD 163830 (B5II/III) from
  MOST spacebased photometry","We report the discovery of a new slowly pulsating B (SPB) star, with the
largest number of detected frequencies to date by more than a factor of three,
based on 37 days of MOST (Microvariability & Oscillations of STars) satellite
guide star photometry. The star HD 163830 (V = 9.3, B5II/III) varies in twenty
detected frequencies in the range $0.035 - 1.06$ d$^{-1}$ ($0.4 - 12.3 ~
\mu$Hz) with amplitudes from 0.7 to 7.6 mmag ($S/N$ from {4 to 43}). Eighteen
of these frequencies are consistent with low-degree, high-order nonradial
g-modes {of seismic models of an evolved 4.5$M_{\odot}$ star. We are unable to
identify one unique model due to lack of mode identifications. The lowest two
frequencies may be associated with the rotation of HD 163830, but firm proof of
this must await future spectroscopic data.",2006-04-03T19:54:32Z
"CB17: Inferring the dynamical history of a prestellar core with
  chemo-dynamical models","We present a detailed theoretical study of the isolated Bok globule CB17
(L1389) based on spectral maps of CS, HCO$^+$, C$^{18}$O, C$^{34}$S, and
H$^{13}$CO$^+$ lines. A phenomenological model of prestellar core evolution, a
time-dependent chemical model, and a radiative transfer simulation for
molecular lines are combined to reconstruct the chemical and kinematical
structure of this core. We developed a general criterion that allows to
quantify the difference between observed and simulated spectral maps. By
minimizing this difference, we find that very high and very low values of the
effective sticking probability $S$ are not appropriate for the studied
prestellar core. The most probable $S$ value for CB17 is 0.3--0.5. The spatial
distribution of the intensities and self-absorption features of optically thick
lines is indicative of UV irradiation of the core. By fitting simultaneously
optically thin and optically thick transitions, we isolate the model that
reproduces all the available spectral maps to a reasonable accuracy. The line
asymmetry pattern in CB17 is reproduced by a combination of infall, rotation,
and turbulent motions with velocities $\sim0.05$ km s$^{-1}$, $\sim0.1$ km
s$^{-1}$, and $\sim0.1$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. These parameters corresponds
to energy ratios $E_{\rm rot}/E_{\rm grav}\approx0.03$, $E_{\rm therm}/E_{\rm
grav}\approx0.8$, and $E_{\rm turb}/E_{\rm grav}\approx0.05$ (the rotation
parameters are determined for $i=90^\circ$). The chemical age of the core is
about 2 Myrs. In particular, this is indicated by the central depletion of CO,
CS, and HCO$^+$. Based on the angular momentum value, we argue that the core is
going to fragment, i.e., to form a binary (multiple) star. (abridged)",2006-03-22T07:45:07Z
"Adaptive Optics Spectroscopy of the [Fe II] Outflows from HL Tauri and
  RW Aurigae","We present new results of [Fe II] 1.644-micron spectroscopy toward the jets
from HL Tau and RW Aur carried out with the Subaru Telescope combined with the
adaptive optics system. We observed the regions within 2"" - 3"" from the stars
with the sub-arcsecond resolutions of 0.""5 and 0.""2 for HL Tau and RW Aur,
respectively. In addition to the strong, high velocity emission extended along
each jet, we detected a blueshifted low velocity emission feature seen as a
wing or shoulder of the high velocity emission at each stellar position.
Detailed analysis shows that the position-velocity diagrams (PVDs) of HL Tau
and RW Aur show a characteristic similar to those of the cold disk wind and
X-wind models in that the [Fe II] line width is broad in the vicinity of the
stellar position and is narrower at the extended jet. A closer comparison
suggests, however, that the disk wind model tends to have too large line width
at the jet while the X-wind model has excess emission on the redshifted side at
the stellar position. The narrow velocity width with symmetric line profiles of
the observed high velocity emission supports an X-wind type model where the
launching region is localized in a small radial range, while the low velocity
emission located away from the star favors the presence of a disk wind. The [Fe
II] emission from the HL Tau jet shows a gap of 0.""8 between the redshifted jet
and the star, indicating the presence of an optically thick disk of ~ 160 AU in
radius. The [Fe II] emission from the RW Aur jet shows a marked drop from the
redshifted peak at Y ~ -0.""2 toward the star, suggesting that its disk radius
is smaller than 40 AU.",2006-06-24T00:34:44Z
Cosmic Rays: Recent Progress and some Current Questions,"Recent progress suggests we are moving towards a quantitative understanding
of the whole cosmic ray spectrum, and that many bumps due to different
components and processes hide beneath a relatively smooth total flux between
knee and ankle. The knee is much better understood: the KASCADE observations
support a rather sharp rigidity cut-off; while theoretical developments (strong
magnetic field generation) indicate that supernova remnants (SNR) of different
types should indeed accelerate to a very similar rigidity. X-ray and TeV
observations of shell-type SNR produce evidence in favour of acceleration at
their outer boundaries. There is some still-disputed evidence that the
transition to extragalactic cosmic rays has already occurred just above 10**17
eV, unmarked by an ""ankle"", in which case the whole spectrum can be well
described by adding a single power-law source spectrum from many extragalactic
sources (but modified by energy losses) to the SNR pre-knee component, if the
sources photodisintegrate all nuclei. At the highest energy, the experiments
using fluorscence light to calibrate energy do not yet show any conflict with
an expected GZK ""termination"". GRBs seem not to make a significant
contribution.",2006-07-06T13:17:07Z
Enrichment in the Centaurus cluster of galaxies,"We perform a detailed spatially-resolved, spectroscopic, analysis of the core
of the Centaurus cluster of galaxies using a deep Chandra X-ray observation and
XMM-Newton data. The Centaurus cluster core has particularly high metallicity,
upto twice Solar values, and we measure the abundances of Fe, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S,
Ar, Ca and Ni. We map the distribution of these elements in many spatial
regions,and create radial profiles to the east and west of the centre. The
ratios of the most robustly determined elements to iron are consistent with
Solar ratios, indicating that there has been enrichment by both Type Ia and
Type II supernovae. For a normal initial stellar mass function it represents
the products of about 4x10^10 solar masses of star formation. This star
formation can have occured either continuously at a rate of 5 solar masses per
year for the past 8 Gyr or more,or was part of the formation of the central
galaxy at earlier times. Either conclusion requires that the inner core of the
Centaurus cluster has not suffered a major disruption within the past 8 Gyr, or
even longer.",2006-07-06T15:33:22Z
"Astrochemical confirmation of the rapid evolution of massive YSOs and
  explanation for the inferred ages of hot cores","Aims. To understand the roles of infall and protostellar evolution on the
envelopes of massive young stellar objects (YSOs).
  Methods. The chemical evolution of gas and dust is traced, including infall
and realistic source evolution. The temperatures are determined
self-consistently. Both ad/desorption of ices using recent laboratory
temperature-programmed-desorption measurements are included.
  Results. The observed water abundance jump near 100 K is reproduced by an
evaporation front which moves outward as the luminosity increases. Ion-molecule
reactions produce water below 100 K. The age of the source is constrained to t
\~ 8 +/- 4 x 10^4 yrs since YSO formation. It is shown that the chemical
age-dating of hot cores at ~ few x 10^3 - 10^4 yr and the disappearance of hot
cores on a timescale of ~ 10^5 yr is a natural consequence of infall in a
dynamic envelope and protostellar evolution. Dynamical structures of ~ 350AU
such as disks should contain most of the complex second generation species. The
assumed order of desorption kinetics does not affect these results.",2006-05-15T19:58:48Z
Abundance studies of sdB stars using UV echelle HST/STIS spectroscopy,"Aims: We test the hypothesis that the pulsations in sdB stars are correlated
with the surface abundances of iron-group elements. Any correlation might
explain why, when given two spectroscopically similar stars, one will pulsate
while the other will not. Methods: We have obtained high-resolution ultraviolet
spectra two pulsating and three non-pulsating sdB stars using the Space
Telescope Imaging Spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. We
determined abundances for 25 elements including the iron group and even heavier
elements such as tin and lead using LTE curve-of-growth and spectrum synthesis
techniques. Results: We find no clear correlation between pulsations and metal
abundances, and we comment on the resulting implications, including whether it
is possible to determine the difference between a pulsating and a non-pulsating
sdB spectroscopically. In addition to the main goal of our observations, we
have also investigated the effect of supersolar metallicity on fundamental
parameter determination, possible trends with iron abundance, and the
hypothesis that weak winds may be selectively removing elements from the
stellar envelopes. These effects provide challenges to stellar atmosphere
modelling and diffusion models for sdB stars.",2006-03-02T23:32:43Z
New constrains on Gliese 86 B,"We present the results of multi epochs imaging observations of the companion
to the planetary host Gliese 86. Associated to radial velocity measurements,
this study aimed at characterizing dynamically the orbital properties and the
mass of this companion (here after Gliese 86 B), but also at investigating the
possible history of this particular system. We used the adaptive optics
instrument NACO at the ESO Very Large Telescope to obtain deep coronographic
imaging in order to determine new photometric and astrometric measurements of
Gliese 86 B. Part of the orbit is resolved. The photometry of Gliese B
indicates colors compatible with a ~70 Jupiter mass brown dwarf or a white
dwarf. Both types of objects allow to fit the available, still limited
astrometric data. Besides, if we attribute the long term radial velocity
residual drift observed for Gliese A to B, then the mass of the latter object
is ~0.5 Msun. We analyse both astrometric and radial velocity data to propose
first orbital parameters for Gliese B. Assuming Gliese B is a ~0.5 Msun white
dwarf, we explore the constraints induced by this hypothesis and refine the
parameters of the system.",2006-06-07T19:44:56Z
"Black Hole-Neutron Star Binary Merger Calculations: GRB Progenitors and
  the Stability of Mass Transfer","We have calculated the first dynamical evolutions of merging black
hole-neutron star binaries that treat the combined spacetime in a
nonperturbative general relativistic framework. Using the conformal flatness
approximation, we have studied how the location of the tidal disruption radius
with respect to the the black hole horizon and innermost stable circular orbit
(ISCO) affects the qualitative evolution of the system. Based on simple
arguments, we show that for a binary mass ratio q>~0.24, tidal disruption
occurs outside the ISCO, while the opposite is true for q<~0.24. When tidal
disruption occurs sufficiently far outside the ISCO, mass is transferred
unstably from the neutron star to the black hole, resulting in the complete
disruption of the neutron star. When tidal disruption occurs slightly within
the ISCO, we find that some of the mass forms an extremely hot disk around the
black hole. The resulting configurations in this case are excellent candidates
for the progenitors of short-hard gamma ray bursts.",2006-05-19T20:00:15Z
"X-ray and optical bursts and flares in YSOs: results from a 5-day
  XMM-Newton monitoring campaign of L1551","We present the results of a five-day monitoring campaign with XMM-Newton of
six X-ray bright young stellar objects (YSOs) in the star-forming complex L1551
in Taurus. All stars present significant variability on the five-day time
scale. Modulation of the light curve on time scales comparable with the star's
rotational period appeared to be present in the case of one weak-lined T Tauri
star. Significant spectral variations between the 2000 and the 2004
observations were detected in the (unresolved) classical T Tauri binary system
XZ Tau: a hot plasma component which was present in the X-ray spectrum in 2000
had significantly weakened in 2004. As XZ Tau N was undergoing a strong optical
outburst in 2000, which had terminated since then, we speculate on the possible
relationship between episodic, burst accretion, and X-ray heating. The
transition object HL Tau underwent a strong flare with a complex temperature
evolution, which is indicative of an event confined within a very large
magnetic structure (few stellar radii), similar to the ones found in YSOs in
the Orion Nebula Cluster.",2006-03-23T10:15:15Z
Are Gamma-ray Bursts Universal?,"It is noted that the Liang-Zhang correlation can be accounted for with the
viewing angle interpretation proposed earlier. The Ghirlanda correlation,
recently generalized by Nava et al (2006) to a wind profile, can be accounted
for by the viewing angle interpretation accordingly generalized to a wind
profile. Most of the scatter in the spectra and time-integrated brightness in
$\gamma$-ray bursts (GRB) can thus be accounted for by variation in two
parameters, 1) the viewing angle and 2) the jet opening angle, with very little
variation in any other intrinsic parameters. The scatter in apparent isotropic
equivalent fluence and other parameters is reduced by a factor of order 30 when
each of these parameters is considered. Possible difficulties with alternative
explanations are briefly discussed. It is also noted that the relative scatter
in the Amati and Ghirlanda correlations suggests certain conclusions about the
inner engine.",2006-06-08T18:48:57Z
"Three-Dimensional Simulations of Spherical Accretion Flows with
  Small-Scale Magnetic Fields","Spherical (nonrotating) accretion flows with small-scale magnetic fields have
been investigated using three-dimensional, time-dependent MHD simulations.
These simulations have been designed to model high-resolution (quasi) steady
accretion flows in a wedge computational domain that represents a small
fraction of the full spherical domain. Subsonic and supersonic
(super-fast-magnetosonic) accretion flows have been considered. Two accretion
regimes have been studied: conservative, or radiatively inefficient, and
nonconservative, in which the heat released in magnetic reconnections is
completely lost. The flows in both regimes are turbulent. They show the
flattened radial density profiles and reduction of the accretion velocities and
mass accretion rates in comparison with hydrodynamic Bondi flows. In the
conservative regime, the turbulence is more intensive and supported mostly by
thermal convection. In the nonconservative regime, the turbulence is less
intensive and supported by magnetic buoyancy and various magnetic interactions.
We have concluded that steady, supersonic spherical accretion cannot be
developed in the presence of small-scale magnetic fields.",2006-06-08T15:01:44Z
Isothermal shocks in Abell 2199 and 2A 0335+096?,"We report on a partially circular X-ray surface brightness discontinuity
found at about 55 kpc from the centre of Abell 2199 with Chandra X-ray
observatory observations. Unlike cold fronts found in other clusters, the
feature shows no significant temperature change across it but has an apparent
density jump. We therefore identify it as a weak isothermal shock associated
with the central AGN and the inflation of its radio bubbles, as found in the
Perseus cluster. We examine a similar feature at 40 kpc radius found by
Mazzotta et al in 2A 0335+096, and conclude that it too may be an isothermal
shock. The change in density if these are shocks implies a Mach number of ~1.5.
If the isothermal nature of these features is confirmed by deeper observations,
the implication is that such shocks are common in clusters of galaxies, and are
an important mechanism for the transport of energy from a central supermassive
black hole into the cluster core.",2006-05-12T15:49:46Z
The opaque nascent starburst in NGC 1377: Spitzer SINGS observations,"We analyze extensive data on NGC1377 from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby
Galaxies Survey (SINGS). Within the category of nascent starbursts, that we
previously selected by their infrared to radio continuum ratios in large excess
of the average and their hot dust, NGC1377 has the largest infrared excess yet
measured. Optical imaging reveals a morphological distortion suggestive of a
recent accretion event. Infrared spectroscopy reveals a compact and opaque
source dominated by a hot, self-absorbed continuum (tau ~ 20 in the 10 micron
silicate band). We provide physical evidence against non-stellar activity being
the heating source. HII regions are detected through the single [NeII] line,
probing <1% of the ionizing radiation. Not only is the optical depth very high,
but >85% of ionizing photons are suppressed by dust. The only other detected
emission features are molecular hydrogen lines, arguably excited mainly by
shocks, besides photodissociation regions, and weak aromatic bands. The new
observations support our interpretation in terms of an extremely young
starburst (<1 Myr). More generally, galaxies deficient in radio synchrotron are
likely observed within a few Myr of the onset of a starburst and after a long
quiescence, prior to the replenishment of the ISM with cosmic rays. The similar
infrared-radio properties of NGC1377 and some infrared-luminous galaxies
suggest that NGC1377 constitutes an archetype to better understand starburst
evolution. Although rare locally because observed in a brief evolutionary
stage, nascent starbursts may represent a non-negligible fraction of
merger-induced starbursts dominating deep infrared counts. Since they differ
dramatically from usual starburst templates, they bear important consequences
for the interpretation of deep surveys.",2006-04-12T11:48:05Z
"Core Structure of Intracluster Gas: Effects of Radiative Cooling on Core
  Sizes","We investigate the core structure of radiatively cooling intracluster gas,
using a hydrodynamics code. We calculate evolution of model clusters of the
initial core radii 160--300 kpc until the initial central cooling time, and
analyze the resultant clusters using the double beta-model as done by
observational studies. It is found that the core-size distribution thus
obtained shows two peaks \sim 30--100 kpc and \sim 100--300 kpc and marginally
can reproduce the observed distribution which exhibits two distinct peaks
around \sim 50 kpc and \sim 200 kpc. This result may suggest radiative-cooling
origin for small cores, while cooling is yet insignificant in the clusters of
large cores. It should be noted that the small core peak is reproduced by
clusters that are still keeping quasi-hydrostatic balance before the initial
central cooling time has elapsed.",2006-04-10T11:26:31Z
Exotic bulk viscosity and its influence on neutron star r-modes,"We investigate the effect of exotic matter in particular, hyperon matter on
neutron star properties such as equation of state (EoS), mass-radius
relationship and bulk viscosity. Here we construct equations of state within
the framework of a relativistic field theoretical model. As hyperons are
produced abundantly in dense matter, hyperon-hyperon interaction becomes
important and is included in this model. Hyperon-hyperon interaction gives rise
to a softer EoS which results in a smaller maximum mass neutron star compared
with the case without the interaction. Next we compute the coefficient of bulk
viscosity and the corresponding damping time scale due to the non-leptonic weak
process including $\Lambda$ hyperons. Further, we investigate the role of the
bulk viscosity on gravitational radiation driven r-mode instability in a
neutron star of given mass and temperature and find that the instability is
effectively suppressed.",2006-07-01T11:59:48Z
"The Holmberg effect of Main galaxy pairs of the SDSS Data Release 4
  (SDSS4)","We have investigated the Holmberg effect of Main galaxy pairs of the SDSS
Data Release 4 (SDSS4). It is found that except i-z color the color indices
between the two components of Main galaxy pairs clearly have significantly
larger correlation coefficients. Further analyses also show that the Holmberg
Effect of galaxies not only depends on the color indices but also on the
morphological type for two components of pairs.",2006-05-12T23:33:27Z
"Observational constraints on modified gravity models and the Poincaré
  dodecahedral topology","We study the constraints that spatial topology may place on the parameters of
models that account for the accelerated expansion of the universe via infrared
modifications to general relativity, namely the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati
braneworld model as well as the Dvali-Turner and Cardassian models. By
considering the Poincar\'e dodecahedral space as the circles-in-the-sky
observable spatial topology, we examine the constraints that can be placed on
the parameters of each model using type Ia supernovae data together with the
baryon acoustic peak in the large scale correlation function of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey of luminous red galaxies and the Cosmic Microwave Background
Radiation shift parameter data. We show that knowledge of spatial topology does
provide relevant constraints, particularly on the curvature parameter, for all
models.",2006-03-31T15:23:36Z
"Accretion onto Supermassive Black Holes in Quasars: Learning from
  Optical/UV Observations","Accretion processes in quasars and active galactic nuclei are still poorly
understood, especially as far as the connection between observed spectral
properties and physical parameters is concerned. Quasars show an additional
degree of complexity compared to stars that is related to anisotropic
emission/obscuration influencing the observed properties in most spectral
ranges. This complicating factor has hampered efforts to define the equivalent
of an Hertzsprung-Russel diagram for quasars. Even if it has recently become
possible to estimate black hole mass and Eddington ratio for sources using
optical and UV broad emission lines, the results are still plagued by large
uncertainties. Nevertheless, robust trends are emerging from multivariate
analysis of large spectral datasets of quasars. A firm observational basis is
being laid out by accurate measurements of broad emission line properties
especially when the source rest-frame is known. We consider the most widely
discussed correlations (i.e. the so-called ""eigenvector 1 parameter space"" and
the ""Baldwin effect"") and analyze how they can be explained in terms of
accretion properties, broad line region structure, and source evolution. We
critically review recent estimates of black hole mass, accretion rate, spin and
possible orientation indicators, stressing that any improvement in these
parameters will provide a much better understanding of the physics and dynamics
of the region producing the optical and UV broad emission lines. More accurate
measurements of Eddington ratio and black hole mass may have a significant
impact on our ideas about evolution of quasar properties with redshift and
luminosity as well as on broader cosmological issues.",2006-06-28T07:07:36Z
"Formation of Galactic Systems in Light of the Magnesium Abundance in
  Field Stars: The Thin Disk","We analyze the relations between the relative magnesium abundances in stars
and their metallicities, Galactic orbital elements, and ages. The relative
magnesium abundances in metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -0.4) thin-disk stars have been
found to systematically decrease with increasing stellar orbital radii in such
a way that magnesium over abundances ([Mg/Fe]>0.2 dex) are essentially observed
only in the stars whose orbits lie almost entirely within the solar circle. At
the same time, the range of metallicities in magnesium-poor stars is displaced
from (-0.5<[Fe/H]<+0.3 dex) to (-0.7<[Fe/H]<+0.2 dex) as their orbital radii
increase. This behavior suggests that, first, the star formation rate decreases
with increasing Galactocentric distance and, second, there was no star
formation for some time outside the solar circle while this process was
continuous within the solar circle. The decrease in the star formation rate
with increasing Galactocentric distance is responsible for the existence of a
negative radial metallicity gradient (grad_{R}[Fe/H]=(-0.05 \pm 0.01) kpc^{-1})
in the disk, which shows a tendency to increase with decreasing age. At the
same time the relative magnesium abundance exhibits no radial gradient. We have
confirmed the existence of a steep negative vertical metallicity gradient
(grad_Z [Fe/H]=(-0.29 \pm 0.06) kpc^{-1}) and detected a significant positive
vertical gradient in relative magnesium abundance (grad_Z [Mg/Fe]=(0.13 \pm
0.02) kpc^{-1}); both gradients increase appreciably in absolute value with
decreasing age. We have found that there is not only an age-metallicity
relation, but also an age-magnesium abundance relation in the thin disk.",2006-04-26T22:29:45Z
Identification of New M Dwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood,"We present the results from a spectroscopic study of 1080 nearby active M
dwarfs, selected by correlating the 2MASS and ROSAT catalogs. We have derived
the spectral types and estimated distances for all of our stars. The spectral
types range between K5 and M6. Nearly half of our stars lie within 50 pc. We
have measured the equivalent width of the H alpha emission line. Our targets
show an increase in chromospheric activity from early to mid-spectral types,
with a peak in activity around M5. Using the count rate and hardness ratios
obtained from the ROSAT catalog, we have derived the X-ray luminosities. Our
stars display a ""saturation-type"" relation between the chromospheric and
coronal activity. The relation is such that log (Lx/Lbol) remains ""saturated""
at a value of about -3 for varying H alpha equivalent width. We have found 568
matches in the USNO-B catalog, and have derived the tangential velocities for
these stars. There is a slight trend of decreasing chromospheric activity with
age, such that the stars with higher Vtan have lower H alpha equivalent widths.
The coronal emission, however, remains saturated at a value of log (Lx/Lbol) -3
for varying tangential velocities, suggesting that the coronal activity remains
saturated with age. We do not find any break in the saturation-type relation at
the spectral type where stars become fully convective (~M3.5). Most of the
stars in our sample show more coronal emission than the dMe stars in the Hyades
and Praesepe clusters, and have Vtan< 40km/s, suggesting a young population.",2006-06-26T05:11:29Z
AGN Jet Mass Loading and Truncation by Stellar Winds,"Active Galactic Nuclei can produce extremely powerful jets. While tightly
collimated, the scale of these jets and the stellar density at galactic centers
implies that there will be many jet/star interactions, which can mass-load the
jet through stellar winds. Previous work employed modest wind mass outflow
rates, but this does not apply when mass loading is provided by a small number
of high mass-loss stars. We construct a framework for jet mass-loading by
stellar winds for a broader spectrum of wind mass-loss rates than has been
previously considered. Given the observed stellar mass distributions in
galactic centers, we find that even highly efficient (0.1 Eddington luminosity)
jets from supermassive black holes of masses $M_{BH} \la 10^4M_{\odot}$ are
rapidly mass loaded and quenched by stellar winds. For $10^4
M_{\odot}<M_{BH}<10^8 M_{\odot}$, the quenching length of highly efficient jets
is independent of the jet's mechanical luminosity. Stellar wind mass-loading is
unable to quench efficient jets from more massive engines, but can account for
the observed truncation of the inefficient M87 jet, and implies a baryon
dominated composition on scales $\ga 2$ kpc therein even if the jet is
initially pair plasma dominated.",2006-04-28T19:05:11Z
Modelling of asymmetric nebulae. II. Line profiles,"We present a tool, VELNEB_3D, which can be applied to the results of 3D
photoionization codes to generate emission line profiles, position-velocity
maps and 3D maps in any emission line by assuming an arbitrary velocity field.
  We give a few examples, based on our pseudo-3D photoionization code NEBU_3D
(Morisset, Stasinska and Pena, 2005) which show the potentiality and usefulness
of our tool. One example shows how complex line profiles can be obtained even
with a simple expansion law if the nebula is bipolar and the slit slightly
off-center. Another example shows different ways to produce line profiles that
could be attributed to a turbulent velocity field while there is no turbulence
in the model. A third example shows how, in certain circumstances, it is
possible to discriminate between two very different geometrical structures --
here a face-on blister and its ``spherical impostor'' -- when using appropriate
high resolution spectra. Finally, we show how our tool is able to generate 3D
maps, similar to the ones that can be obtained by observing extended nebulae
with integral field units.",2006-05-17T00:23:44Z
"Towards observational constraints on negative (1+z)^4 type contribution
  in the Friedmann equation","We discuss certain issues related to the limitations of density parameters
for a ``radiation''-like contribution to the Friedmann equation using
kinematical or geometrical measurements. We analyse the observational
constraint of a negative $(1+z)^4$-type contribution in cosmological models. We
argue that it is not possible to determine the energy densities of individual
components of matter scaling like radiation from astronomical observations. We
find three different interpretations of the presence of the radiation term: 1)
the FRW universe filled with a massless scalar field in a quantum regime (the
Casimir effect), 2) the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) model in the Randall
Sundrum scenario with dark radiation, 3) the cosmological model with global
rotation. From supernovae type Ia (SNIa) data, Fanaroff-Riley type IIb (FRIIb)
radio galaxy (RG) data, baryon oscillation peak and cosmic microwave background
radiation (CMBR) observations we obtain bounds for the negative radiation-like
term. A small negative contribution of dark radiation can reconcile the tension
in nucleosynthesis and remove also the disagreement between $H_0$ values
obtained from both SNIa and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)
satellite data.",2006-06-29T18:12:36Z
Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation of Solar Supergranulation,"Three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical large eddy simulations of solar
surface convection using realistic model physics is conducted. The effects of
magnetic fields on thermal structure of convective motions into radiative
layers, the range of convection cell sizes and penetration depths of convection
is investigated. We simulate a some portion of the solar photosphere and the
upper layers of the convection zone, a region extending 30 x 30 Mm horizontally
from 0 Mm down to 18 Mm below the visible surface. We solve equations of the
fully compressible radiation magnetohydrodynamics with dynamical viscosity and
gravity. For numerical simulation we use: 1)realistic initial model of Sun and
equation of state and opacities of stellar matter, 2) high order conservative
TVD scheme for solution magnetohydrodynamics, 3) diffusion approximation for
solution radiative transfer 4) calculation dynamical viscosity from subgrid
scale modelling. Simulations are conducted on horizontal uniform grid of 320 x
320 and with 144 nonuniformly spaced vertical grid points on the 128 processors

Academy of Sciences.",2006-05-24T15:00:08Z
"Stellar populations of early-type galaxies in different environments
  III. Line-strength gradients","We present line-strength gradients for 22 spectral indices measured in a
sample of 82 early-type galaxies in different environments,including the
high-density core of the Coma cluster, the Virgo cluster,poor groups,and field
galaxies. We derive age and metallicity gradients, and compare the mean values
with the predictions of different galaxy formation models. We explore the
behaviour of individual chemical species by deriving the metallicity gradient
with different indicators.We find that the strength of the metallicity gradient
inferred from stellar population models depends on the specific Lick index
employed. In particular, metallicity gradients obtained with CN2 and C4668
combined with Hb are steeper than when measured using Ca4227 or Fe4383. The
correlation of the metallicity gradients with other parameters also depends on
the specific index employed. If the metallicity gradient is obtained using CN2
and Mgb then it correlates with the central age of the galaxies. On the
contrary, if Fe4383 or Ca4227 are used, the metallicity gradient correlates
with the velocity dispersion gradient.This may suggests that several mechanism
have helped to set the age and metallicity gradients in early-type galaxies.
While we do not find any correlation between the metallicity gradient and the
central velocity dispersion for galaxies in low-density environments, we find a
marginal correlation between the metallicity gradient and the mass for galaxies
in the centre of the Coma cluster. We also find a trend for which galaxies in
denser environments show a steeper metallicity gradient than galaxies in less
dense environments.We interpret these results in light of the different models
to explain the differences between galaxies as a function of environment.",2006-04-27T14:49:43Z
Accelerated expansion from structure formation,"We discuss the physics of backreaction-driven accelerated expansion. Using
the exact equations for the behaviour of averages in dust universes, we explain
how large-scale smoothness does not imply that the effect of inhomogeneity and
anisotropy on the expansion rate is small. We demonstrate with an analytical
toy model how gravitational collapse can lead to acceleration. We find that the
conjecture of the accelerated expansion being due to structure formation is in
agreement with the general observational picture of structures in the universe,
and more quantitative work is needed to make a detailed comparison.",2006-07-27T19:11:18Z
Spectral diversity of Type Ia Supernovae,"We use published spectroscopic and photometric data for 8 Type Ia supernovae
to construct a dispersion spectrum for this class of object, showing their
diversity over the wavelength range 3700A to 7100A. We find that the B and V
bands are the spectral regions with the least dispersion, while the U band
below 4100A is more diverse. Some spectral features such as the Si line at
6150A are also highly diverse. We then construct two objective measures of
'peculiarity' by (i) using the deviation of individual objects from the average
SN Ia spectrum compared to the typical dispersion and (ii) applying principle
component analysis. We demonstrate these methods on several SNe Ia that have
previously been classified as peculiar.",2006-05-05T05:04:08Z
"Metal-Rich Globular Clusters: an Unaccounted Factor Responsible for
  Their Formation?","Presently unaccounted but quite probable ""chemical factor"" may be responsible
for the formation of old metal-rich globular clusters (MRGCs) in spheroids, as
well as of their conterparts, young (intermediate-age) massive star clusters
(MSCs) in irregulars. Their formation presumably occurs at the same stage of
the host galaxies' chemical evolution and is related to the essentially
increased SF activity in the hosts around the same metallicity, Zsol/3
([Fe/H]~-0.5). It is achieved very soon in massive spheroids, later in
lower-mass spheroids, and (much) more later in irregulars.",2006-05-03T20:56:26Z
"Spitzer/MIPS Imaging of NGC 650: Probing the History of Mass Loss on the
  Asymptotic Giant Branch","We present the far-infrared (IR) maps of a bipolar planetary nebula (PN), NGC
650, at 24, 70, and 160 micron taken with the Multiband Imaging Photometer for
Spitzer (MIPS) on-board the Spitzer Space Telescope. While the two-peak
emission structure seen in all MIPS bands suggests the presence of a near
edge-on dusty torus, the distinct emission structure between the 24 micron map
and the 70/160 micron maps indicates the presence of two distinct emission
components in the central torus. Based on the spatial correlation of these two
far-IR emission components with respect to various optical line emission, we
conclude that the 24 micron emission is largely due to the [O IV] line at 25.9
micron arising from highly ionized regions behind the ionization front, whereas
the 70 and 160 micron emission is due to dust continuum arising from
low-temperature dust in the remnant asymptotic giant branch (AGB) wind shell.
The far-IR nebula structure also suggests that the enhancement of mass loss at
the end of the AGB phase has occurred isotropically, but has ensued only in the
equatorial directions while ceasing in the polar directions. The present data
also show evidence for the prolate spheroidal distribution of matter in this
bipolar PN. The AGB mass loss history reconstructed in this PN is thus
consistent with what has been previously proposed based on the past optical and
mid-IR imaging surveys of the post-AGB shells.",2006-06-21T19:58:21Z
Dark matter clustering: a simple renormalization group approach,"I compute a renormalization group (RG) improvement to the standard
beyond-linear-order Eulerian perturbation theory (PT) calculation of the power
spectrum of large-scale density fluctuations in the Universe. At z=0, for a
power spectrum matching current observations, lowest order RGPT appears to be
as accurate as one can test using existing numerical simulation-calibrated
fitting formulas out to at least k~=0.3 h/Mpc; although inaccuracy is
guaranteed at some level by approximations in the calculation (which can be
improved in the future). In contrast, standard PT breaks down virtually as soon
as beyond-linear corrections become non-negligible, on scales even larger than
k=0.1 h/Mpc. This extension in range of validity could substantially enhance
the usefulness of PT for interpreting baryonic acoustic oscillation surveys
aimed at probing dark energy, for example. I show that the predicted power
spectrum converges at high k to a power law with index given by the fixed-point
solution of the RG equation. I discuss many possible future directions for this
line of work. The basic calculation of this paper should be easily
understandable without any prior knowledge of RG methods, while a rich
background of mathematical physics literature exists for the interested reader.",2006-06-01T19:47:17Z
"Exoplanet detection with simultaneous spectral differential imaging:
  effects of out-of-pupil-plane optical aberrations","Imaging faint companions (exoplanets and brown dwarfs) around nearby stars is
currently limited by speckle noise. To efficiently attenuate this noise, a
technique called simultaneous spectral differential imaging (SSDI) can be used.
This technique consists of acquiring simultaneously images of the field of view
in several adjacent narrow bands and in combining these images to suppress
speckles. Simulations predict that SSDI can achieve, with the acquisition of
three wavelengths, speckle noise attenuation of several thousands. These
simulations are usually performed using the Fraunhofer approximation, i.e.
considering that all aberrations are located in the pupil plane. We have
performed wavefront propagation simulations to evaluate how out-of-pupil-plane
aberrations affect SSDI speckle noise attenuation performance. The Talbot
formalism is used to give a physical insight of the problem; results are
confirmed using a proper wavefront propagation algorithm. We will show that
near-focal-plane aberrations can significantly reduce SSDI speckle noise
attenuation performance at several lambda/D separation. It is also shown that
the Talbot effect correctly predicts the PSF chromaticity. Both differential
atmospheric refraction effects and the use of a coronagraph will be discussed.",2006-06-30T21:27:11Z
"Spitzer/MIPS 24 micron galaxies: the link to near-IR galaxies and the
  cosmic IR background","We present the results of our most recent works on Spitzer/MIPS 24 micron
galaxies. Through a multiwavelength analysis, we study different properties
(redshifts, luminosities, stellar masses) characterising the sources which
produce the bulk of the mid-IR background. From a comparative study with the
total population of Ks-selected galaxies, we determine that 24 micron sources
account for an important fraction of the most massive galaxies present at
different redshifts. On the other hand, we determine that 24 micron galaxies
also produce most of the energy contained in the far-IR cosmic background at 70
and 160 microns. Furthermore, we are able to set tight constraints on the
Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) spectral energy distribution (SED). Our
results help to clarify the links between these presumably different IR galaxy
populations.",2006-04-11T11:10:21Z
"The Influence of Mass and Environment on the Evolution of Early-Type
  Galaxies","We report on a uniform comparative analysis of the fundamental parameters of
early-type galaxies at z~1 down to a well defined magnitude limit (M_B\leq
-20.0 in the field and M_B\leq -20.5 in the clusters). The changes in the M/L_B
ratio from z~1 to today are larger for lower mass galaxies in all environments,
and are similar in the field and in the clusters for galaxies with the same
mass. By deriving ages from the M}/L_B ratio, we estimate the formation
redshift for early-type galaxies as a function of galaxy mass and environment.
We find that the age of early-type galaxies increases with galaxy mass
(downsizing) in all environments, and that cluster galaxies appear to have the
same age within 5% as field galaxies at any given galaxy mass. The first result
confirms similar ones obtained by other means, while the second one is
controversial. The most recent incarnation of the hierarchical models of galaxy
formation and evolution is capable of explaining the first result, but predicts
that cluster galaxies should be older than field galaxies. We also find a total
lack of massive early--type galaxies M>3 10^{11} M_{\sun}) with a formation
redshift smaller than 2, which cannot be due to selection effects.",2006-07-11T16:05:22Z
"Discovery of an X-ray Jet and Extended Jet Structure in the Quasar PKS
  1055+201","This letter reports rich X-ray jet structures found in the Chandra
observation of PKS 1055+201. In addition to an X-ray jet coincident with the
radio jet we detect a region of extended X-ray emission surrounding the jet as
far from the core as the radio hotspot to the North, and a similar extended
X-ray region along the presumed path of the unseen counterjet to the Southern
radio lobe. Both X-ray regions show a similar curvature to the west, relative
to the quasar. We interpret this as the first example where we separately
detect the X-ray emission from a narrow jet and extended, residual jet plasma
over the entire length of a powerful FRII jet.",2006-07-12T20:51:47Z
"GALEX and Optical Light Curves of EF Eridanus During a Low State: the
  Puzzling Source of UV Light","Low state optical photometry of EF Eri during an extended low accretion state
combined with GALEX near and far UV time-resolved photometry reveals a source
of UV flux that is much larger than the underlying 9500K white dwarf, and that
is highly modulated on the orbital period. The near UV and optical light curves
can be modeled with a 20,000K spot but no spot model can explain both the large
amplitude FUV variations and the SED. The limitations of limb darkening,
cyclotron and magnetic white dwarf models in explaining the observations are
discussed.",2006-06-21T20:34:21Z
"Thermal and non-thermal components of the interstellar medium at
  sub-kiloparsec scales in galaxies","Aims: We present new radio continuum observations of ten BIMA SONG galaxies,
taken at 1.4 GHz with the Very Large Array. These observations allow us to
extend the study of the relationships between the radio continuum (RC) and CO
emission to 22 CO luminous galaxies for which single dish CO images have been
added to interferometric data. New Spitzer infrared (IR) images of six of these
galaxies have been released. The analysis of these high resolution images
allowed us to probe the RC-IR-CO correlations down to linear scales of a few
hundred pc. Results: for the 22 galaxies analysed, the RC-CO correlation on
scales from $\sim10$ kpc down to $\sim100$ pc is nearly linear and has a
scatter of a factor of two, i.e. comparable to that of the global correlations.
There is no evidence for any severe degradation of the scatter below the kpc
scale. This also applies to the six galaxies for which high-resolution mid-IR
data are available. In the case of NGC 5194, we find that the non-thermal radio
spectral index is correlated with the RC/FIR ratio. Conclusions: The scatter of
the point-by-point correlations does not increase significantly with spatial
resolution. We thus conclude that we have not yet probed the physical scales at
which the correlations break down. However, we observe local deviations from
the correlations in regions with a high star formation rate, such as the spiral
arms, where we observe a flat radio spectrum and a low RC/FIR ratio. In the
intra-arm regions and in the peripheral regions of the disk, the RC/FIR is
generally higher and it is characterized by a steepening of the radio spectrum.",2006-06-20T12:42:43Z
"Variability of the NGC 1333 IRAS 4A Outflow: Molecular Hydrogen and
  Silicon Monoxide Images","The NGC 1333 region was observed in the H2 1-0 S(1) line. The H2 images cover
a 5' x 7' region around IRAS 4. Numerous H2 emission features were detected.
The northeast-southwest bipolar outflow driven by IRAS 4A was studied by
combining the H2 images with SiO maps published previously. The SiO-H2 outflows
are continuous on the southwestern side but show a gap on the northeastern
side. The southwestern outflow lobe curves smoothly, and the position angle
increases with the distance from the driving source. The base and the outer tip
of the northeastern outflow lobe are located at positions opposite to the
corresponding parts of the southwestern lobe. This point-symmetry suggests that
the outflow axis may be drifting or precessing clockwise in the plane of the
sky and that the cause of the axis drift may be intrinsic to the outflow
engine. The axis drift model is supported by the asymmetric lateral intensity
profile of the SiO outflow. The axis drift rate is about 0.011 deg yr-1. The
middle part of the northeastern outflow does not exactly follow the point
symmetry because of the superposition of two different kinds of directional
variability: the axis drift of the driving source and the deflection by a dense
core. The axis drift model provides a good explanation for the large deflection
angle of the northeastern outflow. Other H2 emission features around the IRAS 4
region are discussed briefly. Some of them are newly found outflows, and some
are associated with outflows already known before.",2006-04-19T04:09:16Z
Seismic signatures of strange stars with crust,"We study acoustic oscillations (eigenfrequencies, velocity distributions,
damping times) of normal crusts of strange stars. These oscillations are very
specific because of huge density jump at the interface between the normal crust
and the strange matter core. The oscillation problem is shown to be
self-similar. For a low (but non-zero) multipolarity l the fundamental mode
(without radial nodes) has a frequency ~300 Hz and mostly horizontal
oscillation velocity; other pressure modes have frequencies >=20 kHz and almost
radial oscillation velocities. The latter modes are similar to radial
oscillations (have approximately the same frequencies and radial velocity
profiles). The oscillation spectrum of strange stars with crust differs from
the spectrum of neutron stars. If detected, acoustic oscillations would allow
one to discriminate between strange stars with crust and neutron stars and
constrain the mass and radius of the star.",2006-06-13T12:51:13Z
"Gravity's Relentless Pull: An interactive, multimedia website about
  black holes for Education and Public Outreach","We have created a website, called ""Black Holes: Gravity's Relentless Pull"",
which explains the physics and astronomy of black holes for a general audience.
The site emphasizes user participation and is rich in animations and
astronomical imagery. It won the top prize of the 2005 Pirelli INTERNETional
Awards competition for the best communication of science and technology using
the internet. This article provides a brief overview of the site. The site
starts with an opening animation that introduces the basic concept of a black
hole. The user is then invited to embark on a journey from a backyard view of
the night sky to a personal encounter with a singularity. This journey proceeds
through three modules, which allow the user to: find black holes in the night
sky; travel to a black hole in an animated starship; and explore a black hole
from up close. There are also five ""experiments"" that allow the user to: create
a black hole; orbit around a black hole; weigh a black hole; drop a clock into
a black hole; or fall into a black hole. The modules and experiments offer
goal-based scenarios tailored for novices and children. The site also contains
an encyclopedia of frequently asked questions and a detailed glossary that are
targeted more at experts and adults. The overall result is a website where
scientific knowledge, learning theory, and fun converge. Despite its focus on
black holes, the site also teaches many other concepts of physics, astronomy
and scientific thought. The site aims to instill an appreciation for learning
and an interest in science, especially in the younger users. It can be used as
an aid in teaching introductory astronomy at the undergraduate level.",2006-06-23T20:44:27Z
Water vapor on supergiants. The 12 micron TEXES spectra of mu Cephei,"Several recent papers have argued for warm, semi-detached, molecular layers
surrounding red giant and supergiant stars, a concept known as a MOLsphere.
Spectroscopic and interferometric analyses have often corroborated this general
picture. Here, we present high-resolution spectroscopic data of pure rotational
lines of water vapor at 12 microns for the supergiant mu Cephei. This star has
often been used to test the concept of molecular layers around supergiants.
Given the prediction of an isothermal, optically thick water-vapor layer in
Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium around the star (MOLsphere), we expected the 12
micron lines to be in emission or at least in absorption but filled in by
emission from the molecular layer around the star. Our data, however, show the
contrary; we find definite absorption. Thus, our data do not easily fit into
the suggested isothermal MOLsphere scenario. The 12 micron lines, therefore,
put new, strong constraints on the MOLsphere concept and on the nature of water
seen in signatures across the spectra of early M supergiants. We also find that
the absorption is even stronger than that calculated from a standard,
spherically symmetric model photosphere without any surrounding layers. A cool
model photosphere, representing cool outer layers is, however, able to
reproduce the lines, but this model does not account for water vapor emission
at 6 microns. Thus, a unified model for water vapor on mu Cephei appears to be
lacking. It does seem necessary to model the underlying photospheres of these
supergiants in their whole complexity. The strong water vapor lines clearly
reveal inadequacies of classical model atmospheres.",2006-03-15T09:12:33Z
Reionization from cosmic string loops,"Loops formed from a cosmic string network at early times would act as seeds
for early formation of halos, which would form galaxies and lead to early
reionization. With reasonable guesses about astrophysical and string
parameters, the cosmic string scale $G\mu$ must be no more than about $3\times
10^{-8}$ to avoid conflict with the reionization redshift found by WMAP. The
bound is much stronger for superstring models with a small string reconnection
probability. For values near the bound, cosmic string loops may explain the
discrepancy between the WMAP value and theoretical expectations.",2006-05-18T17:00:31Z
On the Rayleigh-Taylor Instability of Radio Bubbles in Galaxy Clusters,"We consider the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in the early evolution of the
rarefied radio bubbles (cavities) observed in many cooling flow clusters of
galaxies. The top of a bubble becomes prone to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability
as the bubble rises through the intra-cluster medium (ICM). We show that while
the jet is powering the inflation, the deceleration of the bubble-ICM interface
is able to reverse the Rayleigh-Taylor instability criterion. In addition, the
inflation introduces a drag effect which increases substantially the
instability growth time. The combined action of these two effects considerably
delays the onset of the instability. Later on, when the magnitude of the
deceleration drops or the jet fades, the Rayleigh-Taylor and the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities set in and eventually disrupt the bubble. We
conclude that the initial deceleration and drag, albeit unable to prevent the
disruption of a bubble, may significantly lengthen its lifetime, removing the
need to invoke stabilising magnetic fields.",2006-05-21T06:56:37Z
Gravitational polarization and the phenomenology of MOND,"The modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) has been proposed as an alternative to
the dark matter paradigm; the philosophy behind is that there is no dark matter
and we witness a violation of the Newtonian law of dynamics. In this article,
we interpret differently the phenomenology sustaining MOND, as resulting from
an effect of ""gravitational polarization"", of some cosmic fluid made of dipole
moments, aligned in the gravitational field, and representing a new form of
dark matter. We invoke an internal force, of non-gravitational origin, in order
to hold together the microscopic constituents of the dipole. The dipolar
particles are weakly influenced by the distribution of ordinary matter; they
are accelerated not by the gravitational field, but by its gradient, or tidal
gravitational field.",2006-05-24T20:22:13Z
The Rotation of Young Low-Mass Stars and Brown Dwarfs,"We review the current state of our knowledge concerning the rotation and
angular momentum evolution of young stellar objects and brown dwarfs from a
primarily observational view point. Periods are typically accurate to 1% and
available for about 1700 stars and 30 brown dwarfs in young clusters.
Discussion of angular momentum evolution also requires knowledge of stellar
radii, which are poorly known for pre-main sequence stars. It is clear that
rotation rates at a given age depend strongly on mass; higher mass stars
(0.4-1.2 M$_\odot$) have longer periods than lower mass stars and brown dwarfs.
On the other hand, specific angular momentum is approximately independent of
mass for low mass pre-main sequence stars and young brown dwarfs. A spread of
about a factor of 30 is seen at any given mass and age. The evolution of
rotation of solar-like stars during the first 100 Myr is discussed. A broad,
bimodal distribution exists at the earliest observable phases ($\sim$1 Myr) for
stars more massive than 0.4 M$_\odot$. The rapid rotators (50-60% of the
sample) evolve to the ZAMS with little or no angular momentum loss. The slow
rotators continue to lose substantial amounts of angular momentum for up to 5
Myr, creating the even broader bimodal distribution characteristic of 30-120
Myr old clusters. Accretion disk signatures are more prevalent among slowly
rotating PMS stars, indicating a connection between accretion and rotation.
Disks appear to influence rotation for, at most, $\sim$5 Myr, and considerably
less than that for the majority of stars. If the dense clusters studied so far
are an accurate guide, then the typical solar-like star may have only $\sim$1
Myr for this task. It appears that both disk interactions and stellar winds are
less efficient at braking these objects.",2006-03-24T15:31:06Z
"Exploring Halo Substructure with Giant Stars: The Dynamics and
  Metallicity of the Dwarf Spheroidal in Bootes","We report the results of a spectroscopic study of the Bootes (Boo) dwarf
spheroidal (dSph) galaxy carried out with the WIYN telescope and the Hydra
multifiber spectrograph. Radial velocities have been measured for 58 Boo
candidate stars selected to have magnitudes and colors consistent with its red
and asymptotic giant branches. Within the 13' half-light radius, seven members
of Boo yield a systemic velocity of V_r=95.6+-3.4 km/s and a velocity
dispersion of 6.6+-2.3 km/s. This implies a mass on the order of 1 x 10^7
M_sun, similar to the inferred masses of other Galactic dSphs. Adopting a total
Boo luminosity of L=1.8 x 10^4 L_sun to 8.6 x 10^4 L_sun implies M/L ~ 610 to
130, making Boo, the most distorted known Milky Way dwarf galaxy, potentially
also the darkest. From the spectra of Boo member stars we estimate its
metallicity to be [Fe/H] ~ -2.5, which would make it the most metal poor dSph
known to date.",2006-06-12T17:55:57Z
Near-IR variability properties of a selected sample of AGB stars,"We present the results of a near-infrared monitoring programme of a selected
sample of stars, initially suspected to be Mira variables and OH/IR stars,
covering more than a decade of observations. The objects monitored cover the
typical range of IRAS colours shown by O-rich stars on the Asymptotic Giant
Branch and show a surprisingly large diversity of variability properties. 16
objects are confirmed as large-amplitude variables. Periods between 360 and
1800 days and typical amplitudes from 1 to 2 magnitudes could be determined for
nine of them. In three light curves we find a systematic decrease of the mean
brightness, two light curves show pronounced asymmetry. One source, IRAS
07222-2005, shows infrared colours typical of Mira variables but pulsates with
a much longer period (approx. 1200 days) than a normal Mira. Two objects are
ither close to (IRAS 03293+6010) or probably in (IRAS 18299-1705) the post-AGB
phase. In IRAS 16029-3041 we found a systematic increase of the H-K colour of
approximately 1 magnitude, which we interpret as evidence of a recent episode
of enhanced mass loss. IRAS 18576+0341, a heavily obscured Luminous Blue
Variable was also monitored. The star showed a continued decrease of brightness
over a period of 7 years (1995 - 2002).",2006-06-15T15:38:53Z
UBVJHK synthetic photometry of Galactic O stars,"The development of powerful infrared observational technics enables the study
of very extincted objects and young embedded star forming regions. This is
especially interesting in the context of massive stars which form and spend a
non negligible fraction of their life still enshrouded in their parental
molecular cloud. Spectrophotometric calibrations are thus necessary to
constrain the physical properties of heavily extincted objects. Here, we derive
UBVJHK magnitudes and bolometric corrections from a grid of atmosphere models
for O stars. Bessel passbands are used. Bolometric corrections (BC) are derived
as a function of Teff and are subsequently used to derive BC - spectral type
(ST) and Absolute Magnitudes - ST relations. Infrared magnitudes and, for the
first time, bolometric corrections are given for the full range of spectral
types and luminosity classes. Infrared colors are essentially constant.
Intrinsic H-K colors are 0.05 mag bluer than previously proposed. Optical
calibrations are also provided and are similar to previous work, except for
(B-V)0 which is found to be at minimum -0.28 for standard O stars, slightly
larger (0.04 mag) than commonly accepted.",2006-06-23T14:15:45Z
"Cosmological production of H_2 before the formation of the first
  galaxies","Previous calculations of the pregalactic chemistry have found that a small
amount of H_2, x[H_2]=n[H_2]/n[H] = 2.6e-6, is produced catalytically through
the H^-, H_2^+, and HeH^+ mechanisms. We revisit this standard calculation
taking into account the effects of the nonthermal radiation background produced
by cosmic hydrogen recombination, which is particularly effective at destroying
H^- via photodetachment. We also take into consideration the non-equilibrium
level populations of H_2^+, which occur since transitions among the
rotational-vibrational levels are slow compared to photodissociation. The new
calculation predicts a final H_2 abundance of x[H_2] = 6e-7 for the standard
cosmology. This production is due almost entirely to the H^- mechanism, with ~1
per cent coming from HeH^+ and ~0.004 per cent from H_2^+. We evaluate the
heating of the diffuse pregalactic gas from the chemical reactions that produce
H_2 and from rotational transitions in H_2, and find them to be negligible.",2006-06-19T05:34:17Z
Mira B Rejuvenated,"Recent ultraviolet spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Far
Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) satellites demonstrate that UV line
and continuum fluxes observed from Mira B are increasing back towards the
levels that the International Ultraviolet Explorer observed in 1979-1980 and
1990-1995, after having been found in a very low state by HST and FUSE in
1999-2001. The UV emission is associated with accretion of material onto Mira B
from Mira A's massive wind, so the variability is presumably due to variations
in accretion rate. From wind absorption features, we estimate a Mira B mass
loss rate of 2.5e-12 M_sun/yr, indicating that Mira B's wind has increased in
strength along with the accretion rate. The UV variability may be associated
with a previously reported 14-year periodicity in Mira B's optical emission.",2006-06-19T19:33:44Z
"Planetesimal formation via fragmentation in self-gravitating
  protoplanetary discs","An unsolved issue in the standard core accretion model for gaseous planet
formation is how kilometre-sized planetesimals form from, initially,
micron-sized dust grains. Solid growth beyond metre sizes can be difficult both
because the sticking efficiency becomes very small, and because these particles
should rapidly migrate into the central star. We consider here how metre-sized
particles evolve in self-gravitating accretion discs using simulations in which
the gravitational influence of the solid particles is also included.
Metre-sized particles become strongly concentrated in the spiral structures
present in the disc and, if the solid to gas density ratio is sufficiently
high, can fragment due to their own self-gravity to form planetesimals
directly. This result suggests that planetesimal formation may occur very early
in the star formation process while discs are still massive enough to be
self-gravitating. The dependence of this process on the surface density of the
solids is also consistent with the observation that extrasolar planets are
preferentially found around high metallicity stars.",2006-07-12T20:01:04Z
A fossil galaxy cluster; an X-ray and optical study of RX J1416.4+2315,"We present a detailed X-ray and optical study of a distant fossil system RX
J1416.4+2315 (z=0.13), combining Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, optical
photometry and spectroscopy. X-ray emitting hot gas imaged by both the Chandra
and XMM-Newton shows a globally relaxed spatial distribution, supporting the
idea that fossil groups are old galaxy systems with no recent mergers. However,
the diffuse X-ray emission shows signs of asymmetries in the core of the
system. With a mean gas temperature of ~ 4.0 keV and total gravitational mass
of 3.1 x 10^14 solar mass, within the virial radius, this is better described
as a fossil galaxy cluster rather than a fossil group. The temperature profile
shows no sign of a significant cooler core despite a cooling time dropping to 5
Gyr within the resolved core. We find a mass concentration parameter c_200 ~ 11
which is relatively high for a cluster of this mass, indicative of an early
formation epoch. Using the spectroscopically identified cluster members we
present the galaxy luminosity function for this fossil system. We measure the
velocity dispersion of the galaxies to be ~ 700 km/s based on 18 confirmed
members. The dynamical mass is nearly twice the total gravitational mass
derived from the X-ray analysis. The measured R-band mass-to-light ratio,
within the virial radius, is ~ 440 M/L (solar) which is not unusual for
clusters of galaxies. The central giant elliptical galaxy has discy isophotes
and spectral features typical of elliptical galaxies.",2006-03-22T15:08:03Z
Dufour and Soret effects in a magnetized and non-magnetized plasma,"It is well known that magnetic fields affect heat conduction in a different
way in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the field. In this paper a
formal derivation of this phenomenon and analytical expressions for the
transport coefficients based in the Boltzmann equation are presented. Moreover,
the Dufour effect or diffusion thermo effect is usually ignored in plasma
transport theory. In this work, analytic expressions for the parallel and
perpendicular thermal conductivities as well as the coefficients for both the
thermal diffusion, or Soret, effect and the Dufour effect are formally derived.
It is also shown how the heat conduction in the perpendicular direction
decreases with increasing magnetic field and how in both directions the
diffusion thermo effect is significant compared to thermal conduction. Other
aspects of this work are also emphasized.",2006-06-27T22:45:49Z
"Terrestrial planetary dynamics: a view from U, Th geochemistry","The migration of U and Th inside a planet is controlled by its oxidation
state imposed by the volatile composition. In the deep interior of a planet, an
absence of oxidative volatiles will cause U and Th to stay in a state of metal
or low valance compounds with a big density. Consequently, they migrate to the
bottom of its mantle first, and then are gradually sequestered to its liquid
metal core. Earth is rich in oxidative volatiles including water, therefore, U
and Th in the core can be moved up by an internal circulation system consisting
of the outer core, hot super plumes, asthenosphere and subduction zone (or cold
super plumes). This internal circulation system is the key for the formation of
plate tectonics, the geodynamo and the consequent geomagnetic field. Moreover,
plentiful oxidative volatiles and water within Earth is the precondition to
form such a circulation system. In the early stage (> 4 Ga), Mars developed an
Earth-like internal circulation system due to relatively large amount of
oxidative volatile compositions coming from its building material. This would
have produced a dynamo and correspondingly an Earth-like magnetic field.
However, this internal circulation system was destroyed by one or several giant
impact events in the early stage, which drove off these volatile compositions.
These events also shaped the striking hemispheric dichotomy structure on the
Martian surface. The other result is that its dynamo and geomagnetic field have
also disappeared. Since then, Mars has been the same as Mercury and Venus in
that the heat release from the U and Th in their cores can not be moved by an
internal circulation system gently, but by sporadically catastrophic
resurfacing events (Venus), or super plumes (Mars) or gradual heat conduction
(Mercury).",2006-06-20T05:29:00Z
Diffraction-Based Sensitivity Analysis of Apodized Pupil Mapping Systems,"Pupil mapping is a promising and unconventional new method for high contrast
imaging being considered for terrestrial exoplanet searches. It employs two (or
more) specially designed aspheric mirrors to create a high-contrast amplitude
profile across the telescope pupil that does not appreciably attenuate
amplitude. As such, it reaps significant benefits in light collecting
efficiency and inner working angle, both critical parameters for terrestrial
planet detection. While much has been published on various aspects of pupil
mapping systems, the problem of sensitivity to wavefront aberrations remains an
open question. In this paper, we present an efficient method for computing the
sensitivity of a pupil mapped system to Zernike aberrations. We then use this
method to study the sensitivity of a particular pupil mapping system and
compare it to the concentric-ring shaped pupil coronagraph. In particular, we
quantify how contrast and inner working angle degrade with increasing Zernike
order and rms amplitude. These results have obvious ramifications for the
stability requirements and overall design of a planet-finding observatory.",2006-05-25T04:26:54Z
Hypervelocity Stars. I. The Spectroscopic Survey,"We discuss our targeted search for hypervelocity stars (HVSs), stars
traveling with velocities so extreme that dynamical ejection from a massive
black hole is their only suggested origin. Our survey, now half complete, has
successfully identified a total of four probable HVSs plus a number of other
unusual objects. Here we report the most recently discovered two HVSs: SDSS
J110557.45+093439.5 and possibly SDSS J113312.12+010824, traveling with
Galactic rest-frame velocities at least +508+-12 and +418+-10 km/s,
respectively. The other late B-type objects in our survey are consistent with a
population of post main-sequence stars or blue stragglers in the Galactic halo,
with mean metallicity [Fe/H]=-1.3 and velocity dispersion 108+-5 km/s.
Interestingly, the velocity distribution shows a tail of objects with large
positive velocities that may be a mix of low-velocity HVSs and high-velocity
runaway stars. Our survey also includes a number of DA white dwarfs with
unusually red colors, possibly extremely low mass objects. Two of our objects
are B supergiants in the Leo A dwarf, providing the first spectroscopic
evidence for star formation in this dwarf galaxy within the last ~30 Myr.",2006-04-05T19:56:17Z
The high velocity outflow in NGC6334I,"We observed the high velocity outflow originating from NGC6334I in several CO
transitions with the APEX telescope, with the goal of deriving the physical
parameters of the gas. Using an LVG analysis, we studied line ratios between
the CO(3-2), CO(4-3), and CO(7-6) data as a function of the density and of the
kinetic temperature of the gas. An upper limit on the CO column density is
derived by comparison with 13CO data. We constrained the temperature to be
higher than 50 K and the H_2 density to values higher than n~10^4 cm^{-3}
towards the peak position in the red lobe, while T>15 K and n>10^3 cm^{-3} are
derived towards the peak position in the blue lobe. The physical parameters of
the outflow, its mass and its energetics, have been computed using the
temperatures derived from this analysis. We conclude that high kinetic
temperatures are present in the outflow and traced by high excitation CO lines.
Observations of high-J CO lines are thus needed to infer reliable values of the
kinetic temperatures and of the other physical parameters in outflows.",2006-05-30T09:00:34Z
"Modelling the Galactic Interstellar Extinction Distribution in Three
  Dimensions","The Two Micron All Sky Survey, along with the Stellar Population Synthesis
Model of the Galaxy, developed in Besancon, is used to calculate the extinction
distribution along different lines of sight. By combining many lines of sight,
the large scale distribution of interstellar material can be deduced. The
Galaxy model is used to provide the intrinsic colour of stars and their
probable distances, so that the near infrared colour excess, and hence the
extinction, may be calculated and its distance evaluated. Such a technique is
dependent on the model used, however we are able to show that moderate changes
in the model parameters result in insignificant changes in the predicted
extinction. This technique has now been applied to over 64000 lines of sight,
each separated by 15 arcmin, in the inner Galaxy (|l|<=100 deg, |b|<=10 deg).
Using our extinction map, we have derived the main characteristics of the large
scale structure of the dust distribution: scale height and warp of the ISM disc
as well as the angle of the dust in the Galactic Bar. This resulting extinction
map will be useful for studies of the inner Galaxy and its stellar populations.",2006-04-20T14:09:23Z
"Line-of-sight velocity dispersions and a mass distribution model of the
  Sa galaxy NGC 4594","In the present paper we develop an algorithm allowing to calculate
line-of-sight velocity dispersions in an axisymmetric galaxy outside of the
galactic plane. When constructing a self-consistent model, we take into account
the galactic surface brightness distribution, stellar rotation curve and
velocity dispersions. This algorithm is applied to a Sa galaxy NGC 4594 = M
104, for which there exist velocity dispersion measurements outside of the
galactic major axis. The mass distribution model is constructed in two stages.
In the first stage we construct a luminosity distribution model, where only
galactic surface brightness distribution is taken into account. Thereafter, in
the second stage we develop on the basis of the Jeans equations a detailed mass
distribution model and calculate line-of-sight velocity dispersions and the
stellar rotation curve. Here a dark matter halo is added to visible components.
Calculated dispersions are compared with observations along different slit
positions perpendicular and parallel to the galactic major axis. In the
best-fitting model velocity dispersion ellipsoids are radially elongated.
Outside the galactic plane velocity dispersion behaviour is more sensitive to
the dark matter density distribution and allows to estimate dark halo
parameters.",2006-06-28T10:19:08Z
"Differential Radial Velocities and Stellar Parameters of Nearby Young
  Stars","Radial velocity searches for substellar mass companions have focused
primarily on stars older than 1 Gyr. Increased levels of stellar activity in
young stars hinders the detection of solar system analogs and therefore there
has been a prejudice against inclusion of young stars in radial velocity
surveys until recently. Adaptive optics surveys of young stars have given us
insight into the multiplicity of young stars but only for massive, distant
companions. Understanding the limit of the radial velocity technique,
restricted to high-mass, close-orbiting planets and brown dwarfs, we began a
survey of young stars of various ages. While the number of stars needed to
carry out full analysis of the problems of planetary and brown dwarf population
and evolution is large, the beginning of such a sample is included here. We
report on 61 young stars ranging in age from beta Pic association (~12 Myr) to
the Ursa Majoris association (~300 Myr). This initial search resulted in no
stars showing evidence for companions greater than ~1-2 M_Jup in short period
orbits at the 3 sigma-level. Additionally, we present derived stellar
parameters, as most have unpublished values. The chemical homogeneity of a
cluster, and presumably of an association, may help to constrain true
membership. As such, we present [Fe/H] abundances for the stars in our sample.",2006-05-17T20:24:59Z
"Curious Variables Experiment (CURVE). Variable properties of the dwarf
  nova SS UMi","We report on extensive photometry of the dwarf nova SS Ursae Minoris
throughout nine months of 2004. In total, we recorded two superoutbursts and 11
normal outbursts of the star. SS UMi has been known to show frequent
superoutbursts with a mean interval of 84.7 days. Our data suggest that the
interval between successive superoutbursts lengthened to 197 days, indicating
that SS UMi entered a period of untypical behavior manifested by a growth in
the quiescent magnitude of the star and a series of frequent, low-amplitude,
normal outbursts observed from July to September 2004.
  The mean superhump period derived for the April 2004 superoutburst of SS UMi
is 0.070149(16) days (101.015 min). Combining this value with an earlier
orbital period determination, we were able to derive the period excess, which
is equal to 3.5 +/- 1.6%, and estimate the mass ratio of the binary system as
equal to q=0.16 +/- 0.07.
  During the entire superoutburst, the period decreased at a rate of $\dot
P/P_{\rm sh} = -6.3(1.4) \times 10^{-5}$. However, detailed analysis of the
timings of superhump maxima seem to suggest a more complex period change, with
a decrease in the period during the first and last stages of the superoutburst
but an increase in the middle interval.",2006-03-23T12:13:59Z
AGN Outflows in Emission and Absorption: The SDSS Perspective,"A variety of investigations have demonstrated commonalities between the
Baldwin (1977) Effect, the blueshifting of CIV emission lines (e.g., Gaskell
1982; Richards et al. 2002), and the L_UV-L_X relationship (e.g., Avni &
Tananbaum 1982; Strateva et al. 2005; Steffen et al. 2006); indeed all three of
these observational effects may be manifestations of the same underlying (but
still uncertain) physics. This commonality is of interest to investigations of
accretion disk winds (e.g., Murray et al. 1995; Proga et al. 2000) from active
galactic nuclei (AGN) as there is evidence that broad absorption line quasars
(BALQSOs) are drawn from a parent sample of quasars that exhibit larger than
average CIV blueshifts, weaker than average CIV emission line strengths, and
bluer than average (intrinsic) colors. The properties of the absorption troughs
appear to be dependent upon these parameters. Thus, it is suggested that not
all quasars will host bona-fide BAL troughs, but that all (broad emission line)
quasars host outflows of some type, the structure of which is strongly
dependent on the quasar's spectral energy distribution.",2006-03-30T17:15:16Z
Radio Constraints on Activity in Young Brown Dwarfs,"We report on searches for radio emission from three of the nearest known
young brown dwarfs using the Very Large Array. We have obtained sensitive upper
limits on 3.6cm emission from 2MASSW J1207334-393254, TWA~5B and SSSPM
J1102-3431, all of which are likely members of the $\sim$8-Myr-old TW Hydrae
association. We derive constraints on the magnetic field strength and the
number density of accelerated electrons, under the assumption that young brown
dwarf atmospheres are able to produce gyrosynchrotron emission, as seems to be
indicated in older brown dwarfs. For the young brown dwarf TWA~5B, the ratio of
its detected X-ray luminosity to the upper limit on radio luminosity places it
within the expected range for young stars and older, active stars. Thus, its
behavior is anomalous compared to older brown dwarfs, in which radio luminosity
is substantially enhanced over the expected relationship. Our observations
deepen the conundrum of magnetic activity in brown dwarfs, and suggest that a
factor other than age is more important for determining radio emission in cool
substellar objects.",2006-04-25T15:36:55Z
The effect of planetary migration on the corotation resonance,"The migration of a planet through a gaseous disc causes the locations of
their resonant interactions to drift and can alter the torques exerted between
the planet and the disc. We analyse the time-dependent dynamics of a
non-coorbital corotation resonance under these circumstances. The ratio of the
resonant torque in a steady state to the value given by Goldreich & Tremaine
(1979) depends essentially on two dimensionless quantities: a dimensionless
turbulent diffusion time-scale and a dimensionless radial drift speed. When the
drift speed is comparable to the libration speed and the viscosity is small,
the torque can become much larger than the unsaturated value in the absence of
migration, but is still proportional to the large-scale vortensity gradient in
the disc. Fluid that is trapped in the resonance and drifts with it acquires a
vortensity anomaly relative to its surroundings. If the anomaly is limited by
viscous diffusion in a steady state, the resulting torque is inversely
proportional to the viscosity, although a long time may be required to achieve
this state. A further, viscosity-independent, contribution to the torque comes
from fluid that streams through the resonant region. In other cases, torque
oscillations occur before the steady value is achieved. We discuss the
significance of these results for the evolution of eccentricity in
protoplanetary systems. We also describe the possible application of these
findings to the coorbital region and the concept of runaway (or type III)
migration. [Abridged]",2006-05-04T20:46:32Z
Coronal loop widths and pressure scale heights,"The scale heights of stratification and the widths of steady solar coronal
loops exhibit properties unexplained by standard theory: observed scale heights
are often much greater than static theory predicts, while the nearly-constant
widths of loop emission signatures defy theoretical expectations for large flux
tubes in stratified media. In this work we relate the cross-sectional profile
of a coronal flux tube to its density scale height in steady-state plasma flow
regimes. Steady flows may shorten or lengthen the scale height according to how
the tube cross-sectional area varies with arclength. In a near-potential corona
the flux tubes are expected to be sufficiently expansive in many active regions
for scale heights to be increased by steady flows. On the other hand, cases
where scale lengths are actually increased to observed sizes form a small part
of the solution space, close to regimes where density profiles reverse.
Therefore, although steady flows are the only steady process known to be
capable of extending scale heights significantly, they are not expected to be
not responsible for the majority of extended active region scale heights.",2006-07-03T16:40:08Z
On the Determination of N and O Abundances in Low Metallicity Systems,"We show that in order to minimize the uncertainties in the N and O abundances
of low mass, low metallicity (O/H less than or equal to solar/5) emission-line
galaxies, it is necessary to employ separate parameterizations for inferring
Te[N II] and Te[O II] from Te[O III]. In addition, we show that for the above
systems, the ionization correction factor (ICF) for obtaining N/O from N+/O+,
where the latter is derived from optical emission-line flux ratios, is < ICF >
= 1.08 +/- 0.09. These findings are based on state-of-the-art single-star H II
region simulations, employing our own modeled stellar spectra as input. Our
models offer the advantage of having matching stellar and nebular abundances.
In addition, they have O/H as low as solar/50 (lower than any past work), as
well as log(N/O) and log(C/O) fixed at characteristic values of -1.46 and -0.7,
respectively. The above results were used to re-derive N and O abundances for a
sample of 68 systems with 12 + log(O/H) less than or equal to 8.1, whose
de-reddened emission-line strengths were collected from the literature. The
analysis of the log(N/O) versus 12 + log(O/H) diagram of the above systems
shows the following: (1) the largest group of objects forms the well-known N/O
plateau with a value for the mean (and its statistical error) of -1.43
(+.0084/-.0085); (2) the objects are distributed within a range in log(N/O) of
-1.54 to -1.27 in Gaussian fashion around the mean with a standard deviation of
sigma = +.071 / -.084; and (3) a chi-square analysis suggests that only a small
amount of the observed scatter in log(N/O) is intrinsic.",2006-03-24T00:20:43Z
"Disparate MgII Absorption Statistics towards Quasars and Gamma-Ray
  Bursts : A Possible Explanation","We examine the recent report by Prochter et al. (2006) that gamma-ray burst
(GRB) sight lines have a much higher incidence of strong MgII absorption than
quasar sight lines. We propose that the discrepancy is due to the different
beam sizes of GRBs and quasars, and that the intervening MgII systems are
clumpy with the dense part of each cloudlet of a similar size as the quasars,
i.e. < 10^16 cm, but bigger than GRBs. We also discuss observational
predictions of our proposed model. Most notably, in some cases the intervening
MgII absorbers in GRB spectra should be seen varying, and quasars with smaller
sizes should show an increased rate of strong MgII absorbers. In fact, our
prediction of variable MgII lines in the GRB spectra has been now confirmed by
Hao et al. (2007), who observed intervening FeII and MgII lines at z=1.48 to be
strongly variable in the multi-epoch spectra of z=4.05 GRB060206.",2006-05-26T22:02:02Z
"Evidence for chromatic X-ray light-curve breaks in Swift GRB afterglows
  and their theoretical implications","The power-law decay of the X-ray emission of GRB afterglows 050319, 050401,
050607, 050713A, 050802 and 050922C exhibits a steepening at about 1--4 hours
after the burst which, surprisingly, is not accompanied by a break in the
optical emission. If it is assumed that both the optical and X-ray afterglows
arise from the same outflow then, in the framework of the standard forward
shock model, the chromaticity of the X-ray light-curve breaks indicates that
they do not arise solely from a mechanism related to the outflow dynamics (e.g.
energy injection) or the angular distribution of the blast-wave kinetic energy
(structured outflows or jets). The lack of a spectral evolution accompanying
the X-ray light-curve breaks shows that these breaks do not arise from the
passage of a spectral break (e.g. the cooling frequency) either. Under these
circumstances, the decoupling of the X-ray and optical decays requires that the
microphysical parameters for the electron and magnetic energies in the forward
shock evolve in time, whether the X-ray afterglow is synchrotron or
inverse-Compton emission. For a steady evolution of these parameters with the
Lorentz factor of the forward shock and an X-ray light-curve break arising from
cessation of energy injection into the blast-wave, the optical and X-ray
properties of the above six Swift afterglows require a circumburst medium with
a r^{-2} radial stratification, as expected for a massive star origin for long
GRBs. Alternatively, the chromatic X-ray light-curve breaks may indicate that
the optical and X-ray emissions arise from different outflows. Neither feature
(evolution of microphysical parameters or the different origin of the optical
and X-ray emissions) were clearly required by pre-Swift afterglows.",2006-04-05T17:54:51Z
"A WENO Algorithm for the Radiative Transfer and Ionized Sphere at
  Reionization","We show that the algorithm based on the weighted essentially nonoscillatory
(WENO) scheme with anti-diffusive flux corrections can be used as a solver of
the radiative transfer equations. This algorithm is highly stable and robust
for solving problems with both discontinuities and smooth solution structures.
We test this code with the ionized sphere around point sources. It shows that
the WENO scheme can reveal the discontinuity of the radiative or ionizing
fronts as well as the evolution of photon frequency spectrum with high accuracy
on coarse meshes and for a very wide parameter space. This method would be
useful to study the details of the ionized patch given by individual source in
the epoch of reionization. We demonstrate this method by calculating the
evolution of the ionized sphere around point sources in physical and frequency
spaces. It shows that the profile of the fraction of neutral hydrogen and the
ionized radius are sensitively dependent on the intensity of the source.",2006-04-12T07:18:07Z
"The Ages of Elliptical Galaxies from Infrared Spectral Energy
  Distributions","The mean ages of early-type galaxies obtained from the analysis of optical
spectra, give a mean age of 8 Gyr at z = 0, with 40% being younger than 6 Gyr.
Independent age determinations are possible by using infrared spectra (5-21
microns), which we have obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph on the Spitzer
Observatory. This age indicator is based on the collective mass loss rate of
stars, where mass loss from AGB stars produces a silicate emission feature at
9-12 microns. This feature decreases more rapidly than the shorter wavelength
continuum as a stellar population ages, providing an age indicator. From
observations of 30 nearby early-type galaxies, 29 show a spectral energy
distribution dominated by stars and one has significant emission from the ISM
and is excluded. The infrared age indicators for the 29 galaxies show them all
to be old, with a mean age of about 10 Gyr and a standard deviation of only a
few Gyr. This is consistent with the ages inferred from the values of M/L_B,
but is inconsistent with the ages derived from the optical line indices, which
can be much younger. All of these age indicators are luminosity-weighted and
should be correlated, even if multiple-age components are considered. The
inconsistency indicates that there is a significant problem with either the
infrared and the M/L_B ages, which agree, or with the ages inferred from the
optical absorption lines.",2006-04-19T03:12:07Z
"Tagging single muons and other long-flying relativistic charged
  particles by ultra-fast timing in air Cherenkov telescopes","Atmospheric air Cherenkov telescopes are successfully used for ground-based,
very high-energy (VHE) gamma ray astronomy. Triggers from the so-called single
muon and other long-flying relativistic charged particle events are an unwanted
background for the Cherenkov telescope. Because of low rate at TeV energies the
muon background is unimportant. It is much more intense for telescopes with
high photon sensitivity and low energy threshold. Below a few hundred GeV
energy, the so-called muon background becomes so intense, that it can
deteriorate the sensitivity of telescopes (the so-called muon-wall problem).
  From general considerations it can be anticipated that the signature of these
particles should be a light pulse with a narrow time structure. In fact,
simulations show that the pulses from muons have a very narrow time profile
that is well below the time resolutions of nearly all currently operating
telescopes. In this report we elaborate on the time profile of Cherenkov light
from the so-called single muons and show that a telescope with ultra-fast time
response can open a new dimension allowing one to tag and to reject those

"Opening a New Window to Fundamental Physics and Astrophysics: X-ray
  Polarimetry","An extensive theoretical literature predicts that X-ray Polarimetry can
directly determine relevant physical and geometrical parameters of
astrophysical sources, and discriminate between models further than allowed by
spectral and timing data only. X-ray Polarimetry can also provide tests of
Fundamental Physics. A high sensitivity polarimeter in the focal plane of a New
Generation X-ray telescope could open this new window in the High Energy Sky.",2006-03-15T16:13:32Z
Distances to Anomalous X-ray Pulsars using Red Clump Stars,"We identify `red clump stars' - core helium-burning giants - among 2MASS
stars and use them to measure the run of reddening with distance in the
direction of each of the Galactic Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXP). We combine
this with extinction estimates from X-ray spectroscopy to infer distances and
find that the locations of all AXP are consistent with being in Galactic spiral
arms. We also find that the 2-10 keV luminosities implied by our distances are
remarkably similar for all AXPs, being all around 1.3e35 erg s-1. Furthermore,
using our distances to estimate effective black-body emitting radii, we find
that the radii are tightly anti-correlated with pulsed fraction, and somewhat
less tightly anti-correlated with black-body temperature. We find no obvious
relationship of any property with the dipole magnetic field strength inferred
from the spin-down rate.",2006-06-01T14:29:44Z
"Observation of VHE Gamma Radiation from HESS J1834-087/W41 with the
  MAGIC Telescope","Recently, the HESS array has reported the detection of gamma-ray emission
above a few hundred GeV from eight new sources located close to the Galactic
Plane. The source HESS J1834-087 is spatially coincident with SNR G23.3-0.3
(W41). Here we present MAGIC observations of this source, resulting in the
detection of a differential gamma-ray flux consistent with a power law,
described as dN/(dA dt dE) = (3.7 +/- 0.6)*10^(-12) (E/TeV)^(-2.5 +/- 0.2) \
cm^(-2)s^(-1)TeV^(-1). We confirm the extended character of this flux. We
briefly discuss the observational technique used, the procedure implemented for
the data analysis, and put this detection in the perspective of the molecular
environment found in the region of W41. We present 13CO and 12CO emission maps
showing the existence of a massive molecular cloud in spatial superposition
with the MAGIC detection.",2006-04-10T09:52:57Z
Strong magnetic field in W75N OH maser flare,"A flare of OH maser emission was discovered in W75N in 2000. Its location was
determined with the VLBA to be within 110 au from one of the ultracompact H II
regions, VLA2. The flare consisted of several maser spots. Four of the spots
were found to form Zeeman pairs, all of them with a magnetic field strength of
about 40 mG. This is the highest ever magnetic field strength found in OH
masers, an order of magnitude higher than in typical OH masers. Three possible
sources for the enhanced magnetic field are discussed: (i) the magnetic field
of the exciting star dragged out by the stellar wind; (ii) the general
interstellar field in the gas compressed by the MHD shock; and (iii) the
magnetic field of planets which orbit the exciting star and produce maser
emission in gaseous envelopes.",2006-05-31T16:13:33Z
"Discovery of a cluster of galaxies behind the Milky Way: X-ray and
  optical observations","We report the discovery of Cl 2334+48, a rich cluster of galaxies in the Zone
of Avoidance, identified in public images from the XMM-Newton archive. We
present the main properties of this cluster using the XMM-Newton X-ray data,
along with new optical spectroscopic and photometric observations. Cl 2334+48
is located at z = 0.271 +/- 0.001, as derived from the optical spectrum of the
brightest member galaxy. Such redshift agrees with a determination from the
X-ray spectrum (z = 0.263 (+0.012/-0.010)), in which an intense emission line
is matched to the rest wavelength of the Fe Kalpha complex. Its intracluster
medium has a plasma temperature of 4.92 (+0.50/-0.48) keV, sub-solar abundance
(0.38 +/- 0.12 Zsun), and a bolometric luminosity of 3.2 x 10^44 erg/s. A
density contrast delta = 2500 is obtained in a radius of 0.5 Mpc/h70, and the
corresponding enclosed mass is 1.5 x 10^14 Msun. Optical images show an
enhancement of g'-i' > 2.5 galaxies around the central galaxy, as expected if
these were cluster members. The central object is a luminous E-type galaxy,
which is displaced ~ 40 kpc/h70 from the cluster X-ray center. In addition, it
has a neighbouring arc-like feature (~ 22"" or 90 kpc/h70 from it), probably due
to strong gravitational lensing. The discovery of Cl 2334+48 emphasises the
remarkable capability of the XMM-Newton to reveal new clusters of galaxies in
the Zone of Avoidance.",2006-06-15T18:22:34Z
"A sample of low-redshift BL Lacertae objects. II. EVN and MERLIN data
  and multi-wavelength analysis","We present new radio observations of 9 members of a sample of 29 nearby (z <
0.2) BL Lac objects. The new data have been obtained with the European VLBI
Network and/or the MERLIN at 1.6 and 5 GHz and complement previous
observations. For one object, the TeV source Mrk 421, we also present deep
multi-epoch VLBA and Global VLBI data, which reveal a resolved diffuse jet,
with clear signatures of limb brightening. We use the new and old data to
estimate physical parameters of the jets of the sample from which the subset
with new radio data is drawn. We derive Doppler factors in the parsec scale
radio jet in the range ~2 < delta < ~9. Using HST data, we separate the
contribution of the host galaxy from that of the active core. From the measured
and de-beamed observables, we find a weak correlation between radio power and
black hole mass, and a tight correlation between radio and optical core
luminosities. We interpret this result in terms of a common synchrotron origin,
with little contribution from a radiatively efficient accretion disk. The BL
Lacs in our sample have de-beamed properties similar to low power radio
galaxies, including the fundamental plane of black hole activity.",2006-04-10T23:01:40Z
X-ray Selected Intermediate-Redshift Groups of Galaxies,"We present spectroscopic confirmation of nine moderate redshift galaxy groups
and poor clusters selected from the ROSAT Deep Cluster Survey. The groups span
the redshift range z=0.23-0.59 and have between 4 and 20 confirmed members. The
velocity dispersions of these groups range from 125 to 650 km/s. Similar to
X-ray groups at low redshift, these systems contain a significant number of
early-type galaxies. Therefore, the trend for X-ray luminous groups to have
high early-type fractions is already in place by at least z=0.5. In 4 of the 9
groups, the X-ray emission is clearly peaked on the most luminous early-type
galaxy in the group. However, in several cases the central galaxy is composed
of multiple luminous nuclei, suggesting that the brightest group galaxy may
still be undergoing major mergers. In at least 3 of the groups in our sample, a
dominant early-type galaxy is not found at the center of the group potential.
This suggests that many of our groups are not dynamically evolved despite their
high X-ray luminosities. While similar systems have been identified at low
redshift, the X-ray luminosities of the intermediate redshift examples are one
to three orders of magnitude higher than those of their low redshift
counterparts. We suggest that this may be evidence for group downsizing: while
massive groups are still in the process of collapsing and virializing at
intermediate redshifts, only low-mass groups are in the process of forming at
the present day.",2006-06-02T20:47:15Z
Spectroscopy of Massive Stars,"Although rare, massive stars, being the main sources of ionizing radiation,
chemical enrichment and mechanical energy in the Galaxy, are the most important
objects of the stellar population. This review presents the many different
aspects of the main tool used to study these stars, i.e. spectroscopy. The
first part consists in an introduction on these objects and their physical
properties (mass, wind, evolution, relation with their environment). Next, the
spectral behaviour of single massive stars is investigated, in the visible as
well as in the X-ray domain. Finally, the last part of this paper deals with
massive binaries, especially those exhibiting a colliding wind phenomenon.",2006-04-27T15:20:15Z
"Terrestrial Consequences of Spectral and Temporal Variability in
  Ionizing Photon Events","Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) directed at Earth from within a few kpc may have
damaged the biosphere, primarily though changes in atmospheric chemistry which
admit greatly increased Solar UV. However, GRBs are highly variable in spectrum
and duration. Recent observations indicate that short (~0.1 s) burst GRBs,
which have harder spectra, may be sufficiently abundant at low redshift that
they may offer an additional significant effect. A much longer timescale is
associated with shock breakout luminosity observed in the soft X-ray (~10^3 s)
and UV (~10^5 s) emission, and radioactive decay gamma-ray line radiation
emitted during the light curve phase of supernovae (~10^7 s). Here we
generalize our atmospheric computations to include a broad range of peak photon
energies and investigate the effect of burst duration while holding total
fluence and other parameters constant. The results can be used to estimate the
probable impact of various kinds of ionizing events (such as short GRBs, X-ray
flashes, supernovae) upon the terrestrial atmosphere. We find that the ultimate
intensity of atmospheric effects varies only slightly with burst duration from
10^-1 s to 10^8 s. Therefore, the effect of many astrophysical events causing
atmospheric ionization can be approximated without including time development.
Detailed modeling requires specification of the season and latitude of the
event. Harder photon spectra produce greater atmospheric effects for spectra
with peaks up to about 20 MeV, because of greater penetration into the
stratosphere.",2006-04-26T23:04:45Z
"Removing the Microlensing Blending-Parallax Degeneracy Using Source
  Variability","Microlensing event MACHO 97-SMC-1 is one of the rare microlensing events for
which the source is a variable star, simply because most variable stars are
systematically eliminated from microlensing studies. Using observational data
for this event, we show that the intrinsic variability of a microlensed star is
a powerful tool to constrain the nature of the lens by breaking the degeneracy
between the microlens parallax and the blended light. We also present a
statistical test for discriminating the location of the lens based on the
\chi^2 contours of the vector \Lambda, the inverse of the projected velocity.
We find that while SMC self lensing is somewhat favored over halo lensing,
neither location can be ruled out with good confidence.",2006-04-07T17:12:09Z
Eridanus - A Supergroup in the Local Universe?,"We examine a possible supergroup in the direction of the Eridanus
constellation using 6dF Galaxy Survey second data release (6dFGS DR2) positions
and velocities together with 2MASS and HyperLEDA photometry. We perform a
friends-of-friends analysis to determine which galaxies are associated with
each substructure before examining the properties of the constituent galaxies.
The structure is made up of three individual groups that are likely to merge to
form a cluster of mass 7x10^13 Msolar. We conclude that this structure is a
supergroup. We also examine the colours, morphologies and luminosities of the
galaxies in the region with respect to their local projected surface density.
We find that the colours of the galaxies redden with increasing density, the
median luminosities are brighter with increasing environmental density and the
morphologies of the galaxies show a strong morphology-density relation. The
colours and luminosities of the galaxies in the supergroup are already similar
to those of galaxies in clusters, however the supergroup contains more
late-type galaxies, consistent with its lower projected surface density. Due to
the velocity dispersion of the groups in the supergroup, which are lower than
those of clusters, we conclude that the properties of the constituent galaxies
are likely to be a result of merging or strangulation processes in groups
outlying this structure.",2006-03-29T00:07:33Z
"Three-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations:
  Beam Profiles, Data Processing, Radiometer Characterization and Systematic
  Error Limits","The WMAP satellite has completed 3 years of observations of the cosmic
microwave background radiation. The 3-year data products include several sets
of full sky maps of the Stokes I, Q and U parameters in 5 frequency bands,
spanning 23 to 94 GHz, and supporting items, such as beam window functions and
noise covariance matrices. The processing used to produce the current sky maps
and supporting products represents a significant advancement over the first
year analysis, and is described herein. Improvements to the pointing
reconstruction, radiometer gain modeling, window function determination and
radiometer spectral noise parametrization are presented. A detailed description
of the updated data processing that produces maximum likelihood sky map
estimates is presented, along with the methods used to produce reduced
resolution maps and corresponding noise covariance matrices. Finally two
methods used to evaluate the noise of the full resolution sky maps are
presented along with several representative year-to-year null tests,
demonstrating that sky maps produced from data from different observational
epochs are consistent.",2006-03-17T19:44:11Z
"A Catalog of Broad Absorption Line Quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky
  Survey Third Data Release","We present a total of 4784 unique broad absorption line quasars from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey Third Data Release. An automated algorithm was used to
match a continuum to each quasar and to identify regions of flux at least 10%
below the continuum over a velocity range of at least 1000 km/s in the CIV and
MgII absorption regions. The model continuum was selected as the best-fit match
from a set of template quasar spectra binned in luminosity, emission line
width, and redshift, with the power-law spectral index and amount of dust
reddening as additional free parameters. We characterize our sample through the
traditional ``balnicity'' index and a revised absorption index, as well as
through parameters such as the width, outflow velocity, fractional depth and
number of troughs. From a sample of 16883 quasars at 1.7<z<4.38, we identify
4386 (26.0%) quasars with broad CIV absorption, of which 1756 (10.4%) satisfy
traditional selection criteria. From a sample of 34973 quasars at 0.5<z<2.15,
we identify 457 (1.31%) quasars with broad MgII absorption, 191 (0.55%) of
which satisfy traditional selection criteria. We also provide a supplementary
list of 39 visually identified z>4.38 quasars with broad CIV absorption. We
find that broad absorption line quasars may have broader emission lines on
average than other quasars.",2006-03-03T00:48:04Z
"Simultaneous X-ray and optical observations of S5 0716+714 after the
  outburst of March 2004","At the end of March 2004, the blazar S5 0716+714 underwent an optical
outburst that prompted for quasi-simultaneous target-of-opportunity
observations with the INTEGRAL and XMM-Newton satellites. In this paper, we
report the results of the XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL OMC data analysis. The X-ray
spectrum is well-represented by a concave broken power-law model, with the
break at about 2 keV. In the framework of the synchrotron self-Compton model,
the softer part of the spectrum, which is described by a power law of index
$\alpha \simeq 1.8$ ($f_\nu \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$), is probably due to
synchrotron emission, while the harder part of the spectrum, which has $\alpha
\simeq 1$, is due to inverse Compton emission. The blazar shows the long and
short-term variability typical of low-frequency peaked BL Lac (LBL): the former
is manifested by a gradual decrease in the optical flux from the peak as
observed by ground telescopes at the end of March 2004, while the latter is
characterized by soft X-ray and optical flares on time scales from a few
thousand seconds to few hours. We can follow spectral variations on sub-hour
time scales and study their correlation with the flux variability. We find
evidence that the peak energy of the time-resolved spectra is increasing with
flux. The modeling of the spectral energy distribution compared with archival
observations suggests that the long-term variability (from outburst to
quiescence or viceversa) could be due to a change in the injected power, while
the short-term variability (flares) could be explained with changes in the
slope of the distribution of the electrons.",2006-04-28T09:46:54Z
A Hot DQ White Dwarf in the Open Star Cluster M35,"We report the discovery of a hot DQ white dwarf, NGC 2168:LAWDS 28, that is a
likely member of the 150-Myr old cluster NGC 2168 (Messier 35). The spectrum of
the white dwarf is dominated by CII features. The effective temperature is
difficult to estimate but likely > 20,000 K based on the temperatures of hot
DQs with similar spectra. NGC2168:LAWDS 28 provides further evidence that hot
DQs may be the ``missing'' high-mass helium-atmosphere white dwarfs. Based on
published studies, we find that the DBA WD LP 475-242 is likely a member of the
Hyades open cluster, as often assumed. These two white dwarfs are the entire
sample of known He-atmosphere white dwarfs in open clusters with turnoff masses
>2 solar masses. Based on the number of known cluster DA white dwarfs and a
redetermination of the H-atmosphere:He-atmosphere ratio, commonly known as the
DA:DB ratio, we re-examine the hypothesis that the H- to He-atmosphere ratio in
open clusters is the same as the ratio in the field. Under this hypothesis, we
calculate that five He-atmosphere WDs are expected to have been discovered,
with a probability of finding fewer than three He-atmosphere white dwarfs of
0.08, or at the ~ 2-sigma level.",2006-04-20T00:15:49Z
"A new model for the Warm Absorber in NGC 3783: a single medium in total
  pressure equilibrium","(Abridged) Many active galactic nuclei exhibit X-ray features typical of the
highly ionized gas called ""Warm Absorber"" (WA). Such a material appears to be
stratified, displaying zones of different density, temperature, and ionization.
In this paper, we investigate the possibility of modelling the WA gas in NGC
3783 as a single medium in total pressure equilibrium, in contrast to the
current descriptions that are based on the presence of multiple regions, each
in constant density. The assumption of total pressure equilibrium yields a more
physical description of the WA, resulting in the natural stratification of the
ionized gas, and providing an explanation for the presence of lines from
different ionization states, as observed in WA spectra. We have used the
photoionization code TITAN to compute a grid of constant total pressure models
with the purpose of fitting the WA in NGC 3783. We have compared our models to
the 900 ks Chandra spectrum of NGC 3783 and to previous studies where the WA
was described by multiple zones of constant density. Our results show that the
WA features in NGC 3783 can be well reproduced by a clumpy, ionized gas with
cosmic abondances, ionization parameter = 2500 erg cm s^-1, column density = 4
10^22 cm^-2, and constant total pressure. We have shown that the WA in NGC3783
can be modelled by a single medium in total pressure equilibrium; this is
probably the case for other WAs currently described by multi-zone, constant
density models.",2006-03-23T15:44:42Z
Sub-milliarcsecond Imaging of SgrA* and M87,"We present and discuss new result from mm-VLBI observations of M87 and SgrA*,
using the Global mm-VLBI array (GMVA). New 3mm-VLBI images of the inner jet of
M87 are presented, showing details with a spatial resolution down to 15
Schwarzschild radii. This resolution corresponds to a similar spatial
resolution (in terms of R_s) obtained for Sgr A*. We discuss existing and new
size determinations for this source provided by mm-VLBI at wavelengths of 3, 2,
and 1.4 mm. With respect to the morphological difference between Sgr A* and M87
(the latter exhibits a long jet), a comparison of the sub-milliarcsecond
structures seen with mm-VLBI may lead to a better understanding of the
astro-physical processes acting in the vicinity of super-massive black holes.",2006-07-05T14:14:46Z
Status and Outlook of the EDELWEISS WIMP Search,"EDELWEISS is a direct dark matter search using cryogenic germanium

almost one kg of detectors in its final stage. EDELWEISS II recently started
commissioning runs. With an increased detection mass and better shielding, this
stage aims to gain two orders of magnitude in sensitivity and to serve as a
testbed for a larger, ton-scale experiment.",2006-05-19T13:56:05Z
"Stellar populations of early-type galaxies in different environments
  III. Line-strength gradients","We present line-strength gradients for 22 spectral indices measured in a
sample of 82 early-type galaxies in different environments,including the
high-density core of the Coma cluster, the Virgo cluster,poor groups,and field
galaxies. We derive age and metallicity gradients, and compare the mean values
with the predictions of different galaxy formation models. We explore the
behaviour of individual chemical species by deriving the metallicity gradient
with different indicators.We find that the strength of the metallicity gradient
inferred from stellar population models depends on the specific Lick index
employed. In particular, metallicity gradients obtained with CN2 and C4668
combined with Hb are steeper than when measured using Ca4227 or Fe4383. The
correlation of the metallicity gradients with other parameters also depends on
the specific index employed. If the metallicity gradient is obtained using CN2
and Mgb then it correlates with the central age of the galaxies. On the
contrary, if Fe4383 or Ca4227 are used, the metallicity gradient correlates
with the velocity dispersion gradient.This may suggests that several mechanism
have helped to set the age and metallicity gradients in early-type galaxies.
While we do not find any correlation between the metallicity gradient and the
central velocity dispersion for galaxies in low-density environments, we find a
marginal correlation between the metallicity gradient and the mass for galaxies
in the centre of the Coma cluster. We also find a trend for which galaxies in
denser environments show a steeper metallicity gradient than galaxies in less
dense environments.We interpret these results in light of the different models
to explain the differences between galaxies as a function of environment.",2006-04-27T14:49:43Z
A new sample of bright galaxy pairs in UZC,"We present a new sample of bright galaxy pairs extracted applying an
objective selection code to UZC catalog.The sample is volume limited to
M$_{zw}$ = -18.9 +5 log ${\it h}$ and contains 89 galaxy pairs.We analyze the
kinematical, morphological and photometrical properties of galaxies belonging
to this sample. We show that velocity separation, $| \Delta v_{r} |$, between
pair members is significantly lower in spiral type (S+S) pairs than in
early-type (E+E) and mixed (E+S) pairs.This indicates that truly isolated
galaxy pairs are more likely to be found among S+S pairs. We show that
ellipticals are rare and underluminous in B and that late spirals (T $\ge$ 4)
are overluminous. We confirm that the formation of bright ellipticals is a
phenomenon linked to group/cluster environment, while galaxy-galaxy interaction
may enhance blue luminosity of disk galaxies through SF phenomena. This last
statement is supported by the presence of strong FIR emission from early
spirals in this sample and by the high frequency of AGN/SB phenomenon, revealed
mainly in pairs of low relative radial velocity separation and showing signs of
interaction.",2006-05-05T09:02:52Z
"Measurement of non-axisymmetry in centres of advanced mergers of
  galaxies","We measure the non-axisymmetry in the luminosity distribution in the inner
few kpc of the remnants of advanced mergers of galaxies with a view to
understand the relaxation in the central regions. For this, we analyze the
images from the 2MASS archival data for a selected sample of 12 merging
galaxies, which show signs of interaction but have a single nucleus. The
central regions are fitted by elliptical isophotes whose centres are allowed to
vary to get the best fit. The centres of isophotes show a striking sloshing
pattern with a spatial variation of up to 20-30 % within the central 1 kpc.
This indicates mass asymmetry and a dynamically unrelaxed behaviour. Next, we
Fourier-analyze the galaxy images while keeping the centre constant and measure
the deviation from axisymmetry in terms of the fractional Fourier amplitudes
(A_1, A_2 etc) as a function of radius. All mergers show a high value of
lopsidedness (upto A_1 ~ 0.2) in the central 5 kpc. The m=2 asymmetry is even
stronger, with values of A_2 upto ~ 0.3, and in three cases these are shown to
represent bars. The corresponding values denoting non-axisymmetry in inner
regions of a control sample of eight non-merger galaxies are found to be
several times smaller. Surprisingly, this central asymmetry is seen even in
mergers where the outer regions have relaxed into a smooth elliptical-like
r^{1/4} profile or a spiral-like exponential profile. Thus the central
asymmetry is long-lived, estimated to be ~ 1 Gyr, and hence lasts for over 100
local dynamical timescales. These central asymmetries are expected to play a
key role in the future dynamical evolution of the central region of a merger,
and can help in feeding a central AGN.",2006-05-10T06:54:59Z
The ACS Virgo Cluster Survey. VIII. The Nuclei of Early-Type Galaxies,"(Abridged) The ACS Virgo Cluster Survey is an HST program to obtain
high-resolution, g and z-band images for 100 early-type members of the Virgo
Cluster, spanning a range of ~460 in blue luminosity. Based on this large,
homogeneous dataset, we present a sharp upward revision in the frequency of
nucleation in early-type galaxies brighter than M_B ~ -15 (66 < f_n < 82%), and
find no evidence for nucleated dwarfs to be more concentrated to the center of
Virgo than their non-nucleated counterparts. Resolved stellar nuclei are not
present in galaxies brighter than M_B ~ -20.5, however, there is no clear
evidence from the properties of the nuclei, or from the overall incidence of
nucleation, for a change at M_B ~ -17.6, the traditional dividing point between
dwarf and giant galaxies. On average, nuclei are ~3.5 mag brighter than a
typical globular cluster and have a median half-light radius ~4.2 pc. Nuclear
luminosities correlate with nuclear sizes and, in galaxies fainter than M_B ~
-17.6, nuclear colors. Comparing the nuclei to the ""nuclear clusters"" found in
late-type spiral galaxies reveals a close match in terms of size, luminosity
and overall frequency, pointing to a formation mechanism that is rather
insensitive to the detailed properties of the host galaxy. The mean
nuclear-to-galaxy luminosity ratio is indistinguishable from the mean
SBH-to-bulge mass ratio, calculated in early-type galaxies with detected
supermassive black holes (SBHs). We argue that compact stellar nuclei might be
the low-mass counterparts of the SBHs detected in the bright galaxies, and that
one should think in terms of ""Central Massive Objects"" -- either SBHs or
compact stellar nuclei -- that accompany the formation of almost all early-type
galaxies and contain a mean fraction ~0.3% of the total bulge mass.",2006-03-09T22:49:41Z
PTD vs. PO effects in power and polarisation of PLANCK HFI 100 beams,"A method of accelerated computation of broadband far off boresight patterns
of telescope beams is extended and applied to the 100 GHz channels of Planck
HFI (HFI 100). Far off boresight angle power patterns are computed with both
GRASP PTD and NUIM PO software, considering cuts with an angular size of 10
degrees. The former reveal secondary oscillations of radial power distribution
as compared with the latter. The difference for power patterns of a/b
polarisation channels is also investigated.",2006-06-06T16:50:36Z
"Spitzer Survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud, Surveying the Agents of a
  Galaxy's Evolution (SAGE) I: Overview and Initial Results","We are performing a uniform and unbiased, ~7x7 degrees imaging survey of the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), using the IRAC and MIPS instruments on board the
Spitzer Space Telescope in order to survey the agents of a galaxy's evolution
(SAGE), the interstellar medium (ISM) and stars in the LMC. The detection of
diffuse ISM with column densities >1.2x10^21 H cm^-2 permits detailed studies
of dust processes in the ISM. SAGE's point source sensitivity enables a
complete census of newly formed stars with masses >3 solar masses that will
determine the current star formation rate in the LMC. SAGE's detection of
evolved stars with mass loss rates >1x10^-8 solar masses per year will quantify
the rate at which evolved stars inject mass into the ISM of the LMC. The
observing strategy includes two epochs in 2005, separated by three months, that
both mitigate instrumental artifacts and constrain source variability. The SAGE
data are non-proprietary. The data processing includes IRAC and MIPS pipelines
and a database for mining the point source catalogs, which will be released to
the community in support of Spitzer proposal cycles 4 and 5. We present initial
results on the epoch 1 data with a special focus on the N79 and N83 region. The
SAGE epoch 1 point source catalog has ~4 million sources. The point source
counts are highest for the IRAC 3.6 microns band and decrease dramatically
towards longer wavelengths consistent with the fact that stars dominate the
point source catalogs and that the dusty objects, e.g. young stellar objects
and dusty evolved stars that detected at the longer wavelengths, are rare in
comparison. We outline a strategy for identifying foreground MW stars, that may
comprise as much as 18% of the source list, and background galaxies, that may
comprise ~12% of the source list.",2006-06-14T18:59:49Z
A comparative study of disc-planet interaction,"We perform numerical simulations of a disc-planet system using various
grid-based and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) codes. The tests are run
for a simple setup where Jupiter and Neptune mass planets on a circular orbit
open a gap in a protoplanetary disc during a few hundred orbital periods. We
compare the surface density contours, potential vorticity and smoothed radial
profiles at several times. The disc mass and gravitational torque time
evolution are analyzed with high temporal resolution. There is overall
consistency between the codes. The density profiles agree within about 5% for
the Eulerian simulations while the SPH results predict the correct shape of the
gap although have less resolution in the low density regions and weaker
planetary wakes. The disc masses after 200 orbital periods agree within 10%.
The spread is larger in the tidal torques acting on the planet which agree
within a factor 2 at the end of the simulation. In the Neptune case the
dispersion in the torques is greater than for Jupiter, possibly owing to the
contribution from the not completely cleared region close to the planet.",2006-05-09T15:55:09Z
The Universal Rotation Curve of Spiral Galaxies,"The observed strong dark-to-luminous matter coupling is described by a bias
relation between visible and dark matter sources. We discuss the bias which
emerges in the case where the topological structure of the Universe at very
large distances does not match properly that of the Friedman space. With the
use of such ""topological"" bias, we construct the Universal Rotation Curve (URC)
for spirals which occurs to be in a striking agreement with the empirically
known URC. We also show that the topological bias explains the origin of the
Tully-Fisher relation ($ L\sim V^{4}$) and predicts peculiar oscillations in
the URC with a characteristic length $\sim \sqrt{L}$.",2006-04-24T17:14:50Z
"Integrated specific star formation rates of galaxies, groups, and
  clusters: A continuous upper limit with stellar mass?","Aims: We investigate the build-up of stellar mass through star formation in
field galaxies, galaxy groups, and clusters in order to better understand the
physical processes regulating star formation in different haloes.
  Methods: In order to do so we relate ongoing star formation activity to the
stellar mass by studying the integrated specific star formation rate (SSFR),
defined as the star-formation rate per unit stellar mass, as a function of
integrated stellar mass for samples of field galaxies, groups of galaxies, and
galaxy clusters at 0.18 < z < 0.85. The star formation rate (SFR) is derived
from the ultraviolet continuum for the galaxies and group members, and from
emission line fluxes for the cluster galaxies. The stellar masses are computed
from multi-band photometry including the near-infrared bands for the galaxies
and groups, and from the dynamical mass for the cluster sample.
  Results: For the first time, integrated SSFRs for clusters and groups are
presented and related to the SSFRs of field galaxies. Tentatively, we find a
continuous upper limit for galaxies, groups, and clusters in the SSFR-stellar
mass plane over seven orders of magnitude in stellar mass. This might indicate
that the physical processes which control star formation in dark matter haloes
of different mass have the same scaling with mass over a wide range of masses
from dwarf galaxies to massive clusters of galaxies.",2006-03-23T09:55:42Z
"Can Galactic Cosmic Rays Account for Solar 6Li Without Overproducing
  Gamma Rays?","Cosmic-ray interactions with interstellar gas produces both 6Li, which
accumulates in the interstellar medium (ISM), and $\pi^0$ mesons, which decay
to gamma-rays which propagate throughout the cosmos. Local 6Li abundances and
extragalactic gamma-rays thus have a common origin which tightly links them. We
exploit this connection to use gamma-ray observations to infer the contribution
to 6Li nucleosynthesis by standard Galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) interactions with
the ISM. Our calculation uses a carefully propagated cosmic-ray spectrum and
accounts for 6Li production from both fusion reactions ($\alpha \alpha \to
^6Li$) as well as from spallation channels (${p,\alpha+CNO \to ^6Li$). We find
that although extreme assumptions yield a consistent picture, more realistic
ones indicate that solar 6Li cannot be produced by standard GCRs alone without
overproducing the hadronic gamma rays. Implications for the primordial 6Li
production by decaying dark matter and cosmic rays from cosmological structure
formation are discussed. Upcoming gamma-ray observations by GLAST will be
crucial for determining the resolution of this problem.",2006-05-26T20:01:04Z
"The AGN Outflow in the HDFS Target QSO J2233-606 from a High-Resolution
  VLT/UVES Spectrum","We present a detailed analysis of the intrinsic UV absorption in the central
HDFS target QSO J2233-606, based on a high-resolution, high S/N (~25 -- 50)
spectrum obtained with VLT/UVES. This spectrum samples the cluster of intrinsic
absorption systems outflowing from the AGN at radial velocities v ~ -5000 --
-3800 km/s in the key far-UV diagnostic lines - the lithium-like CNO doublets
and H I Lyman series. We fit the absorption troughs using a global model of all
detected lines to solve for the independent velocity-dependent covering factors
of the continuum and emission-line sources and ionic column densities. This
reveals increasing covering factors in components with greater outflow
velocity. Narrow substructure is revealed in the optical depth profiles,
suggesting the relatively broad absorption is comprised of a series of multiple
components. We perform velocity-dependent photoionization modeling, which
allows a full solution to the C, N, and O abundances, as well as the velocity
resolved ionization parameter and total column density. The absorbers are found
to have supersolar abundances, with [C/H] and [O/H] ~0.5 -- 0.9, and [N/H] ~
1.1 -- 1.3, consistent with enhanced nitrogen production expected from
secondary nucleosynthesis processes. Independent fits to each kinematic
component give consistent results for the abundances. The lowest-ionization
material in each of the strong absorbers is modeled with similar ionization
parameters. Components of higher-ionization (indicated by stronger O VI
relative to C IV and N V) are present at velocities just redward of each
low-ionization absorber. We explore the implications of these results for the
kinematic-geometric-ionization structure of the outflow.",2006-04-17T18:18:41Z
Instruments without optics: an integrated photonic spectrograph,"In recent years, a great deal of emphasis has been placed on achieving the
diffraction limit with large aperture telescopes. For a well matched
focal-plane instrument, the diffraction limit provides the highest possible
angular resolution and sensitivity per pixel. But it offers another key
advantage as we now show. Conventionally, as the telescope aperture D grows,
the instrument size grows in proportion to D, and cost increases as D^2 or
faster. However, an instrument that operates at the diffraction limit can break
the trend of spiralling costs. In traditional instruments, the light must pass
through a succession of large lenses, mirrors and gratings, making it difficult
to conserve the integrity of such as small psf. An alternative approach, as we
now show, is to couple the diffraction limited beam directly into an integrated
photonic spectrograph operating in low-order modes.",2006-06-13T02:04:10Z
Hierarchical Star Formation in the Spiral Galaxy NGC 628,"The distributions of size and luminosity for star-forming regions in the
nearby spiral galaxy NGC 628 are studied over a wide range of scales using
progressively blurred versions of an image from the Hubble Space Telescope
Advanced Camera for Surveys. Four optical filters are considered for the
central region, including Halpha. Two filters are used for an outer region. The
features in each blurred image are counted and measured using SExtractor. The
cumulative size distribution is found to be a power law in all passbands with a
slope of about -1.5 over 1.8 orders of magnitudes. The luminosity distribution
is approximately a power law too, with a slope of about -1 for logarithmic
intervals of luminosity. The results suggest a scale-free nature for stellar
aggregates in a galaxy disk. Fractal models of thin disks reproduce the
projected size distribution and suggest a projected mass distribution slope of
about -0.5 for these extended regions. This mass slope converts to the observed
luminosity slope if we account for luminosity evolution and longer lifetimes in
larger regions.",2006-05-20T01:12:52Z
Dwarf Galaxies of the Local Group,"XMM-Newton and Chandra have ushered in a new era for the study of dwarf
galaxies in the Local Group. We provide an overview of the opportunities,
challenges, and some early results. The large number of background sources
relative to galaxy sources is a major theme. Despite this challenge, the
identification of counterparts has been possible, providing hints that the same
mechanisms producing X-ray sources in larger galaxies are active in dwarf
galaxies. A supersoft X-ray source within 2"" of the supermassive black hole in
M32 may be a remnant of the tidal disruption of a giant, although other
explanations cannot be ruled out.",2006-06-14T20:50:45Z
"Time-Dependent Stochastic Particle Acceleration in Astrophysical
  Plasmas: Exact Solutions Including Momentum-Dependent Escape","Stochastic acceleration of charged particles due to interactions with
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) plasma waves is the dominant process leading to the
formation of the high-energy electron and ion distributions in a variety of
astrophysical systems. Collisions with the waves influence both the
energization and the spatial transport of the particles, and therefore it is
important to treat these two aspects of the problem in a self-consistent
manner. We solve the representative Fokker-Planck equation to obtain a new,
closed-form solution for the time-dependent Green's function describing the
acceleration and escape of relativistic ions interacting with Alfven or
fast-mode waves characterized by momentum diffusion coefficient $D(p)\propto
p^q$ and mean particle escape timescale $t_esc(p) \propto p^{q-2}$, where $p$
is the particle momentum and $q$ is the power-law index of the MHD wave
spectrum. In particular, we obtain solutions for the momentum distribution of
the ions in the plasma and also for the momentum distribution of the escaping
particles, which may form an energetic outflow. The general features of the
solutions are illustrated via examples based on either a Kolmogorov or
Kraichnan wave spectrum. The new expressions complement the results obtained by
Park and Petrosian, who presented exact solutions for the hard-sphere
scattering case ($q=2$) in addition to other scenarios in which the escape
timescale has a power-law dependence on the momentum. Our results have direct
relevance for models of high-energy radiation and cosmic-ray production in
astrophysical environments such as $\gamma$-ray bursts, active galaxies, and
magnetized coronae around black holes.",2006-04-24T21:07:06Z
The Virial Mass Function of Nearby SDSS Galaxy Clusters,"We present a new determination of the cluster mass function and velocity
dispersion function in a volume $\sim10^7 h^3$Mpc$^{-3}$ using the Fourth Data
Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We use the caustic technique to
remove foreground and background galaxies. The cluster virial mass function
agrees well with recent estimates from both X-ray observations and cluster
richnesses. The mass function lies between those predicted by the First-Year
and Three-Year WMAP data. We constrain the cosmological parameters $\Omega_m$
and $\sigma_8$ and find good agreement with WMAP and constraints from other
techniques. With the CIRS mass function alone, we estimate
$\Omega_m=0.24^{+0.14}_{-0.09}$ and $\sigma_8=0.92^{+0.24}_{-0.19}$, or
$\sigma_8=0.84\pm$0.03 when holding $\Omega_m=0.3$ fixed. We also use the WMAP
parameters as priors and constrain velocity segregation in clusters. Using the
First and Third-Year results, we infer velocity segregation of
$\sigma_{gxy}/\sigma_{DM}\approx0.94\pm$0.05 or 1.28$\pm$0.06 respectively. We
compare the velocity dispersion function of clusters to that of early-type
galaxies and conclude that clusters comprise the high-velocity end of the
velocity dispersion function of dark matter haloes. The evolution of cluster
abundances provides constraints on dark energy models; the mass function
presented here offers an important low redshift calibration benchmark.",2006-06-22T17:46:10Z
The Disk and Extraplanar Environment of NGC 247,"The stellar content of the spiral galaxy NGC 247 is investigated. The main
sequence turn-off (MSTO) in the inner 12 kpc of the disk corresponds to an age
of 6 Myr. A mean star formation rate (SFR) of 0.1 solar masses per year during
the past 16 Myr is computed from star counts. The color of the red supergiant
plume does not change with radius, suggesting that the mean metallicity of
young stars does not vary by more than 0.1 dex. The number of bright main
sequence stars per local stellar mass density climbs towards larger radii out
to a distance of 12 kpc; the scale lengths that characterize the radial
distributions of young and old stars in the disk thus differ. The density of
bright main sequence stars with respect to projected HI mass gradually drops
with increasing radius. The population of very young stars disappears in the
outer disk; the MSTO at galactocentric radii between 12 and 15 kpc corresponds
to 16 Myr, while between 15 and 18 kpc the age is > 40 Myr. Red giant branch
(RGB) stars are resolved at a projected minor axis galactocentric distance of
12 kpc. There is a broad spread in metallicity among the RGB stars, with a mean
[M/H] = -1.2. The RGB-tip occurs at i' = 24.5 +/- 0.1, indicating that the
distance modulus is 27.9 +/- 0.1. Luminous AGB stars with an age 3 Gyr are also
seen in this field.",2006-03-14T00:08:56Z
"Contour binning: a new technique for spatially-resolved X-ray
  spectroscopy applied to Cassiopeia A","We present a new technique for choosing spatial regions for X-ray
spectroscopy, called ""contour binning"". The method chooses regions by following
contours on a smoothed image of the object. In addition we re-explore a simple
method for adaptively smoothing X-ray images according to the local count rate,
we term ""accumulative smoothing"", which is a generalisation of the method used
by FADAPT. The algorithms are tested by applying them to a simulated cluster
data set. We illustrate the techniques by using them on a 50 ks Chandra
observation of the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant. Generated maps of the object
showing abundances in eight different elements, absorbing column density,
temperature, ionisation timescale and velocity are presented. Tests show that
contour binning reproduces surface brightness considerably better than other
methods. It is particularly suited to objects with detailed spatial structure
such as supernova remnants and the cores of galaxy clusters, producing
aesthetically pleasing results.",2006-06-21T17:31:59Z
"3D photoionisation and dust RT modelling with MOCASSIN: geometry effects
  on the emission line spectra of star-forming regions","Emission line spectra from HII regions are often used to study properties of
the gas in star-forming regions, as well as temperatures and luminosities of
the ionising sources. Empirical diagnostics for the interpretation of
observational data must often be calibrated with the aid of photoionisation
models. Most studies so far have been carried out by assuming spherical or
plane-parallel geometries, with major limitations on allowed gas and dust
density distributions and with the spatial distribution of multiple,
non-centrally-located ionising sources not being accounted for. We present the
first results of our theoretical study of geometric effects, via the
construction of a number of 3D photoionisation models using the MOCASSIN code
for a variety of spatial configurations and ionisation sources. We compare
integrated emission line spectra from such configurations and show evidence of
systematic errors caused by the simplifying assumption of a single, central
location for all ionising sources.",2006-06-07T17:12:05Z
The Initial Mass Function of Stars,"Observations and theory of the IMF are briefly reviewed. Slight variations
have been observed, although they are difficult to prove unambiguously. Most
detailed theoretical models reproduce the IMF, but because they use different

"The Distances to Open Clusters from Main-Sequence Fitting. III. Improved
  Accuracy with Empirically Calibrated Isochrones","We continue our series of papers on open cluster distances with a critical
assessment of the accuracy of main-sequence fitting using isochrones that
employ empirical corrections to the color-temperature relations. We use four
nearby open clusters with multicolor photometry and accurate metallicities and
present a new metallicity for Praesepe ([Fe/H] = +0.11 +/- 0.03) from
high-resolution spectra. The internal precision of distance estimates is about
a factor of 5 better than the case without the color calibrations. After taking
into account all major systematic errors, we obtain distances accurate to about
2%-3% when there exists a good metallicity estimate. Metallicities accurate to
better than 0.1 dex may be obtained from BVIcKs photometry alone. We also
derive a helium abundance for the Pleiades of Y = 0.279 +/- 0.015, which is
equal within the errors to the Sun's initial helium abundance and that of the
Hyades. Our best estimates of distances are (m - M)_0 = 6.33 +/- 0.04, 8.03 +/-
0.04, and 9.61 +/- 0.03 to Praesepe, NGC 2516, and M67, respectively. Our
Pleiades distance at the spectroscopic metallicity, (m - M)_0 = 5.66 +/- 0.01
(internal) +/- 0.05 (systematic), is in excellent agreement with several
geometric distance measurements. We have made calibrated isochrones for -0.3 <=
[Fe/H] <= +0.2 available at http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/iso/ .",2006-07-24T20:32:25Z
Evidence for precession of the isolated neutron star RX J0720.4-3125,"The XMM-Newton spectra of the isolated neutron star RX J0720.4-3125 obtained
over 4.5 years can be described by sinusoidal variations in the inferred
blackbody temperature, the size of the emitting area and the depth of the
absorption line with a period of 7.1 +/- 0.5 years, which we suggest to be the
precession period of the neutron star. Precession of a neutron star with two
hot spots of different temperature and size, probably not located exactly in
antipodal positions, may account for the variations in the X-ray spectra,
changes in the pulsed fraction, shape of the light curve and the phase-lag
between soft and hard energy bands observed from RX J0720.4-3125. An
independent sinusoidal fit to published and new pulse timing residuals from a
coherent analysis covering ~12 years yields a consistent period of 7.7 +/- 0.6
years supporting the precession model.",2006-03-27T15:04:09Z
"Refining a relativistic, hydrodynamic solver: Admitting
  ultra-relativistic flows","We have undertaken the simulation of hydrodynamic flows with bulk Lorentz
factors in the range 10^2--10^6. We discuss the application of an existing
relativistic, hydrodynamic primitive-variable recovery algorithm to a study of
pulsar winds, and, in particular, the refinement made to admit such
ultra-relativistic flows. We show that an iterative quartic root finder breaks
down for Lorentz factors above 10^2 and employ an analytic root finder as a
solution. We find that the former, which is known to be robust for Lorentz
factors up to at least 50, offers a 24% speed advantage. We demonstrate the
existence of a simple diagnostic allowing for a hybrid primitives recovery
algorithm that includes an automatic, real-time toggle between the iterative
and analytical methods. We further determine the accuracy of the iterative and
hybrid algorithms for a comprehensive selection of input parameters and
demonstrate the latter's capability to elucidate the internal structure of
ultra-relativistic plasmas. In particular, we discuss simulations showing that
the interaction of a light, ultra-relativistic pulsar wind with a slow, dense
ambient medium can give rise to asymmetry reminiscent of the Guitar nebula
leading to the formation of a relativistic backflow harboring a series of
internal shockwaves. The shockwaves provide thermalized energy that is
available for the continued inflation of the PWN bubble. In turn, the bubble
enhances the asymmetry, thereby providing positive feedback to the backflow.",2006-05-31T22:12:38Z
Solar System Binaries,"The discovery of binaries in each of the major populations of minor bodies in
the solar system is propelling a rapid growth of heretofore unattainable
physical information. The availability of mass and density constraints for
minor bodies opens the door to studies of internal structure, comparisons with
meteorite samples, and correlations between bulk- physical and surface-spectral
properties. The number of known binaries is now more than 70 and is growing
rapidly. The relative sizes and separations of binaries in the different minor
body populations point to more than one mechanism for forming bound pairs.
Collisions appear to play a major role in the Main Belt. Rotational and/or
tidal fission may be important in the Near Earth population. For the Kuiper
Belt, capture in multi-body interactions may be the preferred formation
mechanism. High angular resolution observations from space and from the ground
are critical for detection of the relatively distant binaries in the Main Belt
and the Kuiper Belt. Radar has been the most productive method for detection of
Near Earth binaries. Lightcurve analysis is an independent technique that is
capable of exploring phase space inaccessible to direct observations. Finally,
spacecraft flybys have played a crucial paradigm-changing role with discoveries
that unlocked this now-burgeoning field.",2006-03-06T15:09:43Z
Neutrino masses and cosmic radiation density: Combined analysis,"We determine the range of neutrino masses and cosmic radiation content
allowed by the most recent CMB and large-scale structure data. In contrast to
other recent works, we vary these parameters simultaneously and provide
likelihood contours in the two-dimensional parameter space of N_eff}, the usual
effective number of neutrino species measuring the radiation density, and \sum
m_nu. The allowed range of \sum m_nu and N_eff has shrunk significantly
compared to previous studies. The previous degeneracy between these parameters
has disappeared, largely thanks to the baryon acoustic oscillation data. The
likelihood contours differ significantly if \sum m_nu resides in a single
species instead of the standard case of being equally distributed among all
flavors. For \sum m_nu=0 we find 2.7 < N_eff < 4.6 at 95% CL while \sum m_nu <
0.62 eV at 95% CL for the standard radiation content.",2006-07-06T10:15:27Z
One-dimensional Hybrid Approach to Extensive Air Shower Simulation,"An efficient scheme for one-dimensional extensive air shower simulation and
its implementation in the program CONEX are presented. Explicit Monte Carlo
simulation of the high-energy part of hadronic and electromagnetic cascades in
the atmosphere is combined with a numeric solution of cascade equations for
smaller energy sub-showers to obtain accurate shower predictions. The developed
scheme allows us to calculate not only observables related to the number of
particles (shower size) but also ionization energy deposit profiles which are
needed for the interpretation of data of experiments employing the fluorescence
light technique. We discuss in detail the basic algorithms developed and
illustrate the power of the method. It is shown that Monte Carlo, numerical,
and hybrid air shower calculations give consistent results which agree very
well with those obtained within the CORSIKA program.",2006-06-22T18:29:32Z
The Swift X-ray flaring afterglow of GRB 050607,"The unique capability of the Swift satellite to perform a prompt and
autonomous slew to a newly detected Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) has yielded the
discovery of interesting new properties of GRB X-ray afterglows, such as the
steep early lightcurve decay and the frequent presence of flares detected up to
a few hours after the GRB trigger. We present observations of GRB 050607, the
fourth case of a GRB discovered by Swift with flares superimposed on the
overall fading X-ray afterglow. The flares of GRB 050607 were not symmetric as
in previously reported cases, showing a very steep rise and a shallower decay,
similar to the Fast Rise, Exponential Decay that are frequently observed in the
gamma-ray prompt emission. The brighter flare had a flux increase by a factor
of approximately 25,peaking for 30 seconds at a count rate of approximately 30
counts s-1, and it presented hints of addition short time scale activity during
the decay phase. There is evidence of spectral evolution during the flares. In
particular, at the onset of the flares the observed emission was harder, with a
gradual softening as each flare decayed. The very short time scale and the
spectral variability during the flaring activity are indicators of possible
extended periods of energy emission by the GRB central engine. The flares were
followed by a phase of shallow decay, during which the forward shock was being
refreshed by a long-lived central engine or by shells of lower Lorentz factors,
and by a steepening after approximately 12 ks to a decay slope considered
typical of X-ray afterglows.",2006-03-24T01:29:06Z
"Is there a caustic crossing in the lensed quasar Q2237+0305
  observational data record?","We re-investigate the gravitationally lensed system Q2237+0305 data record to
quantify the probability of having a caustic crossing in the A component.
Several works assume that this is the case, but no quantitative analysis is
available in the literature. We combine the datasets from the OGLE and GLITP
collaborations to accurately trace the prominent event in the lightcurve for
the A component of the system. Then the observed event is compared with
synthetic light curves derived from trajectories in magnification maps. These
maps are generated using a ray-tracing technique. We take more than 10^9
trajectories and test a wide range of different physical properties of the
lensing galaxy and the source quasar (lens transverse velocity, microlens mass,
source intensity profile and source size). We found that around 75% of our good
trajectories (i.e. that are consistent with the observations) are caustic
crossings. In addition, a high transverse velocity exceeding 300 km/s, a
microlens mass of about 0.1 M_sun and a small standard accretion disk is the
best parameter combination. The results justify the interpretation of the
OGLE-GLITP event in Q2237+0305A as a caustic crossing. Moreover, the physical
properties of the lens and source are in very good agreement with previous
works. We also remark that a standard accretion disk is prefered to those
simpler approaches, and that the former should be used in subsequent
simulations.",2006-07-08T17:00:04Z
Power-laws and Non-Power-laws in Dark Matter Halos,"Simulated dark matter profiles are often modelled as a `NFW' density profile
rather than a single power law. Recently, attention has turned to the rather
rigorous power-law behaviour exhibited by the `pseudo phase-space density' of
the dark matter halo, which is defined dimensionally in terms of the local
density and velocity dispersion of the dark matter particles. The non-power-law
behaviour of the density profile is generally taken to exclude simple
scale-free, in-fall models; however the power-law behaviour of the
`pseudo-density' is a counter indication. We argue in this paper that both
behaviours may be at least qualitatively understood in terms of a dynamically
evolving self-similarity, rather than the form for self-similar infall that is
fixed by cosmological initial conditions. The evolution is likely due to
collective relaxation such as that provided by the radial-orbit instability on
large scales. We deduce, from a distribution function given by first order
coarse-graining, both the NFW-type density profile and the power-law
pseudo-density profile. The results are not greatly sensitive to variation
about 3 in the power of the velocity dispersion used in the definition of the
phase space pseudo-density. We suggest that the power 2 may create the more
physical quantity, whose deviations from a power-law are a diagnostic of
incomplete relaxation.",2006-06-27T12:54:26Z
"Cosmological Simulations of Intergalactic Medium Enrichment from
  Galactic Outflows","We investigate models of self-consistent chemical enrichment of the
intergalactic medium (IGM) from z=6 to 1.5, based on hydrodynamic simulations
of structure formation that incorporate galactic outflows. Our main result is
that outflow parameterizations based on momentum-driven winds as seen in local
starburst galaxies provide the best agreement with observations of CIV
absorption at z~2-5. Such models sufficiently enrich the high-z IGM to produce
a global mass density of CIV absorbers that is relatively invariant from z=5.5
to 1.5, in agreement with observations. This occurs despite an increase in the
volume-averaged metallicity by x5-10 over this redshift range, because energy
input from outflows causes a drop in the global ionization fraction of CIV.
Comparisons to observed CIV column density and linewidth distributions and
CIV-based pixel optical depth ratios provide significant constraints on wind
models. Our best-fitting models show mean IGM temperatures only slightly above
our no-outflow case, metal filling factors of just a few % with volume-weighted
metallicities around 0.001 at z~3, significant amounts of collisionally-ionized
CIV absorption, and a metallicity-density relationship that rises rapidly at
low overdensities and flattens at higher ones. In general, we find that outflow
speeds must be high enough to enrich the low-density IGM at early times but low
enough not to overheat it, and concurrently must significantly suppress early
star formation while still producing enough early metals. It is therefore
non-trivial that locally-calibrated momentum-driven wind scenarios naturally
yield the desired strength and evolution of outflows, and suggest that such
models represent a significant step towards understanding the impact of
galactic outflows on galaxies and the IGM across cosmic time.",2006-05-25T19:44:35Z
New constrains on Gliese 86 B,"We present the results of multi epochs imaging observations of the companion
to the planetary host Gliese 86. Associated to radial velocity measurements,
this study aimed at characterizing dynamically the orbital properties and the
mass of this companion (here after Gliese 86 B), but also at investigating the
possible history of this particular system. We used the adaptive optics
instrument NACO at the ESO Very Large Telescope to obtain deep coronographic
imaging in order to determine new photometric and astrometric measurements of
Gliese 86 B. Part of the orbit is resolved. The photometry of Gliese B
indicates colors compatible with a ~70 Jupiter mass brown dwarf or a white
dwarf. Both types of objects allow to fit the available, still limited
astrometric data. Besides, if we attribute the long term radial velocity
residual drift observed for Gliese A to B, then the mass of the latter object
is ~0.5 Msun. We analyse both astrometric and radial velocity data to propose
first orbital parameters for Gliese B. Assuming Gliese B is a ~0.5 Msun white
dwarf, we explore the constraints induced by this hypothesis and refine the
parameters of the system.",2006-06-07T19:44:56Z
Refined parameters of the planet orbiting HD 189733,"We report on the BVRI multi-band follow-up photometry of the transiting
extrasolar planet HD 189733b. We revise the transit parameters and find
planetary radius RP = 1.154+/- 0.032RJ and inclination i_P = 85.79+/-0.24deg.
The new density (~ 1g cm-3) is significantly higher than the former estimate (~
0.75g cm-3); this shows that from the current sample of 9 transiting planets,
only HD 209458 (and possibly OGLE-10b) have anomalously large radii and low
densities. We note that due to the proximity of the parent star, HD 189733b
currently has one of the most precise radius determinations among extrasolar
planets. We calculate new ephemerides: P = 2.218573+/-0.000020 days, T0 =
2453629.39420+/-0.00024 (HJD), and estimate the timing offsets of the 11
distinct transits with respect to the predictions of a constant orbital period,
which can be used to reveal the presence of additional planets in the system.",2006-03-12T22:36:03Z
Mapping the ionizing sources with CMB polarization measurements,"We show that the delay of structure formation from WMAP3 can not fully
account for the reduction of electron optical depth from WMAP1 to WMAP3 when
the radiative transfer effects and feedback mechanisms are took into account in
computing the reionization history of the Universe. As the ultimate limit in
constraining the reionizatin history of the Universe with Planck will be placed
by the our understanding of systematic effects and foregrounds removal, we
discuss also these aspects.",2006-05-20T10:28:57Z
Intrinsic Brightness Temperatures of AGN Jets,"We present a new method for studying the intrinsic brightness temperatures of
the parsec-scale jet cores of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Our method uses
observed superluminal motions and observed brightness temperatures for a large
sample of AGN to constrain the characteristic intrinsic brightness temperature
of the sample as a whole. To study changes in intrinsic brightness temperature,
we assume that the Doppler factors of individual jets are constant in time as
justified by their relatively small changes in observed flux density. We find
that in their median-low brightness temperature state, the sources in our
sample have a narrow range of intrinsic brightness temperatures centered on a
characteristic temperature, T_int = 3 x 10^10 K, which is close to the value
expected for equipartition, when the energy in the radiating particles equals
the energy stored in the magnetic fields. However, in their maximum brightness
state, we find that sources in our sample have a characteristic intrinsic
brightness temperature greater than 2 x 10^11 K, which is well in excess of the
equipartition temperature. In this state, we estimate the energy in radiating
particles exceeds the energy in the magnetic field by a factor of ~ 10^5. We
suggest that the excess of particle energy when sources are in their maximum
brightness state is due to injection or acceleration of particles at the base
of the jet. Our results suggest that the common method of estimating jet
Doppler factors by using a single measurement of observed brightness
temperature and/or the assumption of equipartition may lead to large scatter or
systematic errors in the derived values.",2006-03-30T21:27:14Z
"From Supermassive Black Holes to Dwarf Elliptical Nuclei: a Mass
  Continuum","Considerable evidence suggests that supermassive black holes reside at the
centers of massive galactic bulges. At a lower galactic mass range, many dwarf
galaxies contain extremely compact nuclei that structurally resemble massive
globular clusters. We show that both these types of central massive objects
(CMO's) define a single unbroken relation between CMO mass and the luminosity
of their host galaxy spheroid. Equivalently, M_CMO is directly proportional to
the host spheroid mass over 4 orders of magnitude. We note that this result has
been simultaneously and independently identified by Cote et al. (2006), see
also Ferrarese et al. (2006). We therefore suggest that the dE,N nuclei may be
the low-mass analogs of supermassive black holes, and that these two types of
CMO's may have both developed starting from similar initial formation
processes. The overlap mass interval between the two types of CMO's is small,
and suggests that for M_CMO > 10^7 M_sun, the formation of a black hole was
strongly favored, perhaps because the initial gas infall to the center was too
rapid and violent for star formation to occur efficiently.",2006-03-29T21:00:03Z
On the fraction of X-ray obscured quasars in the local universe,"Recent wide area hard X-ray and soft Gamma ray surveys have shown that the
fraction of X-ray obscured AGNs in the local universe significantly decreases
with intrinsic luminosity. In this letter we point out that two correction have
to be made to the samples: 1) radio loud AGNs have to be excluded since their
X-ray emission might be dominated by the jet component; 2) Compton thick
sources have to be excluded too since their hard X-ray and soft gamma ray
emission are also strongly attenuated by Compton scattering. The soft gamma-ray
selected AGN samples obtained by SWIFT and INTEGRAL provide the best
opportunity to study the fraction of obscured AGN in the local universe in the
least biased way. We choose these samples to check if the corrections could
alter the above result on the fraction of obscured AGNs. We find that before
the corrections both samples show significant anti-correlation between L_X and
N_H, indicating obvious decrease in the fraction of obscured AGNs with
luminosity. However, after the corrections, we find only marginal evidence of
anti-correlation (at 98% confidence level) in the SWIFT sample, and no evidence
at all in the INTEGRAL sample which consists of comparable number of objects.
We conclude that current samples only show a marginal decrease in the fraction
of obscured AGNs in the local universe, and much larger samples are required to
reach a more robust conclusion.",2006-06-14T01:10:12Z
Dust in starburst nuclei and ULIRGs: SED models for observers,"We provide a library of some 7000 SEDs (available at www.eso.org/~rsiebenm)
for the nuclei of starburst and ultra luminous galaxies. Its purpose is to
quickly obtain estimates of the basic parameters, such as luminosity, size and
dust or gas mass and to predict the flux at yet unobserved wavelengths. The
procedure is simple and consists of finding an element in the library that
matches the observations. The objects may be in the local universe or at high
z.
  We calculate the radiative transfer in spherical symmetry for a stellar
cluster permeated by an interstellar medium with standard (Milky Way) dust
properties. The cluster contains two stellar populations: old bulge stars and
OB stars. Because the latter are young, a certain fraction of them will be
embedded in compact clouds which constitute hot spots that determine the MIR
fluxes.
  We present SEDs for a broad range of luminosities, sizes and obscurations. We
argue that the assumption of spherical symmetry and the neglect of clumpiness
of the medium are not severe shortcomings for computing the dust emission. The
validity of the approach is demonstrated by matching the SED of seven of the
best studied galaxies, including M82 and Arp220, by library elements. In all
cases, one finds an element which fits the observed SED very well, and the
parameters defining the element are in full accord with what is known about the
galaxy from detailed studies. We also compare our method of computing SEDs with
other techniques described in the literature.",2006-06-19T12:39:56Z
"Neutron stars in globular clusters: formation and observational
  manifestations","Population synthesis is used to model the number of neutron stars in globular
clusters that are observed as LMXBs and millisecond PSRs. The dynamical
interaction between binary and single stars in a GC are assumed to take place
with a permanently replenished ""background"" of single stars whose density
distribution keeps track with the cluster evolution as a whole and evolution of
single stars. We use the hypothesis (Podsiadlowski et al) that NS forming in
binary systems from components with initial masses \sim 8-12 M_\odot during the
electron-capture collapse of the degenerate O-Ne-Mg core do not acquire a high
space velocities (kicks). The remaining NSs (i.e. from single stars with M>8
M_\odot or binary comonents with M>12 M_\odot) are assumed to be born with high
kicks, as found from obsrevations of single pulsars (Hobbs et al. 2005). Under
this assumption, a sizeable fraction of NSs remain in GCs (about 1000 NSs in a
GC with a mass of 5\times 10^5 M_\odot). The number of ms PSRs formed in the
cluster via accretion spin-up in binaries is then about 10, which is consistent
with observations. Our modelling reproduces the observed shape of the X-ray
luminosity function for accreting NSs in binaries with normal and degenerate
components and the distribution of spin periods of ms PSRs in GCs under the
assumption of accretion-driven magnetic field decay of NSs up to a bottom value
of 10^8 G. The number of LMXBs and ms PSRs dynamically expelling from GCs is
also calculated.",2006-05-04T05:13:04Z
A Catalog of Emission line profiles for Planetary Nebulae,"Using the Cloudy_3D code (Morisset, this conference), we run a set of models
to build a catalog of emission line profiles of PNe. The goal is to cover the
main morphologies (spherical, ellipsoidal, bipolar, thin or thick shells) and
to compute profiles changing the orientation of the nebula, the expansion
velocity law (including or not turbulence), the position/size of the aperture.
The results is a huge set of profiles and PV-diagrams that can be compared to
observations as a help to derive morpho-kinematical properties of real objects.",2006-05-16T20:14:42Z
"Can the Brans-Dicke Gravity with $Λ$ Possibly be a Theory of Dark
  Matter?","The pure Brans-Dicke (BD) gravity with or without the cosmological constant
$\Lambda $ has been taken as a model theory for the dark matter. Indeed, there
has been a consensus that unless one modifies either the standard theory of
gravity, namely, general relativity, or the standard model for particle
physics, or both, one can never achieve a satisfying understanding of the
phenomena associated with dark matter and dark energy. Along this line, our
dark matter model in this work can be thought of as an attempt to modify the
gravity side alone in the simplest fashion to achieve the goal. Among others,
it is demonstrated that our model theory can successfully predict the emergence
of dark matter halo-like configuration in terms of a self-gravitating spacetime
solution to the BD field equations and reproduce the flattened rotation curve
in this dark halo-like object in terms of the non-trivial energy density of the
BD scalar field, which was absent in the context of general relativity where
Newton's constant is strictly a ``constant'' having no dynamics. Our model
theory, however, is not entirely without flaw, such as the prediction of
relativistic jets in all types of galaxies which actually is not the case.",2006-04-04T09:44:50Z
"Surface Brightness Profiles of Galactic Globular Clusters from Hubble
  Space Telescope Images","Hubble Space Telescope allows us to study the central surface brightness
profiles for globular clusters at unprecedented detail. We have mined the HST
archives to obtain 38 WFPC2 images of galactic globular clusters with adequate
exposure times and filters, which we use to measure their central structure. We
outline a reliable method to obtain surface brightness profiles from integrated
light that we test on an extensive set of simulated images. Most clusters have
central surface brightness about 0.5 mag brighter than previous measurements
made from ground-based data, with the largest differences around 2 magnitudes.
Including the uncertainties in the slope estimates, the surface brightness
slope distribution is consistent with half of the sample having flat cores and
the remaining half showing a gradual decline from 0 to -0.8
(dlog(Sigma)/dlogr). We deproject the surface brightness profiles in a
non-parametric way to obtain luminosity density profiles. The distribution of
luminosity density logarithmic slopes show similar features with half of the
sample between -0.4 and -1.8. These results are in contrast to our theoretical
bias that the central regions of globular clusters are either isothermal (i.e.
flat central profiles) or very steep (i.e. luminosity density slope ~-1.6) for
core-collapse clusters. With only 50% of our sample having central profiles
consistent with isothermal cores, King models appear to poorly represent most
globular clusters in their cores.",2006-04-11T20:46:25Z
"The X-ray properties of optically-selected z>0.6 clusters in the ESO
  Distant Cluster Survey","We present XMM-Newton observations of three optically-selected z > 0.6
clusters from the ESO Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS), comprising the first
results of a planned X-ray survey of the full EDisCS high-redshift sample. The
EDisCS clusters were identified in the Las Campanas Distant Cluster Survey as
surface brightness fluctuations in the optical sky and their masses and galaxy
populations are well described by extensive photometric and spectroscopic
observations. We detect two of the three clusters in the X-ray and place a firm
upper limit on diffuse emission in the third cluster field. We are able to
constrain the X-ray luminosity and temperature of the detected clusters and
estimate their masses. We find the X-ray properties of the detected EDisCS
clusters are similar to those of X-ray-selected clusters of comparable mass and
-- unlike other high-redshift, optically-selected clusters -- are consistent
with the T - sigma and L_x - sigma relations determined from X-ray selected
clusters at low redshift. The X-ray determined mass estimates are generally
consistent with those derived from weak lensing and spectroscopic analyses.
These preliminary results suggest that the novel method of optical selection
used to construct the EDisCS catalog may, like selection by X-ray luminosity,
be well-suited for identification of relaxed, high-redshift clusters whose
intracluster medium is in place and stable by z ~ 0.8.",2006-07-30T21:11:36Z
"The SAURON project - VII. Integral-field absorption and emission-line
  kinematics of 24 spiral galaxy bulges","(Abridged) We present observations of the stellar and gas kinematics for a
representative sample of 24 Sa galaxies obtained with our custom-built
integral-field spectrograph SAURON operating on the William Herschel Telescope.
Our maps typically cover the bulge dominated region. We find a significant
fraction of kinematically decoupled components (12/24), many of them displaying
central velocity dispersion minima. They are mostly aligned and co-rotating
with the main body of the galaxies, and are usually associated with dust discs
and rings detected in unsharp-masked images. Almost all the galaxies in the
sample (22/24) contain significant amounts of ionised gas which, in general, is
accompanied by the presence of dust. The kinematics of the ionised gas is
consistent with circular rotation in a disc co-rotating with respect to the
stars. The distribution of mean misalignments between the stellar and gaseous
angular momenta in the sample suggest that the gas has an internal origin. The
[OIII]/Hbeta ratio is usually very low, indicative of current star formation,
and shows various morphologies (ring-like structures, alignments with dust
lanes or amorphous shapes). The star formation rates in the sample are
comparable with that of normal disc galaxies. Low gas velocity dispersion
values appear to be linked to regions of intense star formation activity. We
interpret this result as stars being formed from dynamically cold gas in those
regions. In the case of NGC5953, the data suggest that we are witnessing the
formation of a kinematically decoupled component from cold gas being acquired
during the ongoing interaction with NGC5954.",2006-03-07T15:12:29Z
New signposts of massive star formation in the S235A-B region,"We report on new aspects of the star-forming region S235AB revealed through
high-resolution observations at radio and mid-infrared wavelengths. Using the
Very Large Array, we carried out sensitive observations of S235AB in the cm
continuum (6, 3.6, 1.3, and 0.7) and in the 22 GHz water maser line. These were
complemented with Spitzer Space Telescope Infrared Array Camera archive data to
clarify the correspondence between radio and IR sources. We made also use of
newly presented data from the Medicina water maser patrol, started in 1987, to
study the variability of the water masers found in the region. S235A is a
classical HII region whose structure is now well resolved. To the south, no
radio continuum emission is detected either from the compact molecular core or
from the jet-like structure observed at 3.3 mm, suggesting emission from dust
in both cases. We find two new compact radio continuum sources (VLA-1 and
VLA-2) and three separate maser spots. VLA-1 coincides with one of the maser
spots and with a previously identified IR source (M1). VLA-2 lies towards S235B
and represents the first radio detection from this peculiar nebula that may
represent an ionized wind from a more evolved star. The two other maser spots
coincide with an elongated structure previously observed within the molecular
core in the C34S line. This structure is perpendicular to a bipolar molecular
outflow observed in HCO+(1-0) and may trace the associated equatorial disk. The
Spitzer images reveal a red object towards the molecular core. This is the most
viable candidate for the embedded source originating the outflow and maser
phenomenology. The picture emerging from these and previous data shows the
extreme complexity of a small (< 0.5 pc) star-forming region where widely
different stages of stellar evolution are present.",2006-03-30T13:44:38Z
"On radio-bright Active Galactic Nuclei in a complete Spectroscopic
  Redshift Survey","Analysis of the frequency and physical properties of galaxies with
star-formation and AGN activity in different environments in the local universe
is a cornerstone for understanding structure formation and galaxy evolution. We
have built a new multiwavelength catalog for galaxies in a complete redshift
survey (the 15R Survey), gathering information on their H-alpha, R-band, radio,
far-infrared, and X-ray emission, as well as their radio and optical
morphologies, and have developed a classification scheme to compare different
selection methods and to select accurately samples of radio emitting galaxies
with AGN and star-forming activity. While alternative classification schemes do
not lead to major differences for star-forming galaxies, we show that
spectroscopic and photometric classifications of AGN lead to incomplete
samples. In particular, a large population of AGN-containing galaxies with
absorption-line spectra, and in many cases extended radio structures (jets,
lobes), is missed in the standard Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich emission-line
classification of active galaxies. This missed class of objects accounts for
roughly half of the radio AGN population. Similarly, for X-ray selected AGN in
our sample, we find that absorption-line AGN account for half of the sample.
Spectroscopically unremarkable, passive galaxies with AGN activity are not an
exception, but the norm, and we show that although they exist in all
environments, these systems preferentially reside in higher density regions.
Because of the existence of this population, the fractional abundance of AGN
increases with increasing density, in contrast to some published results based
on emission-line AGN extracted from the 15R, Sloan and 2DF redshift surveys.",2006-07-17T18:28:24Z
"Galaxy surveys, inhomogeneous reionization, and dark energy","We examine the effect of inhomogeneous reionization on the galaxy power
spectrum and the consequences for probing dark energy. To model feedback during
reionization, we apply an ansatz setting the galaxy overdensity proportional to
the underlying ionization field. Thus, inhomogeneous reionization may leave an
imprint in the galaxy power spectrum. We evolve this imprint to low redshift
and use the Fisher-matrix formalism to assess the effect on parameter
estimation. We show that a combination of low- (z=0.3) and high- (z=3) redshift
galaxy surveys can constrain the size of cosmological HII regions during
reionization. This imprint can also cause confusion when using baryon
oscillations or other features of the galaxy power spectrum to probe the dark
energy. We show that when bubbles are large, and hence detectable, our ability
to constrain w can be degraded by up to 50%. When bubbles are small, the
imprint has little or no effect on measuring dark-energy parameters.",2006-04-18T17:01:33Z
"Non-Gaussian Covariance of CMB B-modes of Polarization and Parameter
  Degradation","The B-mode polarization lensing signal is a useful probe of the neutrino mass
and to a lesser extent the dark energy equation of state as the signal depends
on the integrated mass power spectrum between us and the last scattering
surface. This lensing B-mode signal, however, is non-Gaussian and the resulting
non-Gaussian covariance to the power spectrum cannot be ignored as correlations
between B-mode bins are at a level of 0.1. For temperature and E-mode
polarization power spectra, the non-Gasussian covariance is not significant,
where we find correlations at the 10^{-5} level even for adjacent bins. The
resulting degradation on neutrino mass and dark energy equation of state is
about a factor of 2 to 3 when compared to the case where statistics are simply
considered to be Gaussian. We also discuss parameter uncertainties achievable
in upcoming experiments and show that at a given angular resolution for
polarization observations, increasing the sensitivity beyond a certain noise
value does not lead to an improved measurement of the neutrino mass and dark
energy equation of state with B-mode power spectrum. For Planck, the resulting
constraints on the sum of the neutrino masses is ~ 0.2 eV and on the dark
energy equation of state parameter we find, sigma_w ~ 0.5.",2006-07-21T06:26:33Z
"GeV photons from up-scattering of supernova shock breakout X-rays by an
  outside GRB jet","Shock breakout X-ray emission has been reported for the first time from a
supernova connected with a gamma-ray burst, namely GRB060218/SN2006aj. The
gamma-ray emission and the power-law decaying X-ray afterglow are ascribed to a
highly relativistic jet, while the thermal soft X-rays are thought to be
produced when the radiation-dominated shock breaks from the optically thick
stellar wind. We study the inverse Compton emission of the breakout thermal
soft X-rays scattered by relativistic electrons in the jet forward shock, which
is expected to be at larger radii than the breakout shock. This IC emission
produces sub-GeV to GeV photons, which may be detectable by GLAST. The
detection of such GeV photons simultaneously with the supernova shock breakout
emission would give evidence for the presence of a GRB jet ahead of the shock
while the shock is breaking out. The anisotropic scattering between the X-rays
and relativistic electrons may lead to large angle emission outside of the jet
opening angle. This has implications for the detection of GeV photons from
burstless type Ib/c hypernova shock breakout, which due to its more isotropic
emission might be observed with wide-field X-ray cameras such as LOBSTER.",2006-03-27T19:47:36Z
Mass Accretion onto T Tauri Stars,"It is now accepted that accretion onto classical T Tauri stars is controlled
by the stellar magnetosphere, yet to date most accretion models have assumed
that their magnetic fields are dipolar. By considering a simple steady state
accretion model with both dipolar and complex magnetic fields we find a
correlation between mass accretion rate and stellar mass of the form $\dot{M}
\propto M_{\ast}^{\alpha}$, with our results consistent within observed
scatter. For any particular stellar mass there can be several orders of
magnitude difference in the mass accretion rate, with accretion filling factors
of a few percent. We demonstrate that the field geometry has a significant
effect in controlling the location and distribution of hot spots, formed on the
stellar surface from the high velocity impact of accreting material. We find
that hot spots are often at mid to low latitudes, in contrast to what is
expected for accretion to dipolar fields, and that particularly for higher mass
stars, the accretion flow is predominantly carried by open field lines.",2006-06-28T09:59:31Z
HD 98618: A Star Closely Resembling our Sun,"Despite the observational effort carried out in the last few decades, no
perfect solar twin has been found to date. An important milestone was achieved
a decade ago by Porto de Mello & da Silva, who showed that 18 Sco is almost a
solar twin. In the present work, we use extremely high resolution (R = 10^5)
high S/N Keck HIRES spectra to carry out a differential analysis of 16 solar
twin candidates. We show that HD 98618 is the second-closest solar twin and
that the fundamental parameters of both HD 98618 and 18 Sco are very similar
(within a few percent) to the host star of our solar system, including the
likelihood of hosting a terrestrial planet within their habitable zone. We
suggest that these stars should be given top priority in exoplanet and SETI
surveys.",2006-03-09T03:05:17Z
"The formation of massive stars: accretion, disks and the development of
  hypercompact HII regions","The hypothesis that massive stars form by accretion can be investigated by
simple analytical calculations that describe the effect that the formation of a
massive star has on its own accretion flow. Within a simple accretion model
that includes angular momentum, that of gas flow on ballistic trajectories
around a star, the increasing ionization of a massive star growing by accretion
produces a three-stage evolutionary sequence. The ionization first forms a
small quasi-spherical HII region gravitationally trapped within the accretion
flow. At this stage the flow of ionized gas is entirely inward. As the
ionization increases, the HII region transitions to a bipolar morphology in
which the inflow is replaced by outflow within a narrow range of angle with
about the bipolar axis. At higher rates of ionization, the opening angle of the
outflow region progressively increases. Eventually, in the third stage, the
accretion is confined to a thin region about an equatorial disk. Throughout
this early evolution, the HII region is of hypercompact to ultracompact size
depending on the mass of the enclosed star or stars. These small HII regions
whose dynamics are dominated by stellar gravitation and accretion are different
than compact and larger HII regions whose dynamics are dominated by the thermal
pressure of the ionized gas.",2006-03-31T16:49:18Z
"The Remarkable Stability of Probable Black Hole Low-Mass X-ray Binaries
  in Nearby Galaxies","The most luminous X-ray sources in nearby elliptical galaxies are likely
black hole low-mass X-ray binaries (BHLMXBs). In the Milky Way, such systems
are always transient, and with the exception of GRS1915+105 have burst
durations on the order of weeks or months. However, the low duty cycle of
short-duration outburst BHLMXBs makes it improbable that any one source would
be caught in an outburst during a single snapshot observation. Long-duration
outburst BHLMXBs, although much rarer, would be detectable in a series of
snapshot observations separated by several years. Our analysis of multi-epoch
Chandra observations of the giant elliptical galaxies NGC1399 and M87 separated
by 3.3 and 5.3 yr, respectively, finds that all 37 luminous (>8 x 10^38 ergs/s)
X-ray sources that were present in the first epoch observations were still in
outburst in all of the following observations. Many of these probable
long-duration outburst BHLMXBs reside within globular clusters of the galaxies.
Conversely, no definitive short-duration outburst BHLMXBs were detected in any
of the observations. This places an upper limit on the ratio of
short--to--long-duration outbursters that is slightly lower, but consistent
with what is seen in the Milky Way. The fact that none of the luminous sources
turned off between the first and last epochs places a 95 per cent lower limit
of 50 yr on the mean burst duration of the long-duration outburst sources. The
most likely scenario for the origin of these sources is that they are
long-period (>30 d) black hole binaries with a red giant donor, much like
GRS1915+105. However, unlike GRS1915+105, most of the sources show only modest
variability from epoch to epoch.",2006-07-17T20:06:13Z
"SDSS J1534+1615AB: A Novel T Dwarf Binary Found with Keck Laser Guide
  Star Adaptive Optics and the Potential Role of Binarity in the L/T Transition","We have resolved the newly discovered T dwarf SDSS J1534+1615 into a 0.11''
binary using the Keck sodium laser guide star adaptive optics system. With an
integrated-light spectral type of T3.5, this binary provides a new benchmark
for studying the distinctive J-band brightening previously noted among early
and mid-T dwarfs, using two brown dwarfs with different spectral types but
having a common metallicity and age and very similar surface gravities. We
estimate spectral types of T1.5+/-0.5 and T5.5+/-0.5 for the two components
based on their near-IR colors, consistent with modeling the integrated-light
spectrum as the blend of two components. The observed near-IR flux ratios are
unique compared to all previously known substellar binaries: the component that
is fainter at H and K' is brighter at J. This inversion of the near-IR fluxes
is a manifestation of the J-band brightening within this individual binary
system. Therefore, SDSS 1534+1615 demonstrates that the brightening can be
intrinsic to ultracool photospheres (e.g., arising from cloud disruption and/or
rapid increase in cloud sedimentation) and does not necessarily result from
physical variations among the observed ensemble of T dwarfs (e.g., a range in
masses, ages and/or metallicities). We suggest that the apparently large
amplitude of the J-band brightening may be due to a high incidence of
unresolved binaries and that the true amplitude of the phenomenon could be more
modest. This scenario would imply that truly single objects in these spectral
subclasses are relatively rare, in agreement with the small effective
temperature range inferred for the L/T transition.",2006-05-01T20:00:27Z
Constraining the GRB Collimation with a Survey for Orphan Afterglows,"Gamma-ray bursts are believed to be produced in highly-relativistic
collimated outflows. Support for this comes among others from the association
of the times of detected breaks in the decay of afterglow light curves with the
collimation angle of the jets. An alternative approach to estimate a limit on
the collimation angle uses GRB afterglows without detected prompt-emission
counterparts. Here we report on the analysis of a dedicated survey for the
search of these orphan afterglows using the Wide Field Imager at the 2.2m
MPI/ESO telescope at La Silla, Chile. We monitored ~12 square degrees. in up to
25 nights typically spaced by one to two nights with a limiting magnitude of
R=23. Four previously unknown optical transients were discovered and three of
these associated with a flare star, a cataclysmic variable and a dwarf nova.
The fourth source shows indications for an extragalactic origin but the sparse
sampling of the light curve prevents a reliable classification. We discuss the
results in the context of the collimation of GRBs.",2006-03-11T20:59:17Z
"New symmetries in microphysics, new stable forms of matter around us","Extension of particle symmetry implies new conserved charges and the lightest
particles, possessing such charges, should be stable. Created in early
Universe, stable charged heavy leptons and quarks can exist and, hidden in
elusive atoms bound by Coulomb attraction, can play the role of dark matter.
The problem of this scenario is that in the expanding Universe it is not
possible to recombine all the charged particles into elusive ""atoms"", and
positively charged particles, which escape such recombination, bind with
electrons in atoms of anomalous isotopes with pregalactic abundance, generally
exceeding terrestrial upper limits. Realistic scenarios of composite dark
matter, avoiding this problem of anomalous isotope over-production, inevitably
predict the existence of primordial ""atoms"", in which primordial helium traps
all the free negatively charged heavy constituents with charge -2. Study of the
possibility for such primordial heavy alpha-particle with compensated charge to
exist as well as the search for the stable charged constituents in cosmic rays
and accelerators provide crucial test for the new forms of stable matter.",2006-07-04T11:28:41Z
Cosmological Acceleration: Dark Energy or Modified Gravity?,"We review the evidence for recently accelerating cosmological expansion or
""dark energy"", either a negative pressure constituent in General Relativity
(Dark Energy) or modified gravity (Dark Gravity), without any Dark Energy
constituent. If constituent Dark Energy does not exist, so that our universe is
now dominated by pressure-free matter, Einstein gravity must be modified at low
curvature. The vacuum symmetry of any Robertson-Walker universe then
characterizes Dark Gravity as low- or high-curvature modifications of Einstein
gravity. The dynamics of either kind of ""dark energy"" cannot be derived from
the homogeneous expansion alone, but requires also observing the growth of
inhomogeneities. Present and projected observations are all consistent with a
small fine tuned cosmological constant, with nearly static Dark Energy, or with
gravity modified at cosmological scales. The growth of cosmological
fluctuations will potentially distinguish static ""dark energy"" from dynamic
""dark energy"" with equation of state $w(z)$ either changing rapidly or tracking
the background matter. But to cosmologically distinguish $\Lambda$CDM from
modified gravity will require a weak lensing shear survey more ambitious than
any now projected. Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati modifications of Einstein gravity
may also be detected in refined bservations in the solar system or at the
intermediate Vainstein scale.
  Dark Energy's epicyclic character, failure to explain the original Cosmic
Coincidence (""Why now?"") without fine tuning, inaccessibility to laboratory or
solar system tests, along with braneworld theories, now motivate future
precision solar system, Vainstein-scale and cosmological-scale studies of Dark
Gravity.",2006-05-08T14:38:52Z
The VIMOS VLT Deep Survey: The build-up of the colour-density relation,"We investigate the redshift and luminosity evolution of the galaxy
colour-density relation using the data from the First Epoch VIMOS-VLT Deep
Survey (VVDS). The size (6582 galaxies), depth (I_AB<=24) and redshift sampling
rate of the survey enable us to reconstruct the 3D galaxy environment on
relatively local scales (R=5 Mpc) up to z~1.5. Particular attention has been
devoted to calibrate a density reconstruction scheme, which factors out survey
selection effects and reproduces in an unbiased way the underlying `real'
galaxy environment. While at lower redshift we confirm the existence of a steep
colour-density relation, with the fraction of the reddest(/bluest) galaxies of
the same luminosity increasing(/decreasing) as a function of density, this
trend progressively disappears in the highest redshift bins investigated. The
rest frame u*-g' colour-magnitude diagram shows a bimodal pattern in both low
and high density environments up to z~1.5. We find that the bimodal
distribution is not universal but strongly depends upon environment: at lower
redshifts the colour-magnitude diagrams in low and high density regions are
significantly different while the progressive weakening of the colour-density
relation causes the two bimodal distributions to nearly mirror each other in
the highest redshift bin investigated. Both the colour-density and the
colour-magnitude-density relations appear to be a transient, cumulative product
of genetic and environmental factors operating over at least a period of 9 Gyr.
These findings support an evolutionary scenario in which star formation/gas
depletion processes are accelerated in more luminous objects and in high
density environments: star formation activity is shifting with cosmic time
towards lower luminosity (downsizing), and out of high density environments.",2006-03-08T16:57:57Z
"Cosmological and Astrophysical Parameter Measurements with 21-cm
  Anisotropies During the Era of Reionization","We study the prospects for extracting cosmological and astrophysical
parameters from the low radio frequency 21-cm background due to the spin-flip
transition of neutral Hydrogen during and prior to the reionization of the
Universe. We make use of the angular power spectrum of 21-cm anisotropies,
which exists due to inhomogeneities in the neutral Hydrogen density field, the
gas temperature field, the gas velocity field, and the spatial distribution of
the Lyman-$\alpha$ intensity field associated with first luminous sources that
emit UV photons. We extract parameters that describe both the underlying mass
power spectrum and the global cosmology, as well as a set of simplified
astrophysical parameters that connect fluctuations in the dark matter to those
that govern 21-cm fluctuations. We also marginalize over a model for the
foregrounds at low radio frequencies. In this general description, we find
large degeneracies between cosmological parameters and the astrophysical
parameters, though such degeneracies are reduced when strong assumptions are
made with respect to the spin temperature relative to the CMB temperature or
when complicated sources of anisotropy in the brightness temperature are
ignored. Some of the degeneracies between cosmological and astrophysical
parameters are broken when 21-cm anisotropy measurements are combined with
information from the CMB, such as the temperature and the polarization
measurements with Planck. While the overall improvement on the cosmological
parameter estimates is not significant when measurements from first-generation
interferometers are combined with Planck, such a combination can measure
astrophysical parameters such as the ionization fraction in several redshift
bins with reasonable accuracy.",2006-05-26T20:06:31Z
Fe II Emission in 14 Low-Redshift Quasars: I - Observations,"We present the spectra of 14 quasars with a wide coverage of rest wavelengths
from 1000 to 7300 A. The redshift ranges from z = 0.061 to 0.555 and the
luminosity from M_{B} = -22.69 to -26.32. We describe the procedure of
generating the template spectrum of Fe II line emission from the spectrum of a
narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy I Zw 1 that covers two wavelength regions of
2200-3500 A and 4200-5600 A. Our template Fe II spectrum is semi-empirical in
the sense that the synthetic spectrum calculated with the CLOUDY
photoionization code is used to separate the Fe II emission from the Mg II
line. The procedure of measuring the strengths of Fe II emission lines is
twofold; (1) subtracting the continuum components by fitting models of the
power-law and Balmer continua in the continuum windows which are relatively
free from line emissions, and (2) fitting models of the Fe II emission based on
the Fe II template to the continuum-subtracted spectra. From 14 quasars, we
obtained the Fe II fluxes in five wavelength bands, the total flux of Balmer
continuum, and the fluxes of Mg II, Halpha, and other emission lines, together
with the full width at half maxima (FWHMs) of these lines. Regression analysis
was performed by assuming a linear relation between any two of these
quantities. Eight correlations were found with a confidence level higher than
99%. The fact that six of these eight are related to FWHM or M_{BH} may imply
that M_{BH} is a fundamental quantity that controls Gamma or the spectral
energy distribution (SED) of the incident continuum, which in turn controls the
Fe II emission. Furthermore, it is worthy of noting that Fe II(O1)/Fe II(U1) is
found to tightly correlate with Fe II(O1)/Mg II, but not with Fe II(U1)/Mg II.",2006-06-02T04:18:52Z
"Local Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and synchrotron modulation in Pulsar
  Wind Nebulae","We present here a series of numerical simulations of the development of
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in a relativistically hot plasma. The physical
parameters in the unperturbed state are chosen to be representative of local
conditions encountered in Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe), with a main magnetic
field perpendicular to a mildly relativistic shear layers. By using a numerical
code for Relativistic MHD, we investigate the effect of an additional magnetic
field component aligned with the shear velocity, and we follow the evolution of
the instability to the saturation and turbulent regimes. Based on the resulting
flow structure, we then compute synchrotron maps in order to evaluate the
signature of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the emission and we investigate
how the time scale and the amplitude of the synchrotron modulations depend on
shear velocity and magnetic field. Finally we compare our results to the
observed variable features in the Crab Nebula. We show that the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability cannot account for the wisps variability, but it
might be responsible for the time dependent filamentary structure observed in
the main torus.",2006-03-17T20:41:54Z
"Detection of VHE radiation from the BL Lac PG 1553+113 with the MAGIC
  telescope","In 2005 and 2006, the MAGIC telescope has observed very high energy gamma-ray
emission from the distant BL Lac object PG 1553+113. The overall significance
of the signal is 8.8 sigma for 18.8h observation time. The light curve shows no
significant flux variations on a daily time-scale, the flux level during 2005
was, however, significantly higher compared to 2006. The differential energy
spectrum between ~90 GeV and 500 GeV is well described by a power law with
photon index Gamma = 4.2 +- 0.3. The combined 2005 and 2006 energy spectrum
provides an upper limit of z=0.74 on the redshift of the object.",2006-06-07T17:15:29Z
"A Survey for ""Normal"" Irregular Satellites Around Neptune: Limits to
  Completeness","We surveyed 1.75 square degrees of sky near Neptune to an R-band 50%
detection efficiency of 25.8 mags (corresponding to radii of about 17 km for an
assumed albedo of 0.04). We discovered one new outer satellite, Psamathe
(S/2003 N1), about 20 km in radius and having a distant retrograde orbit and
moderate eccentricity. Until 2003 Neptune was only known to have two satellites
which exhibited orbital signatures indicative of capture. Both of these, Triton
and Nereid, are unusual when compared to the irregular satellites of other
giant planets. With recent discoveries of four additional satellites by Holman
et al. (2004) it is now apparent that Neptune has a distant ``normal''
irregular satellite system in which the satellites have radii and orbital
properties similar to those of the satellites of other giant planets. We find
that the satellite size distribution at Neptune is not well determined given
the few objects known to date, being especially sensitive to the inclusion of
Triton and Nereid in the sample. Finally, we note that Psamathe and S/2002 N4
have similar semi-major axes, inclinations and eccentricities. They may be
fragments of a once larger satellite.",2006-04-26T20:27:17Z
"Non linear particle acceleration at non-relativistic shock waves in the
  presence of self-generated turbulence","Particle acceleration at astrophysical shocks may be very efficient if
magnetic scattering is self-generated by the same particles. This nonlinear
process adds to the nonlinear modification of the shock due to the dynamical
reaction of the accelerated particles on the shock. Building on a previous
general solution of the problem of particle acceleration with arbitrary
diffusion coefficients (Amato & Blasi, 2005), we present here the first
semi-analytical calculation of particle acceleration with both effects taken
into account at the same time: charged particles are accelerated in the
background of Alfven waves that they generate due to the streaming instability,
and modify the dynamics of the plasma in the shock vicinity.",2006-06-23T16:08:55Z
"Gaussian Decomposition of HI Surveys - II. Separation of Problematic
  Gaussians","We have analyzed the Gaussian decomposition of the Leiden/Dwingeloo Survey
(LDS) of galactic neutral hydrogen for the presence of Gaussians probably not
directly related to galactic HI emission. It is demonstrated that at least
three classes of such components can be distinguished. The narrowest Gaussians
mostly represent stronger random noise peaks in profiles and some still
uncorrected radio-interferences. Many of slightly wider weak Gaussians are
caused by increased uncertainties near the profile edges and with the still
increasing width the baseline problems become dominating among weak components.
Statistical criteria are given for separation of the parameter space regions,
most likely populated with the problematic components from those where the
Gaussians are with higher probability describing the actual Milky Way HI
emission. The same analysis is applied to the Leiden/Argentina/Bonn survey
(LAB). It is demonstrated that the selection criteria for dividing the
parameter space are to a great extent independent of the particular survey in
use. The presence of the baseline problems in the LDS is indicated by the
peculiarities of the distribution of the widest Gaussians in the sky. A similar
plot for the northern part of the LAB demonstrates considerably lower numbers
of spurious components, but there are still problems with the southern part of
the LAB. The strange characteristics of the observational noise in the southern
part of the LAB are pointed out.",2006-04-28T14:21:30Z
Meteorologic parameters analysis above Dome C made with ECMWF data,"In this paper we present the characterization of all the principal
meteorological parameters (wind speed and direction, pressure, absolute and
potential temperature) extended over 25 km from the ground and over two years
(2003 and 2004) above the Antarctic site of Dome C. The data set is composed by
'analyses' provided by the General Circulation Model (GCM) of the European
Center for Medium Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and they are part of the catalog
MARS. A monthly and seasonal (summer and winter time) statistical analysis of
the results is presented. The Richardson number is calculated for each month of
the year over 25 km to study the stability/instability of the atmosphere. This
permits us to trace a map indicating where and when the optical turbulence has
the highest probability to be triggered on the whole troposphere, tropopause
and stratosphere. We finally try to predict the best expected isoplanatic angle
and wavefront coherence time employing the Richardson number maps, the wind
speed profiles and simple analytical models of CN2 vertical profiles.",2006-06-21T14:25:16Z
"The XMM Large Scale Structure Survey: Properties and Two-Point Angular
  Correlations of Point-like Sources","We analyze X-ray sources detected over 4.2 pseudo-contiguous sq. deg. in the
0.5-2 keV and 2-10 keV bands down to fluxes of 2x10^{-15} and 8x10^{-15}
erg/s/cm^2 respectively, as part of the XMM Large Scale Structure Survey. The
logN-logS in both bands shows a steep slope at bright fluxes, but agrees well
with other determinations below ~2x10^{-14} erg/s/cm^2. The detected sources
resolve close to 30 per cent of the X-ray background in the 2-10 keV band. We
study the two-point angular clustering of point sources using nearest
neighbours and correlation function statistics and find a weak, positive signal
for ~1130 sources in the 0.5-2 keV band, but no correlation for ~400 sources in
the 2-10 keV band below scales of 100 arcsec. A sub-sample of ~200 faint
sources with hard X-ray count ratios, that is likely to be dominated by
obscured AGN, does show a positive signal with the data allowing for a large
scaling of the angular correlation length, but only at the ~2 (3) sigma level,
based on re-sampling (Poisson) statistics. We discuss possible implications and
emphasize the importance of wider, complete surveys in order to fully
understand the large scale structure of the X-ray sky.",2006-07-07T12:21:46Z
"Discovery of new Milky Way star cluster candidates in the 2MASS point
  source catalog. V. Follow-up observations of the young stellar cluster
  candidates RCW87, [BDSB2003]164 and [DBSB2003]172","Massive clusters are more often found in actively star forming galaxies than
in quiescent ones, similar to the Milky Way. We have carried out an extensive
survey of obscured Milky Way clusters to determine whether our Galaxy is still
forming such objects. Near-infrared spectral classification of some probable
cluster members was used to derive the distances to the cluster candidates.
Isochrone analysis of deep near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams allowed us to
obtain age and mass estimates. We report the physical parameters of three
cluster candidates:
  RCW87 is approx. 25 Myr old, located at a distance of D=7.6 Kpc in the
general direction of the Galactic center. Adding the mass of the suspected
cluster members we obtain an estimated total cluster mass of approx. 10300
solar masses. The mid-infrared photometry indicates that some next-generation
star formation is on-going in the associated HII region, probably triggered by
supernovae or stellar wind from the older stars in RCW87.
  The brightest member of [BDSB2003]164 is an O5V type star, based on our
spectroscopy. This limits the cluster age to less than a few million years. The
estimated total mass is approx. 1760 solar masses and the distance is D=3.2
Kpc.
  [DBSB2003]172 lacks central concentration and most likely this is not a
cluster but an extended star forming region.
  The high mass of RCW87 -- if confirmed -- puts this object in line with
Arches and Quintuplet, among the most young massive clusters in the Galaxy.
Further study is necessary to confirm this important result.",2006-05-20T00:07:01Z
What is special about HBRPs,"The Parkes Multibeam Survey led to the identification ofa number of
long-period radio pulsars with magnetic field well above the quantum critical
field of 4.4 times 10 to 13 G (defined as high magnetic field radio pulsars -
HBRPs). Traditional pulsar emission theories postulate that radio emission is
suppressed above this critical field. The aim of thisproject is to understand
emission properties of HBRPs.",2006-04-18T03:13:13Z
Sub-Structures in the Halo of the Milky Way,"The latest results of the QUEST survey for RR Lyrae stars are described. This
survey, which is designed to find and characterize sub-structures in the halo
of our Galaxy, has covered about 700 square degrees of the sky and has detected
693 RR Lyrae stars, most of which are new discoveries. The spatial distribution
of the RR Lyrae stars reveals several interesting groups in the halo. Some of
them appear to be related to previous detections of the destruction of dwarf
spheroidal galaxies (the Sagittarius tidal streams, the Virgo stellar stream,
the Monoceros ring) or globular clusters (Palomar 5), while others still have
an unknown origin.",2006-05-18T21:44:28Z
2-Dimensional Kinematics of Simulated Disc Merger Remnants,"We present a two-dimensional kinematic analysis for a sample of simulated
binary disc merger remnants with mass ratios 1:1 and 3:1. For the progenitor
discs we used pure stellar models as well as models with 10% of their mass in
gas. A multitude of phenomena also observed in real galaxies are found in the
simulations. These include misaligned rotation, embedded discs, gas rings,
counter-rotating cores and kinematic misaligned discs. Using the 2D maps we
illustrate projection effects and the change in properties of a merger remnant
when gas is included in the merger. We find that kinematic peculiar subsystems
are preferably formed in equal mass mergers. Equal-mass collisionless remnants
can show almost no rotation, regular rotation or strong kinematic misalignment.
The inclusion of gas makes the remnants appear more round(1:1) and
axisymmetric(3:1). Counter-Rotating Cores (CRCs) are almost exclusively formed
in equal-mass mergers with a dissipational component. 3:1 remnants show a much
more regular structure. We quantify these properties by applying the kinemetric
methods recently developed by Krajnovi\'c et al. This work will help to
understand observations of elliptical galaxies with 2D field spectrographs,
like SAURON.",2006-06-07T10:48:02Z
Neutrino detectors in ice: results and perspectives,"The AMANDA neutrino detector has been in operation at the South Pole for
several years. A number of searches for extraterrestrial sources of high energy

to a cubic kilometer and 9 out of 80 planned IceCube strings have been deployed
to date. We present the status for both detectors.",2006-06-09T14:37:03Z
Supernova Fallback: A Possible Site for the r-Process,"The conditions for the leading r-process site candidate, neutrino-driven
winds, can not be reproduced self-consistently in current supernova models. For
that reason, we investigate an alternate model involving the mass ejected by
fallback in a supernova explosion, through hydrodynamic and nucleosynthesis
calculations. The nucleosynthetic products of this ejected material produces
r-process elements, including those in the vicinity of the elusive 3rd peak at
mass number 195. Trans-iron element production beyond the second peak is made
possible by a rapid (<1ms) freezeout of alpha particles which leaves behind a
large nucleon (including protons!) to r-process seed ratio. This rapid phase is
followed by a relatively long (>15 ms) simmering phase at ~2e9 K, which is the
thermodynamic consequence of the hydrodynamic trajectory of the turbulent flows
in the fallback outburst. During the slow phase high mass elements beyond the
second peak are first made through rapid capture of both protons and neutrons.
The flow stays close to valley of stability during this phase. After freeze-out
of protons the remaining neutrons cause a shift out to short-lived isotopes as
is typical for the r-process. A low electron fraction isn't required in this
model, however, the detailed final distribution is sensitive to the electron
fraction. Our simulations suggest that supernova fallback is a viable
alternative scenario for the r-process.",2006-06-19T14:43:50Z
A New Robust Low-Scatter X-ray Mass Indicator for Clusters of Galaxies,"We present comparison of X-ray proxies for the total cluster mass, including
the spectral temperature (Tx), gas mass measured within r500 (Mg), and the new
proxy, Yx, which is a simple product of Tx and Mg and is related to the total
thermal energy of the ICM. We use mock Chandra images constructed for a sample
of clusters simulated with the eulerian N-body+gasdynamics adaptive mesh
refinement ART code in the concordance LCDM cosmology. The simulations achieve
high spatial and mass resolution and include radiative cooling, star formation,
and other processes accompanying galaxy formation. Our analysis shows that
simulated clusters exhibit a high degree of regularity and tight correlations
between the considered observables and total mass. The normalizations of the
M-Tx, Mg-Tx, and M-Yx relations agree to better than 10-15% with the current
observational measurements of these relations. Our results show that Yx is the
best mass proxy with a remarkably low scatter of only ~5-7% in M500 for a fixed
Yx, at both low and high redshifts and regardless of whether clusters are
relaxed or not. In addition, we show that redshift evolution of the Yx-M500
relation is close to the self-similar prediction, which makes Yx a very
attractive mass indicator for measurements of the cluster mass function from
X-ray selected samples.",2006-03-09T20:53:42Z
"Optical parameters of the nonisothermal Uranus's and Neptune's
  atmospheres","A method of the calculation of optical parameters of the nonisothermal giant
planet atmospheres was developed using detailed intensity data of Raman
scattering. We have used the model of Morozhenko (A.V. Morozhenko, 1997) as a
baseline. In such a way, using observational data of Uranus and Neptune
(E.Karkoschka, 1994), the spectral values of ratio of optical depth components:
aerosol and gas components \tau a/ \tau R, absorbing and scattering components
\tau a/ \tau R, and also single scattering albedo of aerosol component
corrected for Raman scattering \omega were obtained (where \tau a, \tau R are
aerosol and gas components, and \tau ? is absorbing components of effective
optical depths of the formation of diffusely reflected irradiation). The
averaged value of ratio \tau a/ \tau R is 0.96 but it slowly decreases in the
spectral range of 350-450nm for Uranus and \tau a/ \tau R is 1.35 for Neptune.",2006-07-10T14:14:35Z
Massive-Star Supernovae as Major Dust Factories,"We present late-time optical and mid-infrared observations of the Type-II
supernova 2003gd in NGC 628. Mid-infrared excesses consistent with cooling dust
in the ejecta are observed 499-678 days after outburst, and are accompanied by
increasing optical extinction and growing asymmetries in the emission-line
profiles. Radiative-transfer models show that up to 0.02 solar masses of dust
has formed within the ejecta, beginning as early as 250 days after outburst.
These observations show that dust formation in supernova ejecta can be
efficient and that massive-star supernovae can be major dust producers
throughout the history of the Universe.",2006-06-06T21:59:34Z

Possible Application of Wavefront Coding to the LSST,"Wavefront Coding has been applied as a means to increase the effective depth

technique to increase the depth of focus of the LSST and the resulting
advantages for the construction and operation of the facility, as well as
possible drawbacks. It may be possible to apply Wavefront Coding without
changing the current LSST design, in which case Wavefront Coding might merit
further study as a risk mitigation strategy.",2006-06-30T17:41:54Z
Many binaries among NEAs,"The number of binary asteroids in the near-Earth region might be
significantly higher than expected. While Bottke and Melosh (1996) suggested
that about 15% of the NEAs are binaries, as indicated from the frequency of
double craters, and Pravec and Harris (2000) suggested that half of the
fast-rotating NEAs are binaries, our recent study of Aten NEA lightcurves shows
that the fraction of binary NEAs might be even higher than 50%. We found two
asteroids with asynchronous binary characteristics such as two additive periods
and fast rotation of the primary fragment. We also identified three asteroids
with synchronous binary characteristics such as amplitude higher than one
magnitude, U-shaped lightcurve maxima and V-shaped lightcurve minima. These
five binaries were detected out of a sample of eight asteroids observed,
implying a 63% binarity frequency. Confirmation of this high binary population
requires the study of a larger representative sample. However, any mitigation
program that requires the deflection or demise of a potential impactor will
have to factor in the possibility that the target is a binary or multiple
asteroid system.",2006-07-07T08:51:31Z
A Simple Model For Mid-Infrared Emission from Normal Galaxies,"We have combined up-to-date stellar population synthesis models, a simple
radiative transfer approach, and a fully comprehensive dust model with the aim
of developing a simple but quantitative way of interpreting the mid-infrared
spectra of galaxies. We apply these models to the observed correlations of
mid-infrared luminosities (at 8 and 24 micron) with the star-formation rate of
normal galaxies and find that the observations are naturally reproduced by our
models. We further find that the observed 24 micron correlation places a weak
constraint on relative distribution of dust and stars.",2006-03-17T16:59:30Z
"Constraining the population of 6 < z < 10 star-forming galaxies with
  deep near-IR images of lensing clusters","(abridged) We present the first results of our deep survey of lensing
clusters aimed at constraining the abundance of star-forming galaxies at
z~6-10. Deep near-IR photometry of two lensing clusters (A1835 and AC114) was
obtained with ISAAC/VLT. These images, combined with existing data in the
optical bands, including HST images, were used to select very high redshift
candidates at z>~6 among the optical-dropouts. We have identified 18(8) first
and second-category optical dropouts in A1835 (AC114), detected in more than
one filter up to H(Vega)~23.8 (AB~25.2,uncorrected for lensing). Among them,
8(5) exhibit homogeneous SEDs compatible with star-forming galaxies at z>~6,
and 5(1) are more likely intermediate-redshift EROs based on luminosity
considerations. We have also identified a number of fainter sources in these
fields fulfilling our photometric selection and located around the critical
lines. We use all these data to make a first attempt at constraining the
density of star-forming galaxies present at 6<z<10 using lensing clusters.
Taken at face value, it appears that the number of candidates found seems to be
higher than the one achieved in blank fields with similar photometric depth in
the near-IR. The luminosity function derived for z>6 candidates appears
compatible with that of LBGs at z~3. The turnover observed by Bouwens et al.
(2005) towards the bright end relative to the z~3 LF is not observed in this
sample. Also the upper limit for the UV SFR density at z~6-10 is compatible
with the usual values derived at z~5-6, but higher than the estimates obtained
in the NICMOS Ultra Deep Field (UDF). Increasing the number of blank and
lensing fields with ultra-deep near-IR photometry is essential to get more
accurate constraints on the abundance of z>6 galaxies.",2006-06-06T22:38:27Z
Intergalactic medium heating by dark matter,"We derive the evolution of the energy deposition in the intergalactic medium
(IGM) by dark matter (DM) decays/annihilations for both sterile neutrinos and
light dark matter (LDM) particles. At z > 200 sterile neutrinos transfer a
fraction f_abs~0.5 of their rest mass energy into the IGM; at lower redshifts
this fraction becomes <~ 0.3 depending on the particle mass. The LDM particles
can decay or annihilate. In both cases f_abs~0.4-0.9 at high (> 300) redshift,
dropping to ~0.1 below z=100. These results indicate that the impact of DM
decays/annihilations on the IGM thermal and ionization history is less
important than previously thought. We find that sterile neutrinos (LDM) decays
are able to increase the IGM temperature by z=5 at most up to 4K (100K), about
50-200 times less than predicted by estimates based on the assumption of
complete energy transfer to the gas.",2006-06-20T14:14:11Z
"Consistency between deep crustal heating of strange stars in
  superbursters and soft X-ray transients","Both superbursters and soft X-ray transients probe the process of deep
crustal heating in compact stars. It was recently shown that the transfer of
matter from crust to core in a strange star can heat the crust and ignite
superbursts provided certain constraints on the strange quark matter equation
of state are fulfilled. We derive corresponding constraints on the equation of
state for soft X-ray transients assuming their quiescent emission is powered in
the same way, and further discuss the time dependence of this heating mechanism
in transient systems. We approach this using a simple parametrized model for
deep crustal heating in strange stars assuming slow neutrino cooling in the
core and blackbody photon emission from the surface.The constraints derived for
hot frequently accreting soft X-ray transients are always consistent with those
for superbursters. The colder sources are consistent for low values of the
quark matter binding energy, heat conductivity and neutrino emissivity. The
heating mechanism is very time dependent which may help to explain cold sources
with long recurrence times. Thus deep crustal heating in strange stars can
provide a consistent explanation for superbursters and soft X-ray transients.",2006-03-21T12:48:12Z
"Removing the Microlensing Blending-Parallax Degeneracy Using Source
  Variability","Microlensing event MACHO 97-SMC-1 is one of the rare microlensing events for
which the source is a variable star, simply because most variable stars are
systematically eliminated from microlensing studies. Using observational data
for this event, we show that the intrinsic variability of a microlensed star is
a powerful tool to constrain the nature of the lens by breaking the degeneracy
between the microlens parallax and the blended light. We also present a
statistical test for discriminating the location of the lens based on the
\chi^2 contours of the vector \Lambda, the inverse of the projected velocity.
We find that while SMC self lensing is somewhat favored over halo lensing,
neither location can be ruled out with good confidence.",2006-04-07T17:12:09Z
Local Group surveys for Planetary Nebulae,"The Local Group (LG) represents the best environment to study in detail the
PN population in a large number of morphological types of galaxies. The
closeness of the LG galaxies allows to investigate the faintest side of the PN
luminosity function and to detect PNe also in the less luminous galaxies, the
dwarf galaxies, where a small number of them is expected.
  A review of the results of the most recent imaging surveys in the LG is
presented. Some applications of the surveys for PNe to the study of the star
formation history of the host galaxies are analyzed. In addition, these new
observational data are an invaluable resource for follow-up spectroscopy to
derive the chemical properties of not only PNe, but also other important
emission-line sources like HII regions. These are fundamental tools for the
discussion of the chemical evolution of the host galaxies, mapping the history
of their chemical enrichment at different epochs. The latest results on this
subject are presented.",2006-05-09T09:55:29Z
"Gravity-mode pulsations in subdwarf B stars: a critical test of stellar
  opacity","The identification of non-radial g-mode oscillations as the cause of
variability in cool subdwarf B stars (PG1716 variables) has been frustrated by
a 5 000 K discrepancy between the observed and theoretical blue edge of the
instability domain (Fontaine et al. 2003). A major component in the solution to
this problem has been identified} by (a) using updated OP instead of OPAL
opacities and (b) considering an enhancement of nickel, in addition to that of
iron, in the driving zone. The reason for this success is that, in OP, the
``Fe-bump'' contributions from iron and nickel occur at higher temperatures
than in OPAL. As well as pointing to a solution of an important problem in
stellar pulsation theory, this result provides a critical test for stellar
opacities and the atomic physics used to compute them.",2006-07-21T15:42:53Z
The Cosmological Evolution of the Average Mass Per Baryon,"Subsequent to the early Universe quark-hadron transition the universal baryon
number is carried by nucleons: neutrons and protons. The total number of
nucleons is preserved as the Universe expands, but as it cools lighter protons
are favored over heavier neutrons reducing the average mass per baryon. During
primordial nucleosynthesis free nucleons are transformed into bound nuclides,
primarily helium, and the nuclear binding energies are radiated away, further
reducing the average mass per baryon. In particular, the reduction in the
average mass per baryon resulting from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) modifies
the numerical factor relating the baryon (nucleon) mass and number densities.
Here the average mass per baryon, m_B, is tracked from the early Universe to
the present. The result is used to relate the present ratio of baryons to
photons (by number) to the present baryon mass density at a level of accuracy
commensurate with that of recent cosmological data, as well as to estimate the
energy released during post-BBN stellar nucleosynthesis.",2006-06-08T19:16:41Z
Ultra-Compact H II Regions and the Early Lives of Massive Stars,"We review the phenomenon of ultra-compact H II regions (UCHIIs) as a key
phase in the early lives of massive stars. This most visible manifestation of
massive star formation begins when the Lyman continuum output from the massive
young stellar object becomes sufficient to ionize the surroundings from which
it was born. Knowledge of this environment is gained through an understanding
of the morphologies of UCHII regions and we examine the latest developments in
deep radio and mid-IR imaging. SPITZER data from the GLIMPSE survey are an
important new resource in which PAH emission and the ionizing stars can be
seen. We review the role played by strong stellar winds from the central stars
in sweeping out central cavities and causing the limb-brightened appearance. A
range of evidence from velocity structure, proper motions, the molecular
environment and recent hydrodynamical modeling indicates that cometary UCHII
regions require a combination of champagne flow and bow shock motion. Finally,
we discuss the class of hyper-compact H II regions or broad recombination line
objects. They are likely to mark the transition soon after the breakout of the
Lyman continuum radiation from the young star. Models for these objects are
presented, including photo-evaporating disks and ionized accretion flows that
are gravitationally trapped. Evolutionary scenarios tracing young massive stars
passage through these ionized phases are discussed.",2006-03-21T11:08:22Z
"Shaping bipolar Planetary Nebulae : How mass loss leads to waistline
  development","Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars generally have spherically symmetric
envelopes, whereas most post-AGB stars and Planetary Nebulae (PNe) show
axisymmetric circumstellar envelopes. While various mechanisms for axisymmetric
circumstellar structures may explain the shapes of PNe, they do not address how
the shape of the circumstellar shell evolves. Here we address the temporal
changes in the axisymmetry of AGB star envelopes, and in particular the
development of the torus required in the Generalized Interacting Stellar Winds
(GISW) model. Assuming (1) an AGB star rotates with sufficient angular speed at
the start of the AGB phase; and (2) that the rotational angular momentum of the
AGB star is conserved, we demonstrate that some very important observational
features of AGB star axisymmetry evolution can be reproduced. We find that,
compared to the star's increasing luminosity and decreasing effective
temperature, the decreasing mass of the star primarily affects the axisymmetry
of the envelope. When a representative mass loss history is adopted, where most
of the mass is lost near the end of the AGB phase, the envelope's axisymmetry
increases over time, with the strongest increase occurring near the end of the
AGB phase. This may naturally explain why most AGB stars have spherically
symmetric envelopes, while axisymmetry seems common-place in the post-AGB/PNe
phase. The degree of axisymmetry at the end of the AGB phase is found to
increase with increasing main sequence mass, and the onset of axisymmetry
occurs only after the onset of the superwind (SW) phase, in good agreement with
the observations.",2006-07-15T04:31:12Z
Entrainment Mechanisms for Outflows in the L1551 Star-Forming Region,"We present high sensitivity 12/13CO(1-0) molecular line maps covering the
full extent of the parsec scale L1551 molecular outflow, including the
redshifted east-west (EW) flow. We also present 12CO(3-2) data that extends
over a good fraction of the area mapped in the 1-0 transition. We compare the
molecular data to widefield, narrow-band optical emission in H$\alpha$. While
there are multiple outflows in the L1551 cloud, the main outflow is oriented at
50\arcdeg position angle and appears to be driven by embedded source(s) in the
central IRS 5 region. The 3-2 data indicate that there may be molecular
emission associated with the L1551 NE jet, within the redshifted lobe of main
outflow. We have also better defined the previously known EW flow and believe
we have identified its blueshifted counterpart. We further speculate that the
origin of the EW outflow lies near HH 102. We use velocity dependent opacity
correction to estimate the mass and the energy of the outflow. The resulting
mass spectral indices from our analysis, are systematically lower (less steep)
than the power law indices obtained towards other outflows in several recent
studies that use a similar opacity correction method. We show that systematic
errors and biases in the analysis procedures for deriving mass spectra could
result in errors in the determination of the power-law indices. The mass
spectral indices, the morphological appearance of the position-velocity plots
and integrated intensity emission maps of the molecular data, compared with the
optical, suggest that jet-driven bow-shock entrainment is the best explanation
for the driving mechanism of outflows in L1551. The kinetic energy of the
outflows is found to be comparable to the binding energy of the cloud and
sufficient to maintain the turbulence in the L1551 cloud.",2006-06-09T20:02:55Z
The SPITZER IRS view of stellar populations in Virgo early type galaxies,"We have obtained high S/N Spitzer IRS spectra of 17 Virgo early-type galaxies
that lie on the colour-magnitude relation of passively evolving galaxies in the
cluster. To flux calibrate these extended sources we have devised a new
procedure that allows us to obtain the intrinsic spectral energy distribution
and to disentangle resolved and unresolved emission within the same object.
Thirteen objects of the sample (76%) show a pronounced broad silicate feature
(above 10micron) which is spatially extended and likely of stellar origin, in
agreement with model predictions. The other 4 objects (24%) are characterized
by different levels of activity. In NGC 4486 (M87) the line emission and the
broad silicate emission are evidently unresolved and, given also the typical
shape of the continuum, they likely originate in the nuclear torus. NGC 4636
show emission lines superimposed to extended silicate emission (i.e. likely of
stellar origin, pushing the percentage of galaxies with silicate emission to
82%). Finally NGC 4550 and NGC 4435 are characterized by PAH and line emission,
arising from a central unresolved region.",2006-04-04T16:08:37Z
Superhumps: Confronting Theory with Observation,"We review the theory and observations related to the ``superhump'' precession
of eccentric accretion discs in close binary sytems. We agree with earlier
work, although for different reasons, that the discrepancy between observation
and dynamical theory implies that the effect of pressure in the disc cannot be
neglected. We extend earlier work that investigates this effect to include the
correct expression for the radius at which resonant orbits occur. Using
analytic expressions for the accretion disc structure, we derive a relationship
between the period excess and mass-ratio with the pressure effects included.
This is compared to the observed data, recently derived results for detailed
integration of the disc equations and the equivalent empirically derived
relations and used to predict values for the mass ratio based on measured
values of the period excess for 88 systems.",2006-05-31T16:24:31Z
UV Upturn in Elliptical Galaxies: Theory,"The UV upturn is the rising flux with decreasing wavelength between the Lyman
limit and 2500\AA found virtually in all bright spheroidal galaxies. It has
been a mystery ever since it was first detected by the OAO-2 space telescope
(Code & Welch 1979) because such old metal-rich populations were not expected
to contain any substantial number of hot stars. It was confirmed by following
space missions, ANS (de Boer 1982), IUE (Bertola et al. 1982) and HUT (Brown et
al. 1997). The positive correlation between the UV-to-optical colour (i.e., the
strength of the UV upturn) and the Mg2 line strength found by Burstein et al.
(1987) through IUE observations has urged theorists to construct novel
scenarios in which metal-rich ($\gtrsim Z_{\odot}$) old ($\gtrsim$ a few Gyr)
stars become UV bright (Greggio & Renzini 1990; Horch et al. 1992). Also
interesting was to find using HUT that, regardless of the UV strength, the UV
spectral slopes at 1000--2000\AA in the six UV bright galaxies were nearly
identical suggesting a very small range of temperatures of the UV sources in
these galaxies (Brown et al. 1997), which corresponds to $T_{\rm eff} \approx
20,000 \pm 3,000$ K. This, together with other evidence, effectively ruled out
young stars as the main driver of the UV upturn. A good review on the
observational side of the story is given in the next article by Tom Brown, as
well as in the recent articles of Greggio & Renzini (1999) and O'Connell
(1999).",2006-03-17T06:39:35Z
"Accretion Disks around Young Stars: Lifetimes, Disk Locking and
  Variability","We report the findings of a comprehensive study of disk accretion and related
phenomena in four of the nearest young stellar associations spanning 6-30
million years in age, an epoch that may coincide with the late stages of planet
formation. We have obtained ~650 multi-epoch high-resolution optical spectra of
100 low-mass stars that are likely members of the eta Chamaeleontis (~6 Myr),
TW Hydrae (~8 Myr), beta Pictoris (~12 Myr) and Tucanae-Horologium (~30 Myr)
groups. Our data were collected over 12 nights between 2004 December - 2005
July on the Magellan Clay 6.5m telescope. Based on H$\alpha$ line profiles,
along with a variety of other emission lines, we find clear evidence of
on-going accretion in three out of 11 eta Cha stars and two out of 32 TW Hydrae
members. None of the 57 beta Pic or Tuc-Hor members shows measurable signs of
accretion. Together, these results imply significant evolution of the disk
accretion process within the first several Myr of a low-mass star's life. While
a few disks can continue to accrete for up to ~10 Myr, our findings suggest
that disks accreting for beyond that timescale are rather rare. This result
provides an indirect constraint on the timescale for gas dissipation in inner
disks and, in turn, on gas giant planet formation. All accretors in our sample
are slow rotators, whereas non-accretors cover a large range in rotational
velocities. This may hint at rotational braking by disks at ages up to ~8 Myr.
Our multi-epoch spectra confirm that emission-line variability is common even
in somewhat older T Tauri stars, among which accretors tend to show
particularly strong variations. Thus, our results indicate that accretion and
wind activity undergo significant and sustained variations throughout the
lifetime of accretion disks.",2006-05-23T20:04:28Z
"Outgassing of Ordinary Chondritic Material and Some of its Implications
  for the Chemistry of Asteroids, Planets, and Satellites","We used chemical equilibrium calculations to model thermal outgassing of
ordinary chondritic material as a function of temperature, pressure, and bulk
compositions and use our results to discuss outgassing on asteroids and the
early Earth. The calculations include ~1,000 solids and gases of the elements
Al, C, Ca, Cl, Co, Cr, F, Fe, H, K, Mg, Mn, N, Na, Ni, O, P, S, Si, and Ti. The
major outgassed volatiles from ordinary chondritic material are CH4, H2, H2O,
N2, and NH3(the latter at conditions where hydrous minerals form). Contrary to
widely held assumptions, CO is never the major C-bearing gas during ordinary
chondrite metamorphism. The calculated oxygen fugacity (partial pressure) of
ordinary chondritic material is close to that of the quartz-fayalite-iron (QFI)
buffer. Our results are insensitive to variable total pressure, variable
volatile element abundances, and kinetic inhibition of C and N dissolution in
Fe metal. Our results predict that Earth's early atmosphere contained CH4, H2,
H2O, N2, and NH3; similar to that used in Miller-Urey synthesis of organic
compounds.",2006-06-27T22:33:19Z
Cyclic evolution of radio pulsars on the time scale of hundreds of years,"The recent massive measurements of pulsar frequency second derivatives have
shown that they are 100-1000 times larger than expected for standard pulsar
slowdown low. Moreover, the second derivatives as well as braking indices are
even negative for about half of pulsars. We explain these paradoxical results
on the basis of the statistical analysis of the rotational parameters $\nu$,
$\dot \nu$ and $\ddot \nu$ of the subset of 295 pulsars taken mostly from the
ATNF database. We have found strong correlation of $\ddot \nu$ and $\dot \nu$
either for $\ddot\nu > 0$ (correlation coefficient $r\approx0.9$) and $\ddot\nu
< 0$ ($r\approx0.85$), and of $\nu$ and $\dot\nu$ ($r\approx0.7$). We interpret
these dependencies as evolutionary ones due to $\dot\nu$ being nearly
proportional to characteristic age $\tau_{ch}$. The derived statistical
relations as well as ""anomalous"" values of $\ddot\nu$ are well explained in the
framework of the simple model of cyclic evolution of the rotational frequency
of the pulsars. It combines the secular change of $\nu_{tr}(t)$,
$\dot\nu_{tr}(t)$ and $\ddot\nu_{tr}(t)$ according to the power law with
$n\approx5$ and harmonic oscillations of 100--1000 years period with an
amplitude from $10^{-3}$ Hz for young pulsars to $10^{-10}$ Hz for elder ones.
The physical nature of these cyclic variations of the rotational frequency may
be similar to the well-known red timing noise, however, with much larger
characteristic time scale.",2006-03-14T23:24:37Z
"Early ComeOn+ Adaptive Optics Observation of GQ Lup and its Substellar
  Companion","An analysis of adaptive optics K-band imaging data of GQ Lup acquired in 1994
by the first generation adaptive optics system ComeOn+ at the ESO 3.6m optical
telescope in La Silla is presented. The data reveal a likely candidate for the
low-mass companion recently reported in the literature. An a posteriori
detection in the 11 year old data would provide a useful astrometric data point
for the very long period (~1000 yr) orbit of the GQ Lup system. However, the
data is severely contaminated by speckle noise at the given projected
separation, which decreases the confidence of the detection. Still, from the
data we can conclude that GQ Lup B is not an unrelated background source, but
instead a physical companion to GQ Lup A. We present here the reduction and
analysis of the ComeOn+ images, as well as the results. We also discuss the
nature of the companion based on data and models available in the scientific
literature and examine claims made regarding the classification of the object
as a planet.",2006-03-09T10:15:44Z
"Archeops In-flight Performance, Data Processing and Map Making","Archeops is a balloon--borne experiment widely inspired by the Planck
satellite and by its High Frequency Instrument (HFI). It is mainly dedicated to
measure the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature anisotropies at high
angular resolution (about 12 arcminutes) over a large fraction of the sky
(around 30 %) in the millimetre and submillimetre range at 143, 217, 353 and
545 GHz. Further, the Archeops 353 GHz channel consists of three pairs of
polarized sensitive bolometers designed to detect the polarized diffuse
emission of Galactic dust. We present in this paper the update of the
instrumental setup as well as the inflight performance for the last Archeops
flight campaign in February 2002 from Kiruna (Sweden). We also describe the
processing and analysis of the Archeops time ordered data for that campaign
which lead to the measurement of the CMB anisotropies power spectrum in the
multipole range l=10-700 (Benoit et al. 2003a, Tristram et al. 2005) and to the
first measurement of the dust polarized emission at large angular scales and
its polarized. We present maps of 30 % of the sky of the Galactic emission,
including the Galactic plane, in the four Archeops channels at 143, 217, 353
and 545 GHz and maps of the CMB anisotropies at 143 and 217 GHz. These are the
firstever available sub--degree resolution maps in the millimetre and
submillimetre range of the large angular-scales Galactic dust diffuse emission
and CMB temperature anisotropies respectively.",2006-03-24T12:00:50Z
X-ray spectra of sources in the 13H XMM-Newton / Chandra deep field,"We present the X-ray spectra of 86 optically-identified sources in the 13H
XMM-Newton/Chandra deep field which have >70 X-ray counts. The sample consists
of 50 broad line AGN, 25 narrow emission line galaxies, 6 absorption line
galaxies, and 5 Galactic stars. The majority (42/50) of the broad line AGN have
X-ray spectra which are consistent with a power law shape. They have a mean
photon index of Gamma = 2.0 +- 0.1 and an intrinsic dispersion sigma = 0.4 +-
0.1. Five BLAGN show a deficit of soft X-rays, indicating absorption.
Significant absorption is more common in the narrow emission line galaxies
(13/25) and absorption line galaxies (2/6) than in the broad line AGN (5/50),
but is not universal in any of these classes of object. The majority of the 20
absorbed sources have X-ray spectra consistent with a simple cold photoelectric
absorber, but 6/20 require more complex models with either an additional
component of soft X-ray emitting plasma, or an ionised absorber. Of the 16
galaxies which do not show evidence for X-ray absorption, only 2 objects are
likely to be powered by star formation, and both have 2-10 keV X-ray
luminosities of <= 10^40 cgs. The X-ray emission in the other 14 unabsorbed
NELGs and galaxies is most likely powered by AGN, which are not detected in the
optical because they are outshone by their luminous host galaxies. The Galactic
stars show multi-temperature thermal spectra which peak between 0.5 and 1 keV.
Star/AGN discrimination is possible for 4 of the 5 stars solely from their
X-ray spectra.",2006-04-02T19:56:25Z
"Global structures in a composite system of two scale-free discs with a
  coplanar magnetic field","We investigate a theoretical MHD disc problem involving a composite disc
system of gravitationally coupled stellar and gaseous discs with a coplanar
magnetic field in the presence of an axisymmetric dark matter halo. The two
discs are expediently approximated as razor-thin, a ring-like magnetic field,
and a power-law rotation curve in radius . By imposing the scale-free
condition, we construct analytically stationary global MHD perturbation
configurations for both aligned and logarithmic spiral patterns. MHD
perturbation configurations in a composite system of partial discs in the
presence of an axisymmetric dark matter halo are also considered. We derive
analytically the stationary MHD dispersion relations for both aligned and
unaligned perturbation structures and analyze the corresponding phase
relationships between surface mass densities and the magnetic field. Compared
with earlier results, we obtain three solution branches corresponding to super
fast MHD density waves, fast MHD density waves and slow MHD density waves,
respectively. By evaluating the unaligned $m=0$ case, we determine the marginal
stability curves where the two unstable regimes corresponding to Jeans collapse
instability and ring fragmentation instability are identified. We find that the
aligned $m=0$ case is simply the limit of the unaligned $m=0$ case with the
radial wavenumber $\xi\to0$. We further show that a composite system of partial
discs behaves much differently from a composite system of full discs in certain
aspects. Our formalism provides a useful theoretical framework in the study of
stationary global perturbation configurations for MHD disc galaxies with bars,
spirals and barred spirals.",2006-07-14T10:28:37Z
On the dynamical evolution of hot spots in powerful radio loud AGNs,"We describe the dynamical evolution of hot spots velocity, pressure and mass
density in radio loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs), taking proper account of
(1) the conservations of the mass, momentum, and kinetic energy flux of the
unshocked jet, (2) the deceleration process of the jet by shocks, and (3) the
cocoon expansion without assuming the constant aspect ratio of the cocoon. By
the detailed comparison with two dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic
simulations, we show that our model well reproduces the whole evolution of
relativistic jets. Our model can explain also the observational trends of the
velocity, the pressure, the size, and mass density of hot spots in compact
symmetric objects (CSOs) and FR II radio galaxies.",2006-05-19T06:20:13Z
Accelerated expansion from structure formation,"We discuss the physics of backreaction-driven accelerated expansion. Using
the exact equations for the behaviour of averages in dust universes, we explain
how large-scale smoothness does not imply that the effect of inhomogeneity and
anisotropy on the expansion rate is small. We demonstrate with an analytical
toy model how gravitational collapse can lead to acceleration. We find that the
conjecture of the accelerated expansion being due to structure formation is in
agreement with the general observational picture of structures in the universe,
and more quantitative work is needed to make a detailed comparison.",2006-07-27T19:11:18Z

Galaxy Luminosities in 2PIGG groups,"We derive composite luminosity functions (LF) for galaxies in groups and
examine the behaviour of the LF as a function of group luminosity (used as an
indicator of group or halo mass). We consider both the entire galaxy population
and split galaxies into red and blue (quiescent and star forming) samples, in
order to examine possible mechanisms behind observed variations of galaxy
properties with environment. We find evidence that $M^*$ brightens and $\alpha$
steepens with group luminosity, until a threshold value where the LF parameters
stabilize at those found in rich clusters. The effect is seen in the total LF
and for the blue and red galaxies separately. The behaviour of the quiescent
and star-forming samples is qualitatively consistent with variations resulting
from interactions and mergers, where mergers build the bright end of the
luminosity function at the same time as dwarf irregulars have their star
formation quenched and evolve into dwarf ellipticals. These processes appear to
take place preferentially in low luminosity groups and to be complete at a
group luminosity of -22.5 in $B$, corresponding to a halo mass of order
$10^{13.5} M_{\odot}$.",2006-08-01T18:38:10Z
"Improving Cosmological Distance Measurements by Reconstruction of the
  Baryon Acoustic Peak","The baryon acoustic oscillations are a promising route to the precision
measure of the cosmological distance scale and hence the measurement of the
time evolution of dark energy. We show that the non-linear degradation of the
acoustic signature in the correlations of low-redshift galaxies is a
correctable process. By suitable reconstruction of the linear density field,
one can sharpen the acoustic peak in the correlation function or, equivalently,
restore the higher harmonics of the oscillations in the power spectrum. With
this, one can achieve better measurements of the acoustic scale for a given
survey volume. Reconstruction is particularly effective at low redshift, where
the non-linearities are worse but where the dark energy density is highest. At
z=0.3, we find that one can reduce the sample variance error bar on the
acoustic scale by at least a factor of 2 and in principle by nearly a factor of
4. We discuss the significant implications our results have for the design of
galaxy surveys aimed at measuring the distance scale through the acoustic peak.",2006-04-17T21:46:29Z
Long-term Variability in the Length of the Solar Cycle,"Detailed models of the solar cycle require information about the starting
time and rise time as well as the shape and amplitude of the cycle. However,
none of these models includes a discussion of the variations in the length of
the cycle, which has been known to vary from $\sim$7 to 17 years. The focus of
our study was to investigate whether this range was associated with a secular
pattern in the length of the sunspot cycle. To provide a basis for the analysis
of the long-term behavior of the Sun, we analyzed archival data of sunspot
numbers from 1700 - 2005 and sunspot areas from 1874 - 2005. The independent
techniques of power spectrum analysis and phase dispersion minimization were
used to confirm the $\sim$11-year Schwabe Cycle, and to illustrate the large
range in the length of this cycle. Long-term cycles were identified in archival
data from 1610 -- 2000 using median trace analyses of the length of the cycle,
and from power spectrum analyses of the (O-C) residuals of the dates of sunspot
minima and maxima. The median trace analysis suggested that the cycle length
had a period of 183 - 243 years, while the more precise power spectrum analysis
identified a period of 188 $\pm$ 38 years. We found that the 188-year cycle was
consistent with the variation of sunspot numbers and seems to be related to the
Schwabe Cycle. We found a correlation between the times of historic minima and
the length of the sunspot cycle such that the length of the cycle was usually
highest when the actual number of sunspots was lowest. The cycle length was
growing during the Maunder Minimum when there were almost no sunspots visible
on the Sun. This information can now be used to improve the accuracy of the
current solar cycle models, to better predict the starting time of a given
cycle.",2006-06-17T21:22:55Z
"Features in Dark Energy Equation of State and Modulations in the Hubble
  Diagram","We probe the time dependence of the dark energy equation of state (EOS) in
light of three-year WMAP (WMAP3) and the combination with other tentative
cosmological observations from galaxy clustering (SDSS) and Type Ia Supernova
(SNIa). We mainly focus on cases where the EOS is oscillating or with local
bumps. By performing a global analysis with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
method, we find the current observations, in particular the WMAP3 + SDSS data
combination, allow large oscillations of the EOS which can leave oscillating
features on the (residual) Hubble diagram, and such oscillations are
potentially detectable by future observations like SNAP, or even by the
CURRENTLY ONGOING SNIa observations. Local bumps of dark energy EOS can also
leave imprints on CMB, LSS and SNIa. In cases where the bumps take place at low
redshifts and the effective EOS are close to -1, CMB and LSS observations
cannot give constraints on such possibilities. However, geometrical
observations like (future) SNIa can possibly detect such features. On the other
hand when the local bumps take place at higher redshifts beyond the
detectability of SNIa, future precise observations like Gamma-ray bursts, CMB
and LSS may possibly detect such features. In particular, we find that
bump-like dark energy EOS on high redshifts might be responsible for the
features of WMAP on ranges l \sim 30-50, which is interesting and deserves
addressing further.",2006-05-15T17:42:09Z
"Detection of Wolf-Rayet stars in host galaxies of Gamma-Ray Bursts
  (GRBs): are GRBs produced by runaway massive stars ejected from high stellar
  density regions ?","We have obtained deep spectroscopic observations of several nearby gamma-ray
burst (GRB) host galaxies revealing for the first time the presence of
Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars and numerous O stars located in rich and compact clusters
or star forming regions. Surprisingly, high spatial resolution imaging shows
that the GRBs and the associated supernovae did not occur in these regions, but
several hundreds of parsec away. Considering various scenarios for GRB
progenitors, we do not find any simple explanation of why they should be
preferentially born in regions with low stellar densities. All the examined
GRBs and associated SNe have occurred 400 to 800 pc from very high density
stellar environments including large numbers of WR stars. Such distances can be
travelled through at velocities of 100 km/s or larger, assuming the travel time
to be the typical life time of WR stars. It leads us to suggest that GRB
progenitors may be runaway massive stars ejected from compact massive star
clusters. The ejection from such super star clusters may lead to a spin-up of
these stars, producing the loss of the hydrogen and/or helium envelopes leading
to the origin of the type Ibc supernovae associated with GRBs. If this scenario
applies tocd text/Sc all GRBs, it provides a natural explanation of the very
small fraction of massive stars that emit a GRB at the end of their life. An
alternative to this scenario could be a binary origin for GRBs, but this still
requires an explanation of why it would preferentially occur in low stellar
density regions.",2006-04-21T09:25:49Z

A Hot DQ White Dwarf in the Open Star Cluster M35,"We report the discovery of a hot DQ white dwarf, NGC 2168:LAWDS 28, that is a
likely member of the 150-Myr old cluster NGC 2168 (Messier 35). The spectrum of
the white dwarf is dominated by CII features. The effective temperature is
difficult to estimate but likely > 20,000 K based on the temperatures of hot
DQs with similar spectra. NGC2168:LAWDS 28 provides further evidence that hot
DQs may be the ``missing'' high-mass helium-atmosphere white dwarfs. Based on
published studies, we find that the DBA WD LP 475-242 is likely a member of the
Hyades open cluster, as often assumed. These two white dwarfs are the entire
sample of known He-atmosphere white dwarfs in open clusters with turnoff masses
>2 solar masses. Based on the number of known cluster DA white dwarfs and a
redetermination of the H-atmosphere:He-atmosphere ratio, commonly known as the
DA:DB ratio, we re-examine the hypothesis that the H- to He-atmosphere ratio in
open clusters is the same as the ratio in the field. Under this hypothesis, we
calculate that five He-atmosphere WDs are expected to have been discovered,
with a probability of finding fewer than three He-atmosphere white dwarfs of
0.08, or at the ~ 2-sigma level.",2006-04-20T00:15:49Z
"Bisectors of the cross-correlation function applied to stellar spectra.
  Discriminating stellar activity, oscillations and planets","Aims: We investigate whether bisectors derived from cross-correlation
functions (CCF) of single-exposure spectra can be used to provide information
on stellar atmospheres, and whether they can be used to discriminate between
radial velocity changes caused by planets, magnetic activity and oscillations.
  Methods: Using a sample of bright stars observed with the HARPS spectrograph,
we examine the shapes of the bisectors of individual strong spectral lines in
summed spectra, comparing with similar studies in the literature. Moreover, we
examine four different quantitative CCF bisector measures for correlations with
radial velocity and stellar parameters.
  Results: We show that CCF bisector measures can be used for quantitative
analysis, employing both the absolute values and the variations. From absolute
values, log g and absolute magnitude can be approximated, and from the
correlations with radial velocity one can distinguish between magnetic
activity, oscillations and orbiting planets as the probable cause of radial
velocity variations. We confirm that different isolated spectral lines show
different bisector shapes, even between lines of the same element, calling for
caution in trying to derive global stellar properties from the bisector of a
CCF. For the active star HR 1362 we suggest from the bisector shape an extra
photospheric heating caused by the chromosphere of several hundred degrees. We
confirm the fill-in of spectral lines of the Sun taken on the daylight sky
caused by Rayleigh-Brillouin and aerosol scattering, and we show for the first
time that the fill-in has an asymmetric component.",2006-04-11T14:13:44Z
The Spin of the Near-Extreme Kerr Black Hole GRS 1915+105,"Based on a spectral analysis of the X-ray continuum that employs a fully
relativistic accretion-disk model, we conclude that the compact primary of the
binary X-ray source GRS 1915+105 is a rapidly-rotating Kerr black hole. We find
a lower limit on the dimensionless spin parameter of a* greater than 0.98. Our
result is robust in the sense that it is independent of the details of the data
analysis and insensitive to the uncertainties in the mass and distance of the
black hole. Furthermore, our accretion-disk model includes an advanced
treatment of spectral hardening. Our data selection relies on a rigorous and
quantitative definition of the thermal state of black hole binaries, which we
used to screen all of the available RXTE and ASCA data for the thermal state of
GRS 1915+105. In addition, we focus on those data for which the accretion disk
luminosity is less than 30% of the Eddington luminosity. We argue that these
low-luminosity data are most appropriate for the thin alpha-disk model that we
employ. We assume that there is zero torque at the inner edge of the disk, as
is likely when the disk is thin, although we show that the presence of a
significant torque does not affect our results. Our model and the model of the
relativistic jets observed for this source constrain the distance and black
hole mass and could thus be tested by determining a VLBA parallax distance and
improving the measurement of the mass function. Finally, we comment on the
significance of our results for relativistic-jet and core-collapse models, and
for the detection of gravitational waves.",2006-06-04T20:47:22Z
"A Prominent Accretion Disk in the Low-Hard State of the Black Hole
  Candidate SWIFT J1753.5-0127","We report on simultaneous XMM-Newton and RXTE observations of the
stellar-mass black hole candidate SWIFT J1753.5-0127. The source was observed
in the low-hard state, during the decline of a hard outburst. The inner
accretion disk is commonly assumed to be radially truncated in the low-hard
state, and it has been suggested that this property may be tied the production
of steady, compact jets. Fits to the X-ray spectra of SWIFT J1753.5-0127 with a
number of simple models clearly reveal a cool (kT ~ 0.2 keV) accretion disk.
The disk component is required at more than the 8 sigma level of confidence.
Although estimates of inner disk radii based on continuum spectroscopy are
subject to considerable uncertainty, fits with a number of models suggest that
the disk is observed at or close to the innermost stable circular orbit.
Recently, an observation of GX 339-4 revealed a disk extending to the innermost
stable circular orbit at L_X/L_Edd ~ 0.05; our results from SWIFT J1753.5-0127
may extend this finding down to L_X/L_Edd ~ 0.003 (d/8.5 kpc)^2 (M/Msun). We
discuss our results within the context of low-luminosity accretion flow models
and disk-jet connections.",2006-05-08T01:59:05Z
The K-band properties of Seyfert 2 galaxies,"It is well known that the [O {\sc iii}]$\lambda$5007 emission line and hard
X-ray(2-10keV) luminosities are good indicators of AGN activities and that the
near and mid-infrared emission of AGN originates from re-radiation of dusty
clouds heated by the UV/optical radiation from the accretion disk. In this
paper we present a study of the near-infrared K-band (2.2$\mu$m) properties for
a sample of 65 Seyfert 2 galaxies. By using the AGN/Bulge/Disk decomposition
technique, we analyzed the 2MASS K$_{\rm S}$-band images for Seyfert 2 galaxies
in order to derive the K$_{\rm S}$- band magnitudes for the central engine,
bulge, and disk components. We find that the K$_{\rm S}$-band magnitudes of the
central AGN component in Seyfert 2 galaxies are tightly correlated with the [O
{\sc iii}]$\lambda$5007 and the hard X-ray luminosities, which suggests that
the AGN K-band emission is also an excellent indicator of the nuclear
activities at least for Seyfert 2 galaxies. We also confirm the good relation
between the central black hole masses and bulge's K-band magnitudes for Seyfert
2s.",2006-03-31T15:32:57Z
Swift observations of GRB050712,"We present the results of X-ray and optical observations of GRB050712
performed by Swift. The X-ray lightcurve of this burst exhibits episodes of
flares in the first 1000s, the same epoch at which the UVOT detected an optical
counterpart. A shallow X-ray decay, with a decay slope of -0.73, followed and
lasted ~70ks. This behaviour can be explained in terms of activity of GRB
'inner engine', with the possibility of that the last flare is caused by the
interaction of the ejecta with the surrounding medium. We also find interesting
spectral parameters for the X-ray emission. In particular, data suggest the
presence of an intrinsic absorption in the first 1000s, which can be explained
if circumbust medium clouds lie along the line of sight.",2006-05-04T18:10:02Z
"New mechanism of generation of large-scale magnetic fields in merging
  protogalactic and protostellar clouds","A new mechanism of generation of large-scale magnetic fields in colliding
protogalactic clouds and merging protostellar clouds is discussed. Interaction
of the colliding clouds produces large-scale shear motions which are
superimposed on small-scale turbulence. Generation of the large-scale magnetic
field is due to a ''shear-current"" effect (or ""vorticity-current"" effect), and
the mean vorticity is caused by the large-scale shear motions of colliding
clouds. This effect causes the generation of the mean magnetic field even in a
nonrotating and nonhelical homogeneous turbulence. There is no quenching of the
nonlinear shear-current effect contrary to the quenching of the nonlinear alpha
effect, the nonlinear turbulent magnetic diffusion, etc. During the nonlinear
growth of the mean magnetic field, the shear-current effect only changes its
sign at some value of the mean magnetic field which determines the level of the
saturated mean magnetic field. Numerical study shows that the saturated level
of the mean magnetic field is of the order of the equipartition field
determined by the turbulent kinetic energy. The estimated large-scale magnetic
field for merging protogalactic clouds is about several microgauss, and for
merging protostellar clouds is of the order of several tenth of microgauss.",2006-04-07T15:56:53Z
"High-Resolution Spectroscopy in Tr37: Gas Accretion Evolution in Evolved
  Dusty Disks","Using the Hectochelle multifiber spectrograph, we have obtained
high-resolution (R~34,000) spectra in the Halpha region for a large number of
stars in the 4 Myr-old cluster Tr 37, containing 146 previously known members
and 26 newly identified ones. We present the Halpha line profiles of all
members, compare them to our IR observations of dusty disks (2MASS/JHK + IRAC +
MIPS 24 micron), use the radial velocities as a membership criterion, and
calculate the rotational velocities. We find a good correlation between the
accretion-broadened profiles and the presence of protoplanetary disks, noting
that a small fraction of the accreting stars presents broad profiles with
Halpha equivalent widths smaller than the canonical limit separating CTTS and
WTTS. The number of strong accretors appears to be lower than in younger
regions, and a large number of CTTS have very small accretion rates
(dM/dt<10^{-9} Msun/yr). Taking into account that the spectral energy
distributions are consistent with dust evolution (grain growth/settling) in the
innermost disk, this suggests a parallel evolution of the dusty and gaseous
components. We also observe that about half of the ""transition objects"" (stars
with no IR excesses at wavelengths shorter than ~6 micron) do not show any
signs of active accretion, whereas the other half is accreting with accretion
rates <10^{-9} Msun/yr. These zero or very low accretion rates reveal important
gas evolution and/or gas depletion in the innermost disk, which could be
related to grain growth up to planetesimal or even planet sizes. Finally, we
examine the rotational velocities of accreting and non accreting stars, finding
no significant differences that could indicate disk locking at these ages.",2006-07-24T06:10:14Z
"On the luminosity-redshift relation in brane-worlds with cosmological
  constant","In this paper we calculate the luminosity distance - redshift relation for a
special type of flat Friedmann brane with cosmological constant. This special
case is singled out by its simplicity, the luminosity distance being given in
terms of elementary functions. We compare our analytical result with the
expresssion of the luminosity distance for the flat
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe and discuss the
differences.",2006-06-27T18:20:40Z
"Panchromatic Properties of 99,000 Galaxies Detected by SDSS, and (some
  by) ROSAT, GALEX, 2MASS, IRAS, GB6, FIRST, NVSS and WENSS Surveys","We discuss the panchromatic properties of 99,088 galaxies selected from the
SDSS Data Release 1 spectroscopic sample (a flux-limited sample for 1360
deg^2). These galaxies are positionally matched to sources detected by ROSAT,
GALEX, 2MASS, IRAS, GB6, FIRST, NVSS and WENSS. We find strong correlations
between the detection fraction at other wavelengths and optical properties such
as flux, colors, and emission-line strengths. Using GALEX, SDSS, and 2MASS
data, we construct the UV-IR broad-band spectral energy distributions for
various types of galaxies, and find that they form a nearly one-parameter
family. For example, based on SDSS u- and r-band data, supplemented with
redshift, the K-band 2MASS magnitudes can be ""predicted"" with an rms scatter of
only 0.2 mag. When a dust content estimate determined from SDSS data by
Kauffmann et al. (2003) is also utilized, this scatter decreases to 0.1 mag. We
demonstrate that this dust content is indeed higher for galaxies detected by
IRAS and that it can be used to ""predict"" measured IRAS 60 micron flux density
within a factor of two using only SDSS data. We also show that the position of
a galaxy in the emission-line-based Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagram is
correlated with the optical light concentration index and u-r color determined
from the SDSS broad-band imaging data, and discuss changes in the morphology of
this diagram induced by requiring detections at other wavelengths. We study the
IR-radio correlation and find evidence that its slope may be different for AGN
and star-forming galaxies and related to the H_alpha/H_beta line strength
ratio.",2006-06-14T17:47:34Z
Near Scale Invariance with Modified Dispersion Relations,"We describe a novel mechanism to seed a nearly scale invariant spectrum of
adiabatic perturbations during a non-inflationary stage. It relies on a
modified dispersion relation that contains higher powers of the spatial
momentum of matter perturbations. We implement this idea in the context of a
massless scalar field in an otherwise perfectly homogeneous universe. The
couplings of the field to background scalars and tensors give rise to the
required modification of its dispersion relation, and the couplings of the
scalar to matter result in an adiabatic primordial spectrum. This work is meant
to explicitly illustrate that it is possible to seed nearly scale invariant
primordial spectra without inflation, within a conventional expansion history.",2006-06-07T19:53:38Z
"No Expanding Fireball: Resolving the Recurrent Nova RS Ophiuchi with
  Infrared Interferometry","Following the recent outburst of the recurrent nova RS Oph on 2006 Feb 12, we
measured its near-infrared size using the IOTA, Keck, and PTI Interferometers
at multiple epochs. The characteristic size of ~3 milliarcseconds hardly
changed over the first 60 days of the outburst, ruling out currently-popular
models whereby the near-infrared emission arises from hot gas in the expanding
shock. The emission was also found to be significantly asymmetric, evidenced by
non-zero closure phases detected by IOTA. The physical interpretation of these
data depend strongly on the adopted distance to RS Oph. Our data can be
interpreted as the first direct detection of the underlying RS Oph binary,
lending support to the recent ``reborn red giant'' models of Hachisu & Kato.
However, this result hinges on an RS Oph distance of ~< 540 pc, in strong
disagreement with the widely-adopted distance of ~1.6 kpc. At the farther
distance, our observations imply instead the existence of a non-expanding,
dense and ionized circumbinary gaseous disk or reservoir responsible for the
bulk of the near-infrared emission. Longer-baseline infrared interferometry is
uniquely suited to distinguish between these models and to ultimately determine
the distance, binary orbit, and component masses for RS Oph, one of the
closest-known (candidate) SNIa progenitor systems.",2006-07-17T21:21:53Z
Phantom Dark Energy Models with Negative Kinetic Term,"We examine phantom dark energy models derived from a scalar field with a
negative kinetic term for which V(phi) approaches infinity asymptotically. All
such models can be divided into three classes, corresponding to an equation of
state parameter w with asymptotic behavior w -> -1, w -> w_0 < -1, and w ->
infinity. We derive the conditions on the potential V(phi) which lead to each
of these three types of behavior. For models with w -> -1, we derive the
conditions on V(phi) which determine whether or not such models produce a
future big rip. Observational constraints are derived on two classes of these
models: power-law potentials with V(phi) = lambda phi^alpha (with alpha
positive or negative) and exponential potentials of the form V(phi) = beta
e^{lambda phi^alpha}. It is shown that these models spend more time in a state
with Omega_m ~ Omega_phi than do corresponding models with a constant value of
w, thus providing a more satisfactory solution to the coincidence problem.",2006-06-29T19:28:10Z
"Thermal evolution of rotating strange stars in color superconductivity
  phase","Under the combination effect of the recommencement heating due to spin-down
of strange stars and the heat perseveration due to weak conduct heat of the
crust, the Cooper pair breaking and formation(PBF) in color superconduction
quark matter arises. We investigated the cooling of the strange stars with a
crust in color superconductivity phase including both decomfinement heating and
PBF process. We find that deconfinement heating can delay the thermal evolution
of strange stars and the PBF process suppresses the early temperature rise of
the stars. The cooling strange stars behave within the brightness constraint of
young compact objects when the color superconductivity gap is small enough.",2006-07-04T09:01:55Z
Refining the fundamental plane of accreting black holes,"The idea of a unified description of supermassive and stellar black holes has
been supported by the extension of the empirical radio/X-ray correlation from
X-ray binaries to active galactic nuclei through the inclusion of a mass term.
This has lead to the so-called fundamental plane of black hole activity in the
black hole mass, radio and X-ray luminosity space. Two incarnations of this
fundamental plane have so far been suggested using different underlying models
and using two different samples of accreting black holes. We present revised
samples for both studies together with a refined statistical analysis using
measured errors of the observables. This method is used to compare the two
samples, discuss selection effects, and infer parameters for the fundamental
plane in a homogeneous way. We show that strongly sub-Eddington objects in a
state equivalent to the low/hard state of X-ray binaries follow the fundamental
plane very tightly; the scatter is comparable to the measurement errors.
However, we find that the estimated parameters depend strongly on the
assumptions made on the sources of scatter and the relative weight of the
different AGN classes in the sample. Using only hard state objects, the
fundamental plane is in agreement with the prediction of a simple uncooled
synchrotron/jet model for the emitted radiation. Inclusion of high-state
objects increases the scatter and moves the correlation closer to a disk/jet
model. This is qualitatively consistent with a picture where low-state objects
are largely dominated by jet emission while high-state objects have a strong
contribution from an accretion disk.",2006-03-05T16:44:16Z
How accurate are the time delay estimates in gravitational lensing?,"We present a novel approach to estimate the time delay between light curves
of multiple images in a gravitationally lensed system, based on Kernel methods
in the context of machine learning. We perform various experiments with
artificially generated irregularly-sampled data sets to study the effect of the
various levels of noise and the presence of gaps of various size in the
monitoring data. We compare the performance of our method with various other
popular methods of estimating the time delay and conclude, from experiments
with artificial data, that our method is least vulnerable to missing data and
irregular sampling, within reasonable bounds of Gaussian noise. Thereafter, we
use our method to determine the time delays between the two images of quasar
Q0957+561 from radio monitoring data at 4 cm and 6 cm, and conclude that if
only the observations at epochs common to both wavelengths are used, the time
delay gives consistent estimates, which can be combined to yield 408\pm 12
days. The full 6 cm dataset, which covers a longer monitoring period, yields a
value which is 10% larger, but this can be attributed to differences in
sampling and missing data.",2006-05-01T20:42:03Z
On the evolution of the resonant planetary system HD128311,"A significant number of the known multiple exoplanetary systems are
containing a pair of giant planets engaged in a low order mean motion
resonance. Such a resonant condition protects the dynamics of these planets
resulting in very stable orbits. According to recent studies the capture into a
resonance is the result of a planetary migration process induced by the
interaction of the planets with a protoplanetary disk. If the migration is slow
enough (adiabatic) next to a mean motion resonance, the two planets will also
be in apsidal corotation.
  The recently refined orbital parameters of the system HD 128311 suggest that
the two giant planets are in a 2:1 mean motion resonance, however without
exhibiting apsidal corotation. Thus the evolution of this system can not be
described by an adiabatic migration process alone.
  We present possible evolution scenarios of this system combining migration
processes and sudden perturbations. We model migration scenarios through
numerical integration of the gravitational N-body problem with additional
non-conservative forces. Planet-planet scattering has been investigated by
N-body simulations.
  We show that the present dynamical state of the system HD128311 may be
explained by such evolutionary processes.",2006-03-24T11:12:01Z
Kinematics of the ultra-compact helium accretor AM Canum Venaticorum,"We report on the results from a five-night campaign of high-speed
spectroscopy of the 17-minute binary AM Canum Venaticorum, obtained with the
4.2-m William Herschel Telescope on La Palma.
  We derive a mass ratio q=0.18+/-0.01 for AM CVn, which is significantly
higher than the value found in previous, less direct measurements. We discuss
the implications for AM CVn's evolutionary history and show that a helium star
progenitor scenario is strongly favoured. We further discuss the implications
for the interpretation of AM CVn's superhump behaviour, and for the
detectability of its gravitational-wave signal with LISA.
  Finally, we test the predictions of an eccentric, precessing disc that are
based on AM CVn's observed superhump behaviour. We limit the effective
eccentricity in the outermost part of the disc, where the resonances that drive
the eccentricity are thought to occur, to e=0.04+/-0.01, which is smaller than
previous models indicated.",2006-06-13T19:56:14Z
"Arcfinder: An algorithm for the automatic detection of gravitational
  arcs","We present an efficient algorithm designed for and capable of detecting
elongated, thin features such as lines and curves in astronomical images, and
its application to the automatic detection of gravitational arcs. The algorithm
is sufficiently robust to detect such features even if their surface brightness
is near the pixel noise in the image, yet the amount of spurious detections is
low. The algorithm subdivides the image into a grid of overlapping cells which
are iteratively shifted towards a local centre of brightness in their immediate
neighbourhood. It then computes the ellipticity for each cell, and combines
cells with correlated ellipticities into objects. These are combined to graphs
in a next step, which are then further processed to determine properties of the
detected objects. We demonstrate the operation and the efficiency of the
algorithm applying it to HST images of galaxy clusters known to contain
gravitational arcs. The algorithm completes the analysis of an image with
3000x3000 pixels in about 4 seconds on an ordinary desktop PC. We discuss
further applications, the method's remaining problems and possible approaches
to their solution.",2006-07-24T19:09:07Z
"Accurate M Dwarf Metallicities from Spectral Synthesis: A Critical Test
  of Model Atmospheres","We describe a method for accurately determining M dwarf metallicities with
spectral synthesis based on abundance analyses of visual binary stars. We
obtained high resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of each component of
five visual binary pairs at McDonald Observatory. The spectral types of the
components range from F7 to K3 V for the primaries and M0.5 to M3.5 V for the
secondaries. We have determined the metallicities of the primaries
differentially with respect to the Sun by fitting synthetic spectra to Fe
\textsc{i} line profiles in the observed spectra. In the course of our analysis
of the M dwarf secondaries we have made significant improvements to the PHOENIX
cool-star model atmospheres and the spectrum analysis code MOOG. Our analysis
yields a RMS deviation of 0.11 dex in metallicity values between the binary
pairs. We estimate the uncertainties in the derived stellar parameters for the
M dwarfs to be 48 K, 0.10 dex, 0.12 dex, 0.15 km s$^{-1}$, and 0.20 km s$^{-1}$
for {T}$_{eff}$, log \textsl{g}, [M/H], $\xi$, and $\eta$ respectively.
Accurate stellar evolutionary models are needed to progress further in the
analysis of cool-star spectra; the new model atmospheres warrant recalculation
of the evolutionary models.",2006-08-03T21:48:10Z
"New southern blue compact dwarf galaxies in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift
  Survey","Aiming to find new extremely metal-deficient star-forming galaxies we
extracted from the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) 100K Data
Release 14 emission-line galaxies with relatively strong [OIII] 4363 emission.
Spectroscopic and photometric studies of this sample and, in addition, of 7
Tololo and 2 UM galaxies were performed on the basis of observations with the
ESO 3.6m telescope. All sample galaxies qualify with respect to their
photometric and spectroscopic properties as blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies.
Additionally, they show a good overlap with a comparison sample of 100
well-studied emission-line galaxies on the 12+log(O/H) vs. log(Ne/O), log(Ar/O)
and log(Fe/O) planes. From the analysis of the 2dFGRS subsample we report the
discovery of two new extremely metal-deficient BCDs with an oxygen abundance
12+log(O/H) < 7.6 and of another seven galaxies with 12+log(O/H) < 7.8.
Furthermore, we confirm previous oxygen abundance determinations for the BCDs

"The Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer Survey of OVI Emission in the
  Milky Way","We present a survey of OVI 1032 emission in the Milky Way using data from the
Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) satellite. The observations span
the period from launch in 1999 to July 2003. Our survey contains 112 sight
lines, 23 of which show measurable OVI 1032 emission. The OVI 1032 emission
feature was detected at all latitudes and exhibits intensities of 1900-8600
photons/s/cm^2/sr. Combined with values from the literature, these emission
measurements are consistent with the picture derived from recent OVI absorption
surveys: high-latitude sight lines probe OVI-emitting gas in a clumpy, thick

interfaces in the thin disk of the Galaxy.",2006-05-05T18:29:10Z
"Neutrino Spectra from Low and High Luminosity Populations of Gamma Ray
  Bursts","The detection of GRB 060218 at z=0.033 by {\em Swift} within 1.5 years of
operation, together with the detection of GRB 980425 at $z=0.0085$ by BeppoSAX,
suggest that these low-luminosity (LL) GRBs have a much higher event rate than
the canonical high-luminosity (HL) GRBs, and they form a distinct new component
in the GRB luminosity function. We explore the contribution of this previously
neglected GRB population to the diffuse neutrino background within the internal
shock model and compare it with that of the canonical HL population. By
considering a wide range of distributions of various parameters (e.g.
luminosity, spectral break energy, duration, variability time, Lorentz factor,
redshift) for both populations, we find that although it is difficult to detect
neutrinos from the individual LL GRBs, the contribution of the LL population to
the diffuse neutrino background is more than the HL population above about
$10^{8}$ GeV.",2006-06-30T02:03:40Z
"Robust Dark Energy Constraints from Supernovae, Galaxy Clustering, and
  Three-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe Observations","Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), galaxy clustering, and cosmic microwave background
anisotropy (CMB) data provide complementary constraints on the nature of the
dark energy in the universe. We find that the three-year Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) observations give a CMB shift parameter of R =
(\Omega_m H_0^2)^{1/2} \int_0^{z_{CMB}} dz'/H(z')= 1.70 \pm 0.03. Using this
new measured value of the CMB shift parameter, together with the baryon
acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurement from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS), and SN Ia data from the HST/GOODS program and the first year Supernova
Legacy Survey, we derive model-independent constraints on the dark energy
density rho_X(z) and the cosmic expansion rate H(z). We also derive constraints
on the dark energy equation of state w_X(z)=w_0+w'z (with cutoff at z=2) and
w_X(a)=w_0+(1-a)w_a.
  We find that current data provide slightly tighter constraints on rho_X(z)
and H(z) as free functions in redshift, and roughly a factor of two improvement
in constraining w_X(z). A cosmological constant remains consistent with data,
however, uncertainties remain large for model-independent constraints of dark
energy. Significant increase in the number of observed SNe Ia between redshifts
of 1 and 2, complemented by improved BAO and weak lensing cosmography
measurements (as expected from the JEDI mission concept for the Joint Dark
Energy Mission), will be required to dramatically tighten model-independent
dark energy constraints.",2006-04-04T18:45:53Z
"A Quantitative Analysis of the Available Multicolor Photometry for
  Rapidly Pulsating Hot B Subdwarfs","We present a quantitative and homogeneous analysis of the broadband
multicolor photometric data sets gathered so far on rapidly pulsating hot B
subdwarf stars. This concerns seven distinct data sets related to six different
stars. Our analysis is carried out within the theoretical framework developed
by Randall et al., which includes full nonadiabatic effects. The goal of this
analysis is partial mode identification, i.e., the determination of the degree
index l of each of the observed pulsation modes. We assume possible values of l
from 0 to 5 in our calculations. For each target star, we compute a specific
model atmosphere and a specific pulsation model using estimates of the
atmospheric parameters coming from time-averaged optical spectroscopy. For
every assumed value of l, we use a formal chi-squared approach to model the
observed amplitude-wavelength distribution of each mode, and we compute a
quality-of-fit Q probability to quantify the derived fit and to discriminate
objectively between the various solutions. We find that no completely
convincing and unambiguous l identification is possible on the basis of the
available data, although partial mode discrimination has been reached for 25
out of the 41 modes studied. A brief statistical study of these results
suggests that a majority of the modes must have l values of 0, 1, and 2, but
also that modes with l = 4 could very well be present while modes with l = 3
appear to be rarer. This is in line with recent results showing that l = 4
modes in rapidly pulsating B subdwarfs have a higher visibility in the optical
domain than modes with l = 3. Although somewhat disappointing in terms of mode
discrimination, our results still suggest that the full potential of multicolor
photometry for l identification in pulsating subdwarfs is within reach.",2006-06-20T14:51:32Z
Antenna-Coupled TES Bolometers for CMB Polarimetry,"We have developed a completely lithographic antenna-coupled bolometer for CMB
polarimetry. The necessary components of a millimeter wave radiometer -- a beam
forming element, a band defining filter, and the TES detectors -- are
fabricated on a silicon chip with photolithography. The densely populated
antennas allow a very efficient use of the focal plane area. We have fabricated
and characterized a series of prototype devices. We find that their properties,

theoretical expectations. The devices are undergoing optimization for upcoming
CMB experiments.",2006-06-14T22:40:24Z
Scalar quantities as detectors of non-Gaussianity on CMB maps,"We study the power of several scalar quantities constructed on the sphere
(presented in Monteserin et al. 2005) to detect non-Gaussianity on the
temperature distribution of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The test has
been performed using non-Gaussian CMB simulations with injected skewness or
kurtosis generated through the Edgeworth expansion. We have also taken into
account in the analysis the effect of anisotropic noise and the presence of a
Galactic mask. We find that the best scalars to detect an excess of skewness in
the simulations are the derivative of the gradient, the fractional isotropy,
the Laplacian and the shape index. For the kurtosis case, the fractional
anisotropy, the Laplacian and the determinant are the quantities that perform
better.",2006-04-17T18:08:24Z
"Simulation of Coherent Non-Linear Neutrino Flavor Transformation in the
  Supernova Environment I: Correlated Neutrino Trajectories","We present results of large-scale numerical simulations of the evolution of
neutrino and antineutrino flavors in the region above the late-time
post-supernova-explosion proto-neutron star. Our calculations are the first to
allow explicit flavor evolution histories on different neutrino trajectories
and to self-consistently couple flavor development on these trajectories
through forward scattering-induced quantum entanglement. Employing the
atmospheric-scale neutrino mass-squared difference and values of theta_13
allowed by current bounds, we find transformation of neutrino and antineutrino
flavors over broad ranges of energy and luminosity in roughly the ``bi-polar''
collective mode. We find that this large-scale flavor conversion, largely
driven by the flavor off-diagonal neutrino-neutrino forward scattering
potential, sets in much closer to the proto-neutron star than simple estimates
based on flavor-diagonal potentials and Mikeheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein evolution
would indicate. In turn, this suggests that models of r-process nucleosynthesis
sited in the neutrino-driven wind could be affected substantially by
active-active neutrino flavor mixing, even with the small measured neutrino
mass-squared differences.",2006-06-25T20:19:16Z
"Identification of the OGLE-2003-BLG-235/MOA-2003-BLG-53 Planetary Host
  Star","We present the results of HST observations of the host star for the first
definitive extrasolar planet detected by microlensing. The light curve model
for this event predicts that the lens star should be separated from the source
star by ~6mas at the time of the HST images. If the lens star is a late G, K or
early M dwarf, then it will be visible in the HST images as an additional
source of light that is blended with the source image. Unless the lens and
source have exactly the same colors, its presence will also be revealed by a
systematic shift between centroids of the source plus lens in different filter
bands. The HST data indicates both of these effects: the HST source that
matches the position of the source star is 0.21 magnitudes brighter in the
ACS/HRC-F814W filter than the microlensing model predicts, and there is an
offset of ~0.7mas between the centroid of this source in the F814W and F435W
filter bands. We conclude the planetary host star has been detected in these
HST images, and this identification of the lens star enables a complete
solution of the lens system. The lens parameters are determined with a Bayesian
analysis, averaging over uncertainties in the measured parameters, interstellar
extinction, and allowing for the possibility of a binary companion to the
source star. This yields a stellar mass of M_* = 0.63(+0.07/-0.09) M_solar and
a planet mass of M_p = 2.6 (+0.8/-0.6) M_Jup at an orbital separation of 4.3
(+2.5/-0.8) AU. Thus, the lens system resembles our own Solar System, with a
planet of ~3 Jupiter-masses in a Jupiter-like orbit around a star of two-thirds
of a Solar mass. These conclusions can be tested with future HST images, which
should reveal a broadening of the blended source-plus-lens point spread
function due to the relative lens-source proper motion.",2006-06-02T18:21:30Z
"Photometric survey of marginally investigated open clusters: I. Basel
  11b, King 14, Czernik 43","To progress in galactic studies based on open clusters, e.g. cluster
formation rate or kinematical properties, one needs to improve the number of
open clusters observed. However, only half of the 1700 known galactic open
clusters have been properly observed so far, making any statistical
investigation insignificant, especially at larger distances from the Sun. We
study marginally investigated or neglected open clusters with Bessell CCD BVR
photometry, whose data were used to fit isochrones to the individual
color-magnitude diagrams. We examined the galactic clusters Basel 11b, King 14
and Czernik 43, the last being observed for the first time to this extent. As
well as a careful comparison to available photometry, their parameters such as
age, interstellar reddening, distance and apparent diameter were determined.
The obtained cluster properties were verified by near infrared 2MASS data. The
three investigated intermediate age clusters are all located in the galactic
disk with distances between 1.8 and 3.0kpc from the Sun.",2006-04-12T10:33:35Z
The Massive Star Population in the Giant HII Region Tol89 in NGC5398,"We present new high spectral resolution VLT/UVES spectroscopy and archival
HST/STIS imaging and spectroscopy of the giant HII region Tol89 in NGC5398.
  From optical and UV HST images, we find that the star-forming complex as a
whole contains at least seven young compact massive clusters. We resolve the
two brightest optical knots, A and B, into five individual young massive
clusters along our slit, A1-4 and B1 respectively. From Starburst99 (Leitherer
et al.) UV spectral modelling, and nebular H beta equivalent widths in the
optical, we derive ages that are consistent with the formation of two separate
burst events, of ~4+/-1 Myr and <3 Myr for knots A (A1-4) and B (B1). An LMC
metallicity is measured for both knots, while nebular HeII 4686 is observed in
knot B and perhaps in knot A. We detect underlying broad wings on the strongest
nebular emission lines indicating velocities up to 600 km/s. We estimate that
there are ~95 early WN stars and ~35 early WC stars in Tol89-A, using empirical
template spectra of LMC WR stars from Crowther and Hadfield. Remarkably, we
also detect ~ three mid WNs in the smallest (mass) cluster in Tol89-A, A4. From
the strength of nebular H beta, we obtain N(O) ~690 and 2800 for knots A and B.
We also employ a complementary approach using Starburst99 models, in which the
O star content is inferred from the stellar continuum, and the WR population is
obtained from spectral synthesis of optical WR features using the grids from
Smith et al. We find reasonable agreement between the two methods for the O
star content and the N(WR)/N(O) ratio but find that the WR subtype distribution
is in error in the Starburst99 models, with far too few WN stars being
predicted. We attribute this failure to the neglect of rotational mixing in
evolutionary models. [abridged]",2006-05-03T18:56:01Z
"A Spitzer Space Telescope study of SN 2002hh: an infrared echo from a
  Type IIP supernova","We present late-time (590-994 d) mid-IR photometry of the normal, but
highly-reddened Type IIP supernova SN 2002hh. Bright, cool, slowly-fading
emission is detected from the direction of the supernova. Most of this flux
appears not to be driven by the supernova event but instead probably originates
in a cool, obscured star-formation region or molecular cloud along the
line-of-sight. We also show, however, that the declining component of the flux
is consistent with an SN-powered IR echo from a dusty progenitor CSM. Mid-IR
emission could also be coming from newly-condensed dust and/or an ejecta/CSM
impact but their contributions are likely to be small. For the case of a CSM-IR
echo, we infer a dust mass of as little as 0.036 M(solar) with a corresponding
CSM mass of 3.6(0.01/r(dg))M(solar) where r(dg) is the dust-to-gas mass ratio.
Such a CSM would have resulted from episodic mass loss whose rate declined
significantly about 28,000 years ago. Alternatively, an IR echo from a
surrounding, dense, dusty molecular cloud might also have been responsible for
the fading component. Either way, this is the first time that an IR echo has
been clearly identified in a Type IIP supernova. We find no evidence for or
against the proposal that Type IIP supernovae produce large amounts of dust via
grain condensation in the ejecta. However, within the CSM-IR echo scenario, the
mass of dust derived implies that the progenitors of the most common of
core-collapse supernovae may make an important contribution to the universal
dust content.",2006-05-23T10:42:35Z
"Sulphur abundances in disk stars as determined from the forbidden 10821
  A [SI] line","Aims: In this paper we aim to study the chemical evolution of sulphur in the
galactic disk, using a new optimal abundance indicator: the [SI] line at 10821
A. Similar to the optimal oxygen indicators, the [OI] lines, the [SI] line has
the virtues of being less sensitive to the assumed temperatures of the stars
investigated and of likely being less prone to non-LTE effects than other
tracers. Methods: High-resolution, near-infrared spectra of the [SI] line are
recorded using the Phoenix spectrometer on the Gemini South telescope. The
analysis is based on 1D, LTE model atmospheres using a homogeneous set of
stellar parameters. Results: The 10821 A [SI] line is suitable for an abundance
analysis of disk stars, and the sulphur abundances derived from it are
consistent with abundances derived from other tracers. We corroborate that, for
disk stars, the trend of sulphur-to-iron ratios with metallicity is similar to
that found for other alpha elements, supporting the idea of a common
nucleosynthetic origin.",2006-07-03T06:13:12Z
"High Energy Neutrinos and Cosmic-Rays from Low-Luminosity Gamma-Ray
  Bursts?","The recently discovered gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 060218/SN 2006aj is
classified as an X-ray Flash with very long duration driven possibly by a
neutron star. Since GRB 060218 is very near about 140 Mpc and very dim,
one-year observation by Swift suggests that the rate of GRB 060218-like events
might be very high so that such low luminosity GRBs (LL-GRBs) might form a
different population from the cosmological high luminosity GRBs (HL-GRBs). We
found that the high energy neutrino background from LL-GRBs could be comparable
with that from HL-GRBs. If each neutrino event is detected by IceCube, later
optical-infrared follow-up observations such as by Subaru and HST have
possibilities to identify a Type Ibc supernova associated with LL-GRBs, even if
gamma- and X-rays are not observed by Swift. This is in a sense a new window
from neutrino astronomy, which might enable us to confirm the existence of
LL-GRBs and to obtain information about their rate and origin. We also argue
LL-GRBs as high energy gamma-ray and cosmic-ray sources.",2006-07-06T13:12:35Z
Population III Generated Cosmic Rays and the Production of Li6,"We calculate the evolution of Li6 generated from cosmic rays produced by an
early population of massive stars. The computation is performed in the
framework of hierarchical structure formation and is based on cosmic star
formation histories constrained to reproduce the observed star formation rate
at redshift z \la 6, the observed chemical abundances in damped Lyman alpha
absorbers and in the intergalactic medium, and to allow for an early
reionization of the Universe at z\sim 11 by Pop III stars as indicated by the
third year results released by WMAP. We show that the pregalactic production of
the Li6 isotope in the IGM via these Pop III stars can account for the Li6
plateau observed in metal poor halo stars without additional over-production of
Li7. Our results depend on the efficiency of cosmic rays to propagate out of
minihalos and the fraction of supernovae energy deposited in cosmic rays. We
also compute the cosmic ray heating of the IGM gas. In general, we find
somewhat high temperatures (of order 10^5 K) implying that the cosmic rays
production of Li6 may be required to be confined to the so-called warm-hot IGM.",2006-05-24T17:48:29Z
"Automated derivation of stellar atmospheric parameters and chemical
  abundances: the MATISSE algorithm","We present an automated procedure for the derivation of atmospheric
parameters (Teff, log g, [M/H]) and individual chemical abundances from stellar
spectra. The MATrix Inversion for Spectral SythEsis (MATISSE) algorithm
determines a basis, B_\theta(\lambda), allowing to derive a particular stellar
parameter \theta by projection of an observed spectrum. The B_\theta(\lambda)
function is determined from an optimal linear combination of theoretical
spectra and it relates, in a quantitative way, the variations in the spectrum
flux with variations in \theta. An application of this method to the GAIA/RVS
spectral range is described, together with its performances for different types
of stars of various metallicities. Blind tests with synthetic spectra of
randomly selected parameters and observed input spectra are also presented. The
method gives rapid, accurate and stable results and it can be efficiently
applied to the study of stellar populations through the analysis of large
spectral data sets, including moderate to low signal to noise spectra.",2006-04-18T16:26:12Z
Binary Stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster,"We report on a high-spatial-resolution survey for binary stars in the
periphery of the Orion Nebula Cluster, at 5 - 15 arcmin (0.65 - 2 pc) from the
cluster center. We observed 228 stars with adaptive optics systems, in order to
find companions at separations of 0.13"" - 1.12"" (60 - 500 AU), and detected 13
new binaries. Combined with the results of Petr (1998), we have a sample of 275
objects, about half of which have masses from the literature and high
probabilities to be cluster members. We used an improved method to derive the
completeness limits of the observations, which takes into account the elongated
point spread function of stars at relatively large distances from the adaptive
optics guide star. The multiplicity of stars with masses >2 M_sun is found to
be significantly larger than that of low-mass stars. The companion star
frequency of low-mass stars is comparable to that of main-sequence M-dwarfs,
less than half that of solar-type main-sequence stars, and 3.5 to 5 times lower
than in the Taurus-Auriga and Scorpius-Centaurus star-forming regions. We find
the binary frequency of low-mass stars in the periphery of the cluster to be
the same or only slightly higher than for stars in the cluster core (<3 arcmin
from theta1C Ori). This is in contrast to the prediction of the theory that the
low binary frequency in the cluster is caused by the disruption of binaries due
to dynamical interactions. There are two ways out of this dilemma: Either the
initial binary frequency in the Orion Nebula Cluster was lower than in
Taurus-Auriga, or the Orion Nebula Cluster was originally much denser and
dynamically more active.",2006-07-31T09:34:58Z
An Optical Emission Line Survey of Large Planetary Nebulae,"Accurate emission line fluxes from planetary nebulae (PNe) provide important
constraints on the nature of the final phases of stellar evolution. Large,
evolved PNe may trace the latest stages of PN evolution, where material from
the AGB wind is returned to the interstellar medium. However, the low surface
brightness and spatially extended emission of large PNe have made accurate
measurements of line fluxes difficult with traditional long-slit spectroscopic
techniques. Furthermore, distinguishing these nebulae from HII regions,
supernova remnants, or interstellar gas ionized by a hot, evolved stellar core
can be challenging. Here, we report on an ongoing survey of large Galactic PNe
(r > 5') with the Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM), a Fabry-Perot spectrograph
designed to detect faint diffuse optical emission lines with high sensitivity
and spectral resolution. Our sample includes newly revealed H-alpha
enhancements from the AAO/UKST and WHAM H-alpha surveys of Parker et al. and
Haffner et al. We present accurate emission line fluxes of H-alpha, [NII], and
[OIII], and compare our data to other measurements. We use the emission line
ratios and kinematics of the ionized gas to assess, or in some cases reassess,
the identification of some nebulae.",2006-05-04T04:02:34Z
Using cosmology to constrain the topology of hidden dimensions,"A four-dimensional universe, arising from a flux compactification of Type IIB
string theory, contains scalar fields with a potential determined by
topological and geometric parameters of the internal -hidden- dimensions. We
show that inflation can be realized via rolling towards the large internal
volume minima that are generic in these scenarios, and we give explicit
formulae relating the microscopic parameters (e.g., the Euler number of the
internal space) to the cosmological observables (e.g., the spectral index). We
find that the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the running of the spectral index, and
the potential energy density at the minimum are related by consistency
relations and are exponentially small in the number of e-foldings. Further,
requiring that these models arise as low-energy limits of string theory
eliminates most of them, even if they are phenomenologically valid. In this
context, this approach provides a strategy for systematically falsifying
stringy inflation models.",2006-05-15T22:20:50Z
Pair emission from bare magnetized strange stars,"The dominant emission from bare strange stars is thought to be
electron-positron pairs, produced through spontaneous pair creation (SPC) in a
surface layer of electrons tied to the star by a superstrong electric field.
The positrons escape freely, but the electrons are directed towards the star
and quickly fill all available states, such that their degeneracy suppresses
further SPC. An electron must be reflected and gain energy in order to escape,
along with the positron. Each escaping electron leaves a hole that is
immediately filled by another electron through SPC. We discuss the collisional
processes that produce escaping electrons. When the Landau quantization of the
motion perpendicular to the magnetic field is taken into account,
electron-electron collisions can lead to an escaping electron only through a
multi-stage process involving higher Landau levels. Although the available
estimates of the collision rate are deficient in several ways, it appears that
the rate is too low for electron-electron collisions to be effective. A simple
kinetic model for electron-quark collisions leads to an estimate of the rate of
pair production that is analogous to thermionic emission, but the work function
is poorly determined.",2006-07-25T03:41:05Z
A Detection of [CII] line emission in the z=4.7 QSO BR1202-0725,"We present ~3'' resolution imaging of the z=4.7 QSO BR1202-0725 at 900 micron
from the Submillimeter Array. The two submillimeter continuum components are
clearly resolved from each other, and the positions are consistent with
previous lower frequency images. In addition, we detect [CII] line emission
from the northern component. The ratio of [CII] to far-infrared luminosity is
0.04% for the northern component, and an upper limit of < 0.03% is obtained for
the southern component. These ratios are similar to the low values found in
local ultraluminous galaxies, indicating that the excitation conditions are
different from those found in local field galaxies. X-ray emission is detected
by Chandra from the southern component at
L$_{0.5-2keV}=3\times10^{45}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, and detected at 99.6% confidence
from the northern component at L$_{0.5-2keV}\sim3\times10^{44}$erg~s$^{-1}$,
supporting the idea that BR1202-0725 is a pair of interacting galaxies at z=4.7
that each harbor an active nucleus.",2006-06-02T06:44:06Z
Polarised views of the drifting subpulse phenomenon,"I review recent results concerning the shape of drifting subpulse patterns,
and the relationship to model predictions. While a variety of theoretical
models exist for drifting subpulses, observers typically think in terms of a
spatio-temporal model of circulating beamlets. Assuming the model is correct,
geometric parameters have been inferred and animated ""maps"" of the beam have
been made. However, the model makes very specific predictions about the
curvature of the drift bands that have remained largely untested. Work so far
in this area indicates that drift bands tend not to follow the prediction, and
in some cases discontinuities are seen that are suggestive of the superposition
of out of phase drift patterns. Recent polarimetric observations also show that
the drift patterns in the two orthogonal polarisation modes are offset in
phase. In one case the pattern in one of the modes shows a discontinuity
suggesting no less than three superposed, out-of-phase drift patterns! I advise
caution in the interpretation of observational data in the context of overly
simplistic models.",2006-04-25T04:15:40Z
"Evolution in the Halo Masses of Isolated Galaxies between z~1 and z~0:
  From DEEP2 to SDSS","We measure the evolution in the virial mass-to-light ratio (M_{200}/L_B) and
virial-to-stellar mass ratio (M_{200}/M_\ast) for isolated ~ L* galaxies
between z~1 and z~0 by combining data from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey and
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Utilizing the motions of satellite galaxies
around isolated galaxies, we measure line-of-sight velocity dispersions and
derive dark matter halo virial masses for these host galaxies. At both epochs
the velocity dispersion of satellites correlates with host galaxy stellar mass,
\sigma\propto M_\ast^{0.4+/-0.1}, while the relation between satellite velocity
dispersion and host galaxy B-band luminosity may grow somewhat shallower from
\sigma\propto L_B^{0.6+/-0.1} at z~1 to \sigma\propto L_B^{0.4+/-0.1} at z~0.
The evolution in M_200/M_\ast from z~1 to z~0 displays a bimodality insofar as
host galaxies with stellar mass below M_\ast ~10^{11} M_Sun/h maintain a
constant ratio (the intrinsic increase is constrained to a factor of 1.1+/-0.7)
while host galaxies above M_\ast ~10^{11} M_Sun/h experience a factor of 4+/-3
increase in their virial-to-stellar mass ratio. This result can be easily
understood if galaxies below this stellar mass scale continue to form stars
while star formation in galaxies above this scale is quenched and the dark
matter halos of galaxies both above and below this scale grow in accordance
with LCDM cosmological simulations. Host galaxies that are red in U-B color
have larger satellite dispersions and hence reside on average in more massive
halos than blue galaxies at both z~1 and z~0. The redshift and host galaxy
stellar mass dependence of M_200/M_\ast agrees qualitatively with the
Millennium Run semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. (ABRIDGED)",2006-07-11T15:10:50Z
Precise radial velocities of giant stars: I. Stable stars,"Context: Future astrometric missions such as SIM PlanetQuest need very stable
reference stars. K giants have large luminosities, which place them at large
distances and thus the jitter of their photocenters by companions is relatively
small. Therefore K giants would be best suited as references. To confirm this
observationally a radial velocity survey is performed to quantify the level of
intrinsic variability in K giants.
  Aims: From this radial velocity survey we present 34 K giants with an
observed standard deviation of the radial velocity of less than 20 m/s. These
stars are considered ``stable'' and can be used as radial velocity standards.
  Methods: The radial velocity survey contains 179 K giants. All K giants have
a declination between -30 and +65 degrees and visual magnitude of 3-6 mag. The
Coude Auxiliary Telescope (CAT) at UCO/Lick Observatory is used to obtain
radial velocities with an accuracy of 5-8 m/s. The number of epochs for the 34
stable stars ranges from 11 to 28 with a total timespan of the observations
between 1800 and a little over 2200 days.
  Results: The observational results of the 34 ``stable'' stars are shown
together with a discussion about their position in the M_{V} vs. B-V diagram
and some conclusions concerning the radial velocity variability of K giants.
These results are in agreement with the theoretical predictions. K giants in a
certain range of the M_{V} vs. B-V diagram are suitable reference stars.",2006-04-25T11:20:52Z
"Air-Showers in Space and Z-Showers in Universe for Neutrino Astronomy

replenishment of tau flavor during neutrino flight into spaces; Tau-Air-Showers
escaping the Earth are the main traces amplified by its millions muon, billions
gamma and thousand billions photon secondaries. Earth edges and its sharp
shadows is the huge beam-dump detector for UHE neutrino and the almost
noise-free screen for tau air-showers (as well as for PeVs anti-neutrino
electron scattering on air electrons by resonant interactions). Crown array
detectors for horizontal Cherenkov signals on mountains, on balloons and
satellites widening the solid angle view are being elaborated; deep and wide
valleys are considered. MAGIC Telescopes pointing downward to terrestrial
grounds acts, for EeV Tau neutrino air-showers astronomy, as a massive tens of
km^3 water equivalent detector, making (in a given direction) it at present the
most powerful dedicated neutrino telescope at PeVs. MAGIC facing the sea edges
must also reveal mirrored downward UHECR Air-showers (Cherenkov) flashes.
Magic-crown systems may lead to largest neutrino detectors in near future. They
maybe located on top mountains, on planes or balloons or in satellite arrays.
They may be screened in deep valleys. MILAGRO (and past MILAGRITO or future
larger detectors) on a mountain top might already hide records of horizontal

The shortest modulation period Blazhko RR Lyrae star: SS Cnc,"Extended BV(RI)c CCD observations of SS Cnc, a short period RRab star are
presented. Nearly 1400 data points in each band have been obtained spanning
over 79 days during the spring of 2005. The star exhibits light curve
modulation, the so called Blazhko effect with small amplitude (B maximum
brightness varies 0.1 mag) and with the shortest modulation period (5.309 d)
ever observed. In the Fourier spectrum of the V light curve the pulsation
frequency components are detected up to the 24th harmonic order, and modulation
side lobe frequencies with significantly asymmetric amplitudes are seen up to
the 15th and 9th orders for the lower and higher frequency components,
respectively. Detailed comparison of the modulation behavior of SS Cnc and RR
Gem, the two recently discovered small amplitude, short modulation period
Blazhko stars is presented. The modulation frequency (f_m) appears in the
Fourier spectrum of both stars with similar amplitude. We also demonstrate that
the modulation frequencies have basically different properties as the pulsation
and modulation side lobe frequencies have, indicating that the physics behind
these frequency components are not the same. The discovery of small amplitude
modulations of RRab stars cautions that the large photometric surveys (MACHO,
OGLE) may seriously underestimate the number of modulated RR Lyrae stars.",2006-03-20T13:56:04Z
"Spitzer Observations of the Brightest Galaxies in X-ray-Luminous
  Clusters","We have studied the infrared properties of the brightest cluster galaxies
(BCGs) located in the cores of X-ray-luminous clusters at 0.15 < z < 0.35. The
majority of the BCGs are not particularly infrared-luminous compared with other
massive early-type galaxies, suggesting that the cluster environment has little
influence on the infrared luminosities of the BCGs. The exceptions, however,
are the BCGs in the three X-ray-brightest clusters in the sample, A1835, Z3146,
and A2390. These BCGs have a prominent far-infrared peak in their spectral
energy distributions (SEDs), and two of them (those in A1835 and Z3146) can be
classified as luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs: L_{IR} > 10^{11} L_{sun}).
Although radio AGNs are found to be prevalent among the BCGs, the infrared
luminosities of these three BCGs, judged from the infrared SED signatures, are
likely to be powered by star formation. Considering the overall trend that
clusters with shorter radiative gas cooling times harbor more infrared-luminous
BCGs, the enhanced star formation may be caused by the cooling cluster gas
accreting onto the BCGs.",2006-03-24T01:30:56Z
"Observations of the intense and ultra-long burst GRB041219a with the
  Germanium Spectrometer on INTEGRAL","GRB041219a is the brightest burst localised by INTEGRAL. The intense burst
occurred about ~250s after the precursor and the long delay enabled optical and
near infrared telescopes to observe the prompt emission. We present
comprehensive results of the temporal and spectral analyses, including line and
afterglow searches using the spectrometer, SPI, aboard INTEGRAL, BAT on Swift
and ASM on RXTE. We avail of multi-wavelength data to generate broadband
spectra of GRB041219a and afterglow. Spectra for the burst and sub-intervals
were fit by the Band model and also by the quasithermal model. The high
resolution Germanium spectrometer data were searched for emission and
absorption features and for gamma-ray afterglow. The overall burst and
sub-intervals are well fit by the Band model. The photon index below the break
energy shows a marked change after the quiescent time interval. In addition the
spectra are well described by a black body component with a power law. The
burst was detected by BAT and ASM during the long quiescent interval in SPI
indicating the central engine might not be dormant but that the emission occurs
in different bands. No significant emission or absorption features were found
and limits of 900 eV and 120 eV are set on the most significant features. No
gamma-ray afterglow was detected from the end of the prompt phase to ~12 hours
post-burst. Broadband spectra of the prompt emission were generated in 7 time
intervals using gamma-ray, x-ray, optical and near-infrared data and these were
compared to the high-redshift burst GRB050904. The optical and gamma-ray
emission are correlated in GRB041219a. The spectral lag was determined using
data from the BAT and it changes throughout the burst. A number of
pseudo-redshifts were evaluated and large dispersion in values was found.",2006-04-21T05:56:49Z

M_[4.5], where M_[4.5] is the absolute magnitude at 4.5 micron. The dispersion
in the near-infrared L-Z relation is smaller than the corresponding dispersion
in the optical L-Z relation. The subsequently derived stellar mass-metallicity
M-Z relation is 12+log(O/H) = (5.65 +/- 0.23) + (0.298 +/- 0.030) log Mstar.
and extends the SDSS M-Z relation to lower mass by about 2.5 dex. We find that
the dispersion in the M-Z relation is similar over five orders of magnitude in
stellar mass, and that the relationship between stellar mass and interstellar
medium metallicity is similarly tight from high-mass to low-mass systems. We
find a larger scatter at low mass in the relation between effective yield and
total baryonic mass. In fact, there are a few dwarf galaxies with large yields,
which is difficult to explain if galactic winds are ubiquitous in dwarf
galaxies. The low scatter in the L-Z and M-Z relationships are difficult to
understand if galactic superwinds or blowout are responsible for the low
metallicities at low mass or luminosity. Naively, one would expect an ever
increasing scatter at lower masses, which is not observed.",2006-05-01T20:00:11Z
"Inverse Compton Scenarios for the TeV Gamma-Ray Emission of the Galactic
  Centre","The intense Compton cooling of ultra-relativistic electrons in the
Klein-Nishina regime in radiation dominated environments, such as that found in
the Galactic Centre, may result in radically different electron spectra than
those produced by Synchrotron cooling. We explore these effects and their
impact on the X-ray and gamma-ray spectra produced in electron accelerators in
this region in comparison to elsewhere in our galaxy. We discuss the broad-band
emission expected from the newly discovered pulsar wind nebula G 359.95-0.04
and the possible relationship of this X-ray source to the central TeV gamma-ray
source HESS J1745-290. Finally we discuss the possible relationship of the
Galactic Centre INTEGRAL source IGR J1745.6-2901 to the TeV emission.",2006-07-25T11:44:06Z
"A SCUBA imaging survey of ultracompact HII regions: The environments of
  massive star formation","We present a SCUBA submillimetre (450 & 850 micron) survey of the environment
of 105 IRAS point sources, selected from the Wood & Churchwell (1989a) and
Kurtz, Churchwell & Wood (1994) radio ultracompact (UC) HII region surveys. We
detected a total of 155 sub-mm clumps associated with the IRAS point sources
and identified three distinct types of object: ultracompact cm-wave sources
that are not associated with any sub-mm emission (sub-mm quiet objects), sub-mm
clumps that are associated with ultracompact cm-wave sources (radio-loud
clumps); and sub-mm clumps that are not associated with any known ultracompact
cm-wave sources (radio-quiet clumps). 90% of the sample of IRAS point sources
were found to be associated with strong sub-mm emission. We consider the sub-mm
colours, morphologies and distance-scaled fluxes of the sample of sub-mm clumps
and show that the sub-mm quiet objects are unlikely to represent embedded UC
HII regions unless they are located at large heliocentric distances. Many of
the 2.5 arcmin SCUBA fields contain more than one sub-mm clump, with an average
number of companions (the companion clump fraction) of 0.90. The clumps are
more strongly clustered than other candidate HMPOs and the mean clump surface
density exhibits a broken power-law distribution with a break at 3 pc. We
demonstrate that the sub-mm and cm-wave fluxes of the majority of radio-loud
clumps are in excellent agreement with the standard model of ultracompact HII
regions. We speculate on the nature of the radio-quiet sub-mm clumps and,
whilst we do not yet have sufficient data to conclude that they are in a pre-UC
HII region phase, we argue that their characteristics are suggestive of such a
stage.",2006-04-10T15:28:41Z
"The effects of cosmic rays and solar flares on the IRAC detectors: the
  first two years of in-flight operation","The Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) is a four-channel camera on the Spitzer
Space Telescope, one of three focal plane science instruments. IRAC uses two
pairs of 256x256 pixel InSb and Si:As IBC detectors to provide simultaneous
imaging at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8 microns. IRAC experiences a flux of cosmic rays
and solar protons that produce transient effects in science images from each of
the arrays, with 4-6 pixels per second being affected during each integration.
During extreme solar flares, IRAC experiences a much higher rate of transients
which affects the science data quality. We present cosmic ray rates and
observed detector characteristics for IRAC during the first two years of
science operation, and rates observed in a period of elevated solar proton flux
during an intense solar flare in January 2005. We show the changes to the IRAC
detectors observed since launch, and assess their impacts to the science data
quality.",2006-07-26T02:50:10Z
van Stockum--Bonnor Spacetimes of Rigidly Rotating Dust,"Stationary, axisymmetric and asymptotically flat spacetimes of dust of which
trajectories are integral curves of the time translation Killing vector are
investigated. The flow has no Newtonian limit. Asymptotic flatness implies the
existence of singularities of the curvature scalar that are distributions and
that are not isolated from regularity regions of the flow. The singularities
are closely related to the presence of additional stresses that contribute
negative active mass to the total (Komar) mass, which is zero for
asymptotically flat spacetimes. Several families of solutions are constructed
and a multipole expansion is presented.",2006-03-29T15:31:13Z
"The Anisotropy in the Galaxy Velocity Field Originated from the
  Gravitational Pancaking Effect","We analyze the Millennium run semi-analytic galaxy catalog to explore
quantitatively the gravitational pancaking effect on the orientation of galaxy
velocity field. We first calculate the probability density distribution of the
cosine of the angle between the velocity of a field galaxy and the direction
normal to a local pancake plane which is determined using two nearest neighbor
field galaxies. A clear signal of alignment is detected for the case that the
pancake scale is in the range of $5-8h^{-1}$ Mpc. The tendency of the
velocity-pancake alignment is found to still exist when the pancakes are
determined using three neighbor galaxies, indicating that it has a spatial
coherence. The degree of the velocity-pancake alignment is shown to increase
with the velocity magnitude and the local density, while it decreases with the
separation distance from the galaxy to the pancake and disappears when the
pancake has a filamentary shape. A final conclusion is that our work may
provide another clue to understanding the large-scale structure in the
universe.",2006-06-17T07:46:41Z
"The QUEST RR Lyrae Survey II: The Halo Overdensities in the First
  Catalog","The first catalog of the RR Lyrae stars (RRLS) in the Galactic halo by the
QUEST Survey has been searched for significant overdensities that may be debris
from disrupted dwarf galaxies or globular clusters. Away from the major
overdensities, the distribution of these stars is adequately fit by a smooth
halo model, in which the flattening of the halo decreases with increasing
galactocentric distance (Preston et al 1991). This model was used to estimate
the ``background'' of RRLS on which the halo overdensities are overlaid. A
procedure was developed for recognizing groups of stars that constitute
significant overdensities with respect to this background. To test this
procedure, a Monte Carlo routine was used to make artificial RRLS surveys that
follow the smooth halo model, but with Poisson distributed noise in the numbers
of RRLS and, within limits, random variations in the positions and magnitudes
of the artificial stars. The artificial surveys created by this routine were
examined for significant groups in exactly the same way as the QUEST survey.
These calculations provided estimates of the frequencies with which random
fluctuations produce significant groups. In the QUEST survey, there are six
significant overdensities that contain six or more stars and several smaller
ones. The small ones and possibly one or two of the larger ones may be
artifacts of statistical fluctuations, and they need to be confirmed by
measurements of radial velocity and/or proper motion. The most prominent groups
are the northern stream from the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy and a
large group in Virgo. Two other groups lie in the direction of the Monoceros
stream and at approximately the right distance for membership. Another group is
related to the globular cluster Palomar 5.",2006-04-17T20:30:20Z
The Radio/Optical Catalog of the SSA13 Field,"We present a 1.4-GHz catalog of 810 radio sources (560 sources in the
complete sample) with 1.8"" resolution found within a 17' radius in the SSA13
field (RA=13h12m,DEC=42d38'). The radio image from the VLA has an rms noise
level of 4.82 microJy/beam at the field center, and Subaru optical images in
r-band (6300A) and z-band (9200A) have a three-sigma detection magnitude of
26.1 and 24.9, respectively. 88% of the radio sources are identified with an
optical counterpart, and there is significantly more reddening for objects
fainter than 24-mag. The radio and optical parameters are tabulated, and source
morphologies are displayed by radio contours overlaying optical false-color
images. The radio structures show a wealth of complexity and these are
classified into a small number of categories. About one-third of the radio
sources are larger than 1.2"" and their orientation is often similar to that of
the associated galaxy or binary-galaxy system. The density of sources in the
SSA13 field above 75 microJy is 0.40 per square arcmin, with a slope of -2.43
in the differential counts. The radio spectral index may steepen for sources
below 75 microJy. We estimate that at most 40% of the microJansky radio sources
are dominated by AGN processes.",2006-07-04T19:08:15Z
The Rise Time of Type Ia Supernovae from the Supernova Legacy Survey,"We compare the rise times of nearby and distant Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia)
as a test for evolution using 73 high-redshift spectroscopically-confirmed SNe
Ia from the first two years of the five year Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) and
published observations of nearby SN. Because of the ``rolling'' search nature
of the SNLS, our measurement is approximately 6 times more precise than
previous studies, allowing for a more sensitive test of evolution between
nearby and distant supernovae. Adopting a simple $t^2$ early-time model (as in
previous studies), we find that the rest-frame $B$ rise times for a fiducial SN
Ia at high and low redshift are consistent, with values
$19.10^{+0.18}_{-0.17}({stat}) \pm 0.2 ({syst})$ and $19.58^{+0.22}_{-0.19}$
days, respectively; the statistical significance of this difference is only 1.4
\sg . The errors represent the uncertainty in the mean rather than any
variation between individual SN. We also compare subsets of our high-redshift
data set based on decline rate, host galaxy star formation rate, and redshift,
finding no substantive evidence for any subsample dependence.",2006-07-17T00:07:17Z
Radio and millimeter observations of z~2 luminous QSOs,"We present Very Large Array observations at 1.4 and 5 GHz of a sample of 16
quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) at z = 1.78 to 2.71. Half of the chosen quasars
are bright at mm wavelengths (250 or 350 GHz) while the other half were not
detected at mm wavelengths; the former QSOs were detected at 1.4 GHz, in most
cases at high significance (S/N > ~7), but only three of the latter sources
were detected at radio frequencies, and only at lower significance (S/N ~ 3).
The data are consistent with a correlation between the mm and radio fluxes
indicating a physical connection between the mechanisms responsible for the
radio and mm emission. However, this conclusion is based on data which includes
many upper limits, and deeper observations are clearly needed to verify this
correlation.
  All eight mm detected QSOs are detected in the radio continuum, with radio
flux densities consistent with the radio-to-FIR correlation for low z star
forming galaxies. However, four of these have flatter spectral indices than is
typical for star forming galaxies (i.e. greater than -0.5) suggesting that
radiation from the central AGN dominates the observed radio emission. All the
sources detected at 1.4 GHz are spatially unresolved, with the size limits
typically < 1'' = 6 kpc. High star formation rate galaxies at low redshift are
typically nuclear starbursts, with sizes < 1 kpc. Hence, the current radio size
limits are insufficient to constrain the emission model (AGN or starburst).",2006-05-02T23:54:13Z
"Strong lensing statistics in large, z~<0.2 surveys: bias in the lens
  galaxy population","We calculate the expected lensing statistics of the galaxy population in
large, low-redshift surveys. Galaxies are modeled using realistic, multiple
components: a dark matter halo, a bulge component and disc. We use
semi-analytic models of galaxies coupled with dark matter haloes in the
Millennium Run to model the lens galaxy population. We predict that a fraction
of 1.4+/-0.18*10^-3 of radio sources will be lensed by galaxies within a survey
like the 2dF below z<0.2. With a simulated sample of lensed radio sources, the
predicted lensing galaxy population consists mainly of ellipticals (~80%) with
an average lens velocity dispersion of 164+/-3 km/s, producing typical image
separations of ~3 arcsec. The lens galaxy population lies on the fundamental
plane but its velocity dispersion distribution is shifted to higher values
compared to all early-type galaxies. Taking magnification bias into account, we
predict that the ratio of 4:2 image systems is 30+/-5%, consistent with the
observed ratio found in the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey. We also find that the
population of 4-image lens galaxies is distinguishable from the population of
lens galaxies in 2-image systems. Our key result is the explicit demonstration
that the population of lens galaxies differs markedly from the galaxy
population as a whole: lens galaxies have a higher average luminosity and
reside in more massive haloes than the overall sample of ellipticals. This bias
restricts our ability to infer galaxy evolution parameters from a sample of
lensing galaxies. (abridged)",2006-07-03T20:43:26Z
"Barium even-to-odd isotope abundance ratios in thick disk and thin disk
  stars","We present the Ba even-to-odd isotope abundance ratios in 25 cool dwarf stars
with the metallicity [Fe/H] ranged between 0.25 and --1.35. Our method takes
advantage of the hyperfine structure (HFS) affecting the \ion{Ba}{ii} resonance
line of the odd isotopes. The fractional abundance of the odd isotopes of Ba is
derived from a requirement that Ba abundances from the resonance line $\lambda
4554$ and subordinate lines $\lambda 5853$ and $\lambda 6496$ must be equal.
The results are based on NLTE line formation and analysis of high resolution (R
$\sim60000$) high signal-to-noise (S/N $\ge 200$) observed spectra. We find
that the fraction of the odd isotopes of Ba grows toward the lower Ba abundance
(or metallicity) and the mean value in the thick disk stars equals 33 $\pm$ 4%.
This indicates the higher contribution of the $r-$process to barium in the
thick disk stars compared to the solar system matter. The obtained fraction
increases with the [Eu/Ba] abundance ratio growth in agreement with
expectations. A significant fraction of the \emph{even} isotopes of Ba found in
old Galactic stars (the thick disk stars), $\sim67$%, is in contrast to the
prediction of the ""classical"" model of the $s-$process and favors the value
predicted by the ""stellar"" models of Arlandini et al. (1999) and Travaglio et
al. (1999).",2006-04-10T10:37:24Z
The Orbital Period of the Ultraluminous X-ray Source in M82,"The ultraluminous x-ray source (ULX) in the galaxy M82 has been identified as
a possible intermediate-mass black hole. We have found that the x-ray flux from
M82 is modulated with a peak-to-peak amplitude corresponding to an isotropic
luminosity of 2.4x10^40 erg/s in M82 and a period of 62.0 +/- 2.5 days, which
we interpret as the orbital period of the ULX binary. This orbital period
implies that the mass-donor star must be a giant or supergiant. Large
mass-transfer rates, sufficient to fuel the ULX, are expected for a giant-phase
mass donor in an x-ray binary. The giant phase has a short lifetime, indicating
that we see the ULX in M82 in a brief and unusual period of its evolution.",2006-03-24T00:10:05Z
Binary Stellar Population Synthesis Study of Elliptical Galaxies,"We determine relative stellar ages and metallicities mainly for about 80
elliptical galaxies in low and high density environments via the latest binary
stellar population (BSP) synthesis model and test a latest hierarchical
formation model of elliptical galaxies which adopted the new $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology for the first time. The stellar ages and metallicities of galaxies
are estimated from two high-quality published spectra line indices, i.e.
H$\beta$ and [MgFe]. The results show that elliptical galaxies have stellar
populations older than 3.9 Gyr and more metal rich than 0.02. Most of our
results are in agreement with predictions of the model: First, elliptical
galaxies in denser environment are redder and have older populations than field
galaxies. Second, elliptical galaxies with more massive stellar components are
redder while have older and more metal rich populations than less massive ones.
Third, the most massive galaxies are shown to have the oldest and most metal
rich stars. However, some of our results are found to be different with
predictions of the galaxy formation model, i.e. the metallicity distributions
of low- and high-density elliptical galaxies and the relations relating to
cluster-centric distance.",2006-05-24T02:45:46Z
A model for the infrared emission of FSC 10214+4724,"A model for the infrared emission of the high redshift ultraluminous infrared
galaxy FSC 10214+4724 is presented. The model assumes three components of
emission: a dusty torus viewed edge-on, clouds that are associated with the
narrow-line region and a highly obscured starburst. It is demonstrated that the
presence of clouds in the narrow-line region, with a covering factor of 17%,
can explain why the mid-infrared spectrum of FSC 10214+4724 shows a silicate
feature in emission despite the fact that its torus is viewed edge-on. It is
also shown that the same model, but with the torus viewed face-on, predicts a
spectrum with silicate emission features that is characteristic of the spectra
of quasars recently observed with Spitzer.",2006-06-29T10:33:36Z
"On the formation of extended galactic disks by tidally disrupted dwarf
  galaxies","We explore the possibility that extended disks, such as that recently
discovered in M31, are the result of a single dwarf (10^9--10^10 Msun)
satellite merger. We carry out N-body simulations of dwarf NFW halos with
embedded spheriodal stellar components on co-planar, prograde orbits in a
M31-like host galaxy. As the orbit decays due to dynamical friction and the
system is disrupted, the stellar particles form an extended, exponential
disk-like structure that spans the radial range 30--200 kpc once they have
relaxed. The disk scale-length correlates with the initial extent of the
stellar component within the satellite halo: the more embedded the stars, the
smaller the resulting disk scale-length. If the progenitors start on circular
orbits, the kinematics of the stars that make up the extended disk have an
average rotational motion that is 30--50 km/s lower than the host's circular
velocity. For dwarf galaxies moving on highly eccentric orbits (e=0.7), the
stellar debris exhibits a much lower rotational velocity. Our results imply
that extended galactic disks might be a generic feature of the hierarchical
formation of spiral galaxies such as M31 and the Milky Way.",2006-06-05T23:23:48Z
Active Galactic Nuclei at the Crossroads of Astrophysics,"Over the last five decades, AGN studies have produced a number of spectacular
examples of synergies and multifaceted approaches in astrophysics. The field of
AGN research now spans the entire spectral range and covers more than twelve
orders of magnitude in the spatial and temporal domains. The next generation of
astrophysical facilities will open up new possibilities for AGN studies,
especially in the areas of high-resolution and high-fidelity imaging and
spectroscopy of nuclear regions in the X-ray, optical, and radio bands. These
studies will address in detail a number of critical issues in AGN research such
as processes in the immediate vicinity of supermassive black holes, physical
conditions of broad-line and narrow-line regions, formation and evolution of
accretion disks and relativistic outflows, and the connection between nuclear
activity and galaxy evolution.",2006-06-07T10:27:52Z
Saving Planetary Systems: Dead Zones & Planetary Migration,"The tidal interaction between a disk and a planet leads to the planet's
migration. A long-standing question regarding this mechanism is how to stop the
migration before planets plunge into their central stars. In this paper, we
propose a new, simple mechanism to significantly slow down planet migration,
and test the possibility by using a hybrid numerical integrator to simulate the
disk-planet interaction. The key component of the scenario is the role of low
viscosity regions in protostellar disks known as dead zones, which affect
planetary migration in two ways. First of all, it allows a smaller-mass planet
to open a gap, and hence switch the faster type I migration to the slower type
II migration. Secondly, a low viscosity slows down type II migration itself,
because type II migration is directly proportional to the viscosity. We present
numerical simulations of planetary migration by using a hybrid symplectic
integrator-gas dynamics code. Assuming that the disk viscosity parameter inside
the dead zone is (alpha=1e-4-1e-5), we find that, when a low-mass planet (e.g.
1-10 Earth masses) migrates from outside the dead zone, its migration is
stopped due to the mass accumulation inside the dead zone. When a low-mass
planet migrates from inside the dead zone, it opens a gap and slows down its
migration. A massive planet like Jupiter, on the other hand, opens a gap and
slows down inside the dead zone, independent of its initial orbital radius. The
final orbital radius of a Jupiter mass planet depends on the dead zone's
viscosity. For the range of alpha's noted above, this can vary anywhere from 7
AU, to an orbital radius of 0.1 AU that is characteristic of the hot Jupiters.",2006-06-09T16:11:57Z
On the efficiency of Fermi acceleration at relativistic shocks,"It is shown that Fermi acceleration at an ultra-relativistic shock wave
cannot operate on a particle for more than 1 1/2 Fermi cycle (i.e., u -> d -> u
-> d) if the particle Larmor radius is much smaller than the coherence length
of the magnetic field on both sides of the shock, as is usually assumed. This
conclusion is shown to be in excellent agreement with recent numerical
simulations. We thus argue that efficient Fermi acceleration at
ultra-relativistic shock waves requires significant non-linear processing of
the far upstream magnetic field with strong amplification of the small scale
magnetic power. The streaming or transverse Weibel instabilities are likely to
play a key role in this respect.",2006-05-31T20:30:47Z
"New nonadiabatic pulsation computations on full PG1159 evolutionary
  models: the theoretical GW Vir instability strip revisited","We reexamine the theoretical instability domain of pulsating PG1159 stars (GW
Vir variables). We performed an extensive g-mode stability analysis on PG1159
evolutionary models with stellar masses ranging from 0.530 to 0.741 Mo for
which the complete evolutionary stages of their progenitors from the ZAMS,
through the thermally pulsing AGB and born-again phases to the domain of the
PG1159 stars have been considered. We found that pulsations in PG1159 stars are
excited by the kappa-mechanism due to partial ionization of carbon and oxygen,
and that no composition gradients are needed between the surface layers and the
driving region, much in agreement with previous studies. We show, for the first
time, the existence of a red edge of the instability strip at high
luminosities. We found that all of the GW Vir stars lay within our theoretical
instability strip. Our results suggest a qualitative good agreement between the
observed and the predicted ranges of unstable periods of individual stars.
Finally, we found that generally the seismic masses (derived from the period
spacing) of GW Vir stars are somewhat different from the masses suggested by
evolutionary tracks coupled with spectroscopy. Improvements in the evolution
during the thermally pulsing AGB phase and/or during the core helium burning
stage and early AGB could help to alleviate the persisting discrepancies.",2006-07-03T19:05:28Z
Low-Mass Binary Induced Outflows from Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars,"A significant fraction of planetary nebulae (PNe) and proto-planetary nebulae
(PPNe) exhibit aspherical, axisymmetric structures, many of which are highly
collimated. The origin of these structures is not entirely understood, however
recent evidence suggests that many observed PNe harbor binary systems, which
may play a role in their shaping. In an effort to understand how binaries may
produce such asymmetries, we study the effect of low-mass (< 0.3 M_sun)
companions (planets, brown dwarfs and low-mass main sequence stars) embedded
into the envelope of a 3.0 M_sun star during three epochs of its evolution (Red
Giant Branch, Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB), interpulse AGB). We find that
common envelope evolution can lead to three qualitatively different
consequences: (i) direct ejection of envelope material resulting in a
predominately equatorial outflow, (ii) spin-up of the envelope resulting in the
possibility of powering an explosive dynamo driven jet and (iii) tidal
shredding of the companion into a disc which facilitates a disc driven jet. We
study how these features depend on the secondary's mass and discuss
observational consequences.",2006-04-20T20:27:24Z
The detectability of HI 21-cm absorption in damped Lyman-alpha systems,"In this paper we investigate the possible reasons why HI 21-cm absorption in
damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs) has only been detected at low redshift... We
suggest that the lack of 21-cm absorption detections at high redshift arises
from the fact that these DLAs are at similar angular diameter distances to the
background quasars (i.e. the distance ratios are always close to unity): Above
z~1.6 the covering factor becomes largely independent of the DLA--QSO distance,
making the high redshift absorbers much less effective at covering the
background continuum emission. At low redshift, small distance ratios are
strongly favoured by the 21-cm detections, whereas large ratios are favoured by
the non-detections. This mix of distance ratios gives the observed mix of
detections and non-detections at z<1.6.In addition to the predominance of large
distance ratios and non-detections at high redshift, this strongly suggests
that the observed distribution of 21-cm absorption in DLAs is dominated by
geometric effects.",2006-06-08T01:07:15Z
High-resolution X-ray Spectroscopy of BD +30 3639,"We present preliminary results from the first X-ray gratings spectrometer
observations of a planetary nebula (PN). We have used the Chandra X-ray
Observatory Low Energy Transmission Gratings Spectrometer (LETGS) to observe
the bright, diffuse X-ray source within the well-studied BD +30 3639. The LETGS
spectrum of BD +30 3639 displays prominent and well-resolved emission lines of
H-like C, O, and Ne and He-like O and Ne. Initial modeling indicates a plasma
temperature T_x ~ 2.5x10^6 K and abundance ratios of C/O ~ 20, N/O <~ 1, Ne/O ~
4, and Fe/O <~ 0.1. These results suggest that the X-ray-emitting plasma is
dominated by the shocked fast wind from the emerging PN core, where this wind
gas likely originated from the intershell region of the progenitor asymptotic
giant branch star.",2006-07-07T20:21:04Z
"X-ray observations of three young, early-type galaxies","Massive halos of hot plasma exist around some, but not all elliptical
galaxies. There is evidence that this is related to the age of the galaxy. In
this paper new X-ray observations are presented for three early-type galaxies
that show evidence of youth, in order to investigate their X-ray components and
properties. NGC 5363 and NGC 2865 were found to have X-ray emission dominated
by purely discrete stellar sources. Limits are set on the mass distribution in
one of the galaxies observed with XMM-Newton, NGC 4382, which contains
significant hot gas. We detect the X-ray emission in NGC 4382 out to 4r$_e$.
The mass-to-light ratio is consistent with a stellar origin in the inner
regions but rises steadily to values indicative of some dark matter by 4r$_e$.
These results are set in context with other data drawn from the literature, for
galaxies with ages estimated from dynamical or spectroscopic indicators. Ages
obtained from optical spectroscopy represent central luminosity weighted
stellar ages. We examine the X-ray evolution with age, normalised by B and K
band luminosities. Low values of Log(L$_X$/L$_B$) and Log(L$_X$/L$_K$) are
found for all galaxies with ages between 1 and 4 Gyrs. Luminous X-ray emission
only appears in older galaxies. This suggests that the interstellar medium is
removed and then it takes several gigayears for hot gas halos to build up,
following a merger. A possible mechanism for gas expulsion might be associated
with feedback from an active nucleus triggered during a merger.",2006-05-19T18:06:43Z
"C18O (3-2) observations of the Cometary Globule CG 12: a cold core and a
  C18O hot spot","The feasibility of observing the C18O (3-2) spectral line in cold clouds with
the APEX telescope has been tested. As the line at 329.330 GHz lies in the wing
of a strong atmospheric H2O absorption it can be observed only at high altitude
observatories. Using the three lowest rotational levels instead of only two
helps to narrow down the physical properties of dark clouds and globules. The
centres of two C18O maxima in the high latitude low mass star forming region CG
12 were mapped in C18O (3-2) and the data were analyzed together with spectral
line data from the SEST. The T_MB(3-2)/T_MB(2-1) ratio in the northern C18O
maximum, CG 12 N, is 0.8, and in the southern maximum, CG 12 S, ~2. CG 12 N is
modelled as a 120'' diameter (0.4pc) cold core with a mass of 27 Msun. A small
size maximum with a narrow, 0.8 kms-1, C18O (3-2) spectral line with a peak
temperature of T_MB ~11 K was detected in CG 12 S. This maximum is modelled as
a 60'' to 80'' diameter (~0.2pc) hot (80 K < Tex < 200 K) ~1.6 Msun clump. The
source lies on the axis of a highly collimated bipolar molecular outflow near
its driving source. This is the first detection of such a compact, warm object
in a low mass star forming region.",2006-06-06T13:54:04Z
Magnetic Jets from Swirling Disks,"A broad swathe of astrophysical phenomena, ranging from tubular planetary
nebulae through Herbig-Haro objects, radio-galaxy and quasar emissions to
gamma-ray bursts and perhaps high-energy cosmic rays, may be driven by
magnetically-dominated jets emanating from accretion disks. We give a
self-contained account of the analytic theory of non-relativistic magnetically
dominated jets wound up by a swirling disk and making a magnetic cavity in a
background medium of any prescribed pressure, p(z). We solve the time-dependent
problem for any specified distribution of magnetic flux P(R,0) emerging from
the disk at z=0, with any specified disk angular velocity Omega_d(R). The
physics required to do this involves only the freezing of the lines of force to
the conducting medium and the principle of minimum energy.",2006-04-20T08:58:21Z
SZ Surveys are Coming: What should we do?,"Galaxy clusters furnish extremely rich information on the contents and
structure of our universe. The potential of galaxy cluster studies to constrain
dark energy, for example, motivates a number of ambitious cluster surveys.
Among these, surveys based on the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect are
particularly powerful for their ability to cleanly select clusters out to
redshifts z>1. Now poised to begin surveying substantial areas of sky,
dedicated interferometers, bolometer cameras and the Planck satellite will soon
produce large cluster catalogs that will provide a precise measure of the
cosmic expansion rate over a range of redshifts and precipitate a new
understanding of structure and galaxy formation. I review the science potential
of these surveys and examine some issues of SZ cluster catalog construction.",2006-06-09T18:30:25Z
[CI] 492 GHz mapping toward Cas A,"We have mapped the [C I] emission at 492 GHz toward the supernova remnant Cas
A. We detect [C I] emission from the periphery of the diffuse Photon Dominated
Region (PDR) covering the disk of Cas A, as traced by the carbon recombination
lines, as well as from the denser PDRs associated with the molecular clouds
towards the south-east. [C I] emission is detected from both the Perseus and
Orion arm molecular clouds, with the -47 km s^-1 Perseus arm feature being
strong enough to be detected at all positions. We estimate the C/CO relative
abundance to be 0.2 at the position of the identified CO clouds and >1 for most
of the cloud. Here we show that the distribution of [C I] emitting regions
compared to the C+ region and molecular cloud is consistent with a scenario
involving PDRs. Using physical models for PDRs we constrain the physical
properties of the [C I] line-forming regions. We estimate the densities of the
[C I] emitting regions to be between 10^2 and 10^3 cm^-3. Based on rather high
volume filling factors (~50%) we conclude that [C I] emission mainly arises
from diffuse neutral gas in the Perseus arm.",2006-06-19T15:25:04Z
"RXTE Observations of 1A 1744-361: Correlated Spectral and Timing
  Behavior","We analyze Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) Proportional Counter Array
(PCA) data of the transient low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) system 1A 1744-361. We
explore the X-ray intensity and spectral evolution of the source, perform
timing analysis, and find that 1A 1744-361 shows `atoll' behavior during the
outbursts. The color-color diagram indicates that this LMXB was observed in a
low intensity spectrally hard (low-hard) state and in a high intensity `banana'
state. The low-hard state shows a horizontal pattern in the color-color
diagram, and the previously reported `dipper QPO' appears only during this
state. We also perform energy spectral analyses, and report the first detection
of broad iron emission line and iron absorption edge from 1A 1744-361.",2006-07-20T15:47:19Z
"A non-linear resonance model for the black hole and neutron star QPOs:
  theory supported by observations","Kilohertz Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) have been detected in many
accreting X-ray binaries. It has been suggested that the highest QPO
frequencies observed in the modulation of the X-ray flux reflect a non-linear
resonance between two modes of accreting disk oscillation. This hypothesis
implies certain very general predictions, several of which have been borne out
by observations. Some of these follow from properties of non-linear
oscillators, while the others are specific to oscillations of fluid in strong
gravity. A 3:2 resonant ratio of frequencies can be clearly recognized in the
black-hole as well as in the neutron-star QPO data.",2006-03-31T11:13:58Z
"A Very High Spectral Resolution Study of Ground-State OH Masers in
  W3(OH)","We present VLBA observations of the ground-state hydroxyl masers in W3(OH) at
0.02 km s-1 spectral resolution. Over 250 masers are detected, including 56
Zeeman pairs. Lineshapes are predominantly Gaussian or combinations of several
Gaussians, with normalized deviations typically of the same magnitude as in
masers in other species. Typical FWHM maser linewidths are 0.15 to 0.38 km s-1
and are larger in the 1665 MHz transition than in the other three ground-state
transitions. The satellite-line 1612 and 1720 MHz masers show no evidence of
sigma^+/-2,3 components. The spatial positions of most masers are seen to vary
across the line profile, with many spots showing clear, organized positional
gradients. Equivalent line-of-sight velocity gradients in the plane of the sky
typically range from 0.01 to 1 km s-1 AU-1 (i.e., positional gradients of 1 to
100 AU (km s-1)-1). Small velocity gradients in the 1667 MHz transition support
theoretical predictions that 1667 MHz masers appear in regions with small
velocity shifts along the amplification length. Deconvolved maser spot sizes
appear to be larger in the line wings but do not support a spherical maser
geometry.",2006-04-25T21:19:09Z
"Cosmological Magnetic Field: a fossil of density perturbations in the
  early universe","The origin of the substantial magnetic fields that are found in galaxies and
on even larger scales, such as in clusters of galaxies, is yet unclear. If the
second-order couplings between photons and electrons are considered, then
cosmological density fluctuations, which explain the large scale structure of
the universe, can also produce magnetic fields on cosmological scales before
the epoch of recombination. By evaluating the power spectrum of these
cosmological magnetic fields on a range of scales, we show here that magnetic
fields of 10^{-18.1} gauss are generated at a 1 megaparsec scale and can be
even stronger at smaller scales (10^{-14.1} gauss at 10 kiloparsecpc). These
fields are large enough to seed magnetic fields in galaxies and may therefore
have affected primordial star formation in the early universe.",2006-03-23T10:24:05Z
"Cosmic reionization constraints on the nature of cosmological
  perturbations","We study the reionization history of the Universe in cosmological models with
non-Gaussian density fluctuations, taking them to have a renormalized $\chi^2$
probability distribution function parametrized by the number of degrees of
freedom, $\nu$. We compute the ionization history using a simple
semi-analytical model, considering various possibilities for the astrophysics
of reionization. In all our models we require that reionization is completed
prior to $z=6$, as required by the measurement of the Gunn--Peterson optical
depth from the spectra of high-redshift quasars. We confirm previous results
demonstrating that such a non-Gaussian distribution leads to a slower
reionization as compared to the Gaussian case. We further show that the recent
WMAP three-year measurement of the optical depth due to electron scattering,
$\tau=0.09 \pm 0.03$, weakly constrains the allowed deviations from Gaussianity
on the small scales relevant to reionization if a constant spectral index is
assumed. We also confirm the need for a significant suppression of star
formation in mini-halos, which increases dramatically as we decrease $\nu$.",2006-06-05T10:23:57Z
The Environmental Impact of Lyman-break Galaxies,"We perform cosmological simulations of galaxies forming at z=3 using the
hydrodynamics grid code, Enzo. By selecting the largest galaxies in the volume
to correspond to Lyman-break galaxies, we construct observational spectra of
the HI flux distribution around these objects, as well as column densities of
CIV and OVI throughout a refined region. We successfully reproduce the most
recent observations of the mean HI flux in the close vicinity of Lyman-break
galaxies but see no evidence for the proximity effect in earlier observations.
While our galaxies do return metals to the IGM, their quantity and volume
appears to be somewhat less than observed. We conclude that either we do not
adequately resolve galactic winds, or that at least some of the intergalactic
metal enrichment is by early epoch objects whose mass is smaller than our
minimum resolved halo mass.",2006-03-24T20:36:51Z
X-ray Spectroscopy of the Contact Binary VW Cephei,"Short-period binaries represent extreme cases in the generation of stellar
coronae via a rotational dynamo. Such stars are important for probing the
origin and nature of coronae in the regimes of rapid rotation and activity
saturation. VW Cep (P=0.28 d) is a relatively bright, partially eclipsing, and
very active object. Light curves made from Chandra/HETGS data show flaring and
rotational modulation, but no eclipses. Velocity modulation of emission lines
indicates that one component dominates the X-ray emission. The emission measure
is highly structured, having three peaks. Helium-like triplet lines give
electron densities of about 3.0E+10 - 18.0E+10 /cm^3. We conclude that the
corona is predominantly on the polar regions of the primary star and compact.",2006-06-28T19:07:41Z
"Tempo2, a new pulsar timing package. II: The timing model and precision
  estimates","Tempo2 is a new software package for the analysis of pulsar pulse times of
arrival. In this paper we describe in detail the timing model used by tempo2,
and discuss limitations on the attainable precision. In addition to the
intrinsic slow-down behaviour of the pulsar, tempo2 accounts for the effects of
a binary orbital motion, the secular motion of the pulsar or binary system,
interstellar, Solar system and ionospheric dispersion, observatory motion
(including Earth rotation, precession, nutation, polar motion and orbital
motion), tropospheric propagation delay, and gravitational time dilation due to
binary companions and Solar system bodies. We believe the timing model is
accurate in its description of predictable systematic timing effects to better
than one nanosecond, except in the case of relativistic binary systems where
further theoretical development is needed. The largest remaining sources of
potential error are measurement error, interstellar scattering, Solar system
ephemeris errors, atomic clock instability and gravitational waves.",2006-07-31T01:46:28Z
WMAP 3-year polarization data: Implications for the reionization history,"We show that the delay of structure formation can not fully account for the
reduction of electron optical depth from WMAP1 to WMAP3 when the radiative
transfer effects and feedback mechanisms are took into account in computing the
reionization history of the Universe. We also show that a PopIII stellar
cluster with a mass of 80Mo and a heavy Larson initial mass function has an
ionizing efficiency high enough to account for WMAP3 results, while in the case
of WMAP1, a higher stellar mass of 1000Mo was required.",2006-05-15T12:21:18Z
"The surprising magnetic topology of tauSco: fossil remnant or dynamo
  output?","We report the discovery of a medium-strength (~0.5kG) magnetic field on the
young, massive star tauSco (B0.2V), which becomes the third-hottest magnetic
star known. Circularly polarized Zeeman signatures are clearly detected in
observations collected mostly with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter, recently
installed on the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope; temporal variability is
also clearly established in the polarimetry, and can be unambiguously
attributed to rotational modulation with a period close to 41d. Archival UV
spectra confirm that this modulation repeats over timescales of decades.
  By reconstructing the large-scale structure of its magnetic topology, we find
that the magnetic structure is unusually complex for a hot star. The surface
topology is dominated by a potential field, although a moderate toroidal
component is probably present. We fail to detect intrinsic temporal variability
of the magnetic structure over the 1.5-yr period of our spectropolarimetric
observations (in agreement with the stable temporal variations of the UV
spectra), and infer that any differential surface rotation must be very small.
  The topology of the extended magnetic field that we derive from the
photospheric magnetic maps is also more complex than a global dipole, and
features in particular a significantly warped torus of closed magnetic loops
encircling the star (tilted at about 90deg to the rotation axis), with
additional, smaller, networks of closed field lines. This topology appears to
be consistent with the exceptional Xray properties of tauSco and also provides
a natural explanation of the variability observed in wind-formed UV lines. We
conclude that its magnetic field is most probably a fossil remnant from the
star-formation stage.",2006-06-07T15:47:55Z
"Abundance analysis of prime B-type targets for asteroseismology I.
  Nitrogen excess in slowly-rotating beta Cephei stars","We present the results of a detailed NLTE abundance study of nine beta Cephei
stars, all of them being prime targets for theoretical modelling: gamma Peg,
delta Cet, nu Eri, beta CMa, xi1 CMa, V836 Cen, V2052 Oph, beta Cep and DD (12)
Lac. The following chemical elements are considered: He, C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, S
and Fe. Our abundance analysis is based on a large number of time-resolved,
high-resolution optical spectra covering in most cases the entire oscillation
cycle of the stars. Nitrogen is found to be enhanced by up to 0.6 dex in four
stars, three of which have severe constraints on their equatorial rotational
velocity, \Omega R, from seismic or line-profile variation studies: beta Cep
(\Omega R~26 km/s), V2052 Oph (\Omega R~56 km/s), delta Cet (\Omega R < 28
km/s) and xi1 CMa (\Omega R sin i < 10 km/s). The existence of core-processed
material at the surface of such largely unevolved, slowly-rotating objects is
not predicted by current evolutionary models including rotation. We draw
attention to the fact that three stars in this subsample have a detected
magnetic field and briefly discuss recent theoretical work pointing to the
occurrence of diffusion effects in beta Cephei stars possibly capable of
altering the nitrogen surface abundance. On the other hand, the abundances of
all the other chemical elements considered are, within the errors,
indistinguishable from the values found for OB dwarfs in the solar
neighbourhood. Despite the mild nitrogen excess observed in some objects, we
thus find no evidence for a significantly higher photospheric metal content in
the studied beta Cephei stars compared to non-pulsating B-type stars of similar
characteristics.",2006-07-12T17:45:40Z
"Tagging single muons and other long-flying relativistic charged
  particles by ultra-fast timing in air Cherenkov telescopes","Atmospheric air Cherenkov telescopes are successfully used for ground-based,
very high-energy (VHE) gamma ray astronomy. Triggers from the so-called single
muon and other long-flying relativistic charged particle events are an unwanted
background for the Cherenkov telescope. Because of low rate at TeV energies the
muon background is unimportant. It is much more intense for telescopes with
high photon sensitivity and low energy threshold. Below a few hundred GeV
energy, the so-called muon background becomes so intense, that it can
deteriorate the sensitivity of telescopes (the so-called muon-wall problem).
  From general considerations it can be anticipated that the signature of these
particles should be a light pulse with a narrow time structure. In fact,
simulations show that the pulses from muons have a very narrow time profile
that is well below the time resolutions of nearly all currently operating
telescopes. In this report we elaborate on the time profile of Cherenkov light
from the so-called single muons and show that a telescope with ultra-fast time
response can open a new dimension allowing one to tag and to reject those
events.",2006-05-03T13:57:16Z
"On the Relevance of Compton Scattering for the Soft X-ray Spectra of Hot
  DA White Dwarfs","We re-examine the effects of Compton scattering on the emergent spectra of
hot DA white dwarfs in the soft X-ray range. Earlier studies have implied that
sensitive X-ray observations at wavelengths $\lambda < 50$ \AA might be capable
of probing the flux deficits predicted by the redistribution of
electron-scattered X-ray photons toward longer wavelengths. We adopt two
independent numerical approaches to the inclusion of Compton scattering in the
computation of pure hydrogen atmospheres in hydrostatic equilibrium. One
employs the Kompaneets diffusion approximation formalism, while the other uses
the cross-sections and redistribution functions of Guilbert. Models and
emergent spectra are computed for stellar parameters representative of HZ 43
and Sirius B, and for models with an effective temperature $T_{\rm eff} = 100
000$ K. The differences between emergent spectra computed for Compton and
Thomson scattering cases are completely negligible in the case of both HZ 43
and Sirius B models, and are also negligible for all practical purposes for
models with temperatures as high as $T_{\rm eff} = 100 000$ K. Models of the
soft X-ray flux from these stars are instead dominated by uncertainties in
their fundamental parameters.",2006-05-12T14:46:36Z
The effect of giant molecular clouds on star clusters,"We study the encounters between stars clusters and giant molecular clouds
(GMCs). The effect of these encounters has previously been studied analytically
for two cases: 1) head-on encounters, for which the cluster moves through the
centre of the GMC and 2) distant encounters, where the encounter distance p >
3*R_n, with p the encounter parameter and R_n the radius of the GMC. We
introduce an expression for the energy gain of the cluster due to GMC
encounters valid for all values of p and R_n. This analytical result is
confronted with results from N-body simulations and excellent agreement is
found. From the simulations we find that the fractional mass loss is only 25%
of the fractional energy gain. This is because stars escape with velocities
much higher than the escape velocity. Based on the mass loss, we derive a
disruption time for star clusters due to encounters with GMCs of the form t_dis
[Gyr] = 2.0*S*(M_c/10^4 M_sun)^gamma, with S=1 for the solar neighbourhood and
inversely proportional with the global GMC density and gamma=1-3lambda, with
lambda the index that relates the cluster half-mass radius to the cluster mass
(r_h ~ M_c^lambda). The observed shallow relation between cluster radius and
mass (e.g. lambda=0.1), makes the index (gamma=0.7) similar to the index found
both from observations and from simulations of clusters dissolving in tidal
fields (gamma=0.62). The constant of 2.0 Gyr, which is the disruption time of a
10^4 M_sun cluster in the solar neighbourhood, is close to the value of 1.3 Gyr
which was empirically determined from the age distribution of open clusters.
This suggests that the combined effect of GMC encounters, stellar evolution and
galactic tidal field can explain the lack of old open clusters in the solar
neighbourhood.",2006-05-01T10:02:35Z
High frequency observations of southern pulsars,"We present polarization data for 32 mainly southern pulsars at 8.4 GHz. The
observations show that the polarization fraction is low in most pulsars at this
frequency except for the young, energetic pulsars which continue to show
polarization fractions in excess of 60 per cent. All the pulsars in the sample
show evidence for conal emission with only one third also showing core
emission. Many profiles are asymmetric, with either the leading or the trailing
part of cone not detectable. Somewhat surprisingly, the asymmetric profiles
tend to be more polarized than the symmetrical profiles. Little or no pulse
narrowing is seen between 1 and 8.4 GHz. The spectral behaviour of the
orthogonal polarization modes and radius to frequency mapping can likely
account for much of the observational phenomenology. Highly polarized
components may orginate from higher in the magnetosphere than unpolarized
components.",2006-04-19T10:21:03Z
Light Dark Matter Annihilations into Two Photons,"We compute the pair annihilation cross section of light (spin-0) dark matter

On the Origin of HD149026b,"The high density of the close-in extrasolar planet HD149026b suggests the
presence of a huge core in the planet, which challenges planet formation
theory. We first derive constraints on the amount of heavy elements and
hydrogen/helium present in the planet: We find that preferred values of the
core mass are between 50 and 80 M_E. We then investigate the possibility of
subcritical core accretion as envisioned for Uranus and Neptune and find that
the subcritical accretion scenario is unlikely in the case of HD149026b for at
least two reasons: (i) Subcritical planets are such that the ratio of their
core mass to their total mass is above ~0.7, in contradiction with constraints
for all but the most extreme interior models of HD149026b; (ii) High accretion
rates and large isolation mass required for the formation of a subcritical core
of 30 M_E are possible only at specific orbital distances in a disk with a
surface density of dust equal to at least 10 times that of the minimum mass
solar nebula. This value climbs to 30 when considering a 50 M_E core. These
facts point toward two main routes for the formation of this planet: (i) Gas
accretion that is limited by a slow viscous inflow of gas in an evaporating
disk; (ii) A significant modification of the composition of the planet after as
accretion has stopped. These two routes are not mutually exclusive.
Illustrating the second route, we show that for a wide range of impact
parameters, giant impacts lead to a loss of the gas component of the planet and
thus may lead to planets that are highly enriched in heavy elements. In the
giant impact scenario, we expect an outer giant planet to be present.
Observational studies by imaging, astrometry and long term interferometry of
this system are needed to better narrow down the ensemble of possibilities.",2006-07-11T02:59:14Z
"Towards observational constraints on negative (1+z)^4 type contribution
  in the Friedmann equation","We discuss certain issues related to the limitations of density parameters
for a ``radiation''-like contribution to the Friedmann equation using
kinematical or geometrical measurements. We analyse the observational
constraint of a negative $(1+z)^4$-type contribution in cosmological models. We
argue that it is not possible to determine the energy densities of individual
components of matter scaling like radiation from astronomical observations. We
find three different interpretations of the presence of the radiation term: 1)
the FRW universe filled with a massless scalar field in a quantum regime (the
Casimir effect), 2) the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) model in the Randall
Sundrum scenario with dark radiation, 3) the cosmological model with global
rotation. From supernovae type Ia (SNIa) data, Fanaroff-Riley type IIb (FRIIb)
radio galaxy (RG) data, baryon oscillation peak and cosmic microwave background
radiation (CMBR) observations we obtain bounds for the negative radiation-like
term. A small negative contribution of dark radiation can reconcile the tension
in nucleosynthesis and remove also the disagreement between $H_0$ values
obtained from both SNIa and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)
satellite data.",2006-06-29T18:12:36Z
"Diffuse, Non-Thermal X-ray Emission from the Galactic Star Cluster
  Westerlund 1","We present the diffuse X-ray emission identified in Chandra observations of
the young, massive Galactic star cluster Westerlund 1. After removing
point-like X-ray sources down to a completeness limit of 2e31 erg/s, we
identify 3e34 erg/s (2--8 keV) of diffuse emission. The spatial distribution of
the emission can be described as a slightly-elliptical Lorentzian core with a
half-width half-maximum along the major axis of 25+/-1"", similar to the
distribution of point sources in the cluster, plus a 5' halo of extended
emission. The spectrum of the diffuse emission is dominated by a hard continuum
component that can be described as a kT>3 keV thermal plasma that has a low
iron abundance (<0.3 solar), or as non-thermal emission that could be stellar
light that is inverse-Compton scattered by MeV electrons. Only 5% of the flux
is produced by a kT=0.7 keV plasma. The low luminosity of the thermal emission
and the lack of a 6.7 keV iron line suggests that <40,000 unresolved stars with
masses between 0.3 and 2 Msun are present in the cluster. Moreover, the flux in
the diffuse emission is a factor of two lower than would be expected from a
supersonically-expanding cluster wind, and there is no evidence for thermal
remnants produced by supernovae. Less than 1e-5 of the mechanical luminosity of
the cluster is dissipated as 2--8 keV X-rays, leaving a large amount of energy
that either is radiated at other wavelengths, is dissipated beyond the bounds
of our image, or escapes into the intergalactic medium.",2006-06-20T18:47:01Z
3D MHD Simulations of Laboratory Plasma Jets,"Jets and outflows are thought to be an integral part of accretion phenomena
and are associated with a large variety of objects. In these systems, the
interaction of magnetic fields with an accretion disk and/or a magnetized
central object is thought to be responsible for the acceleration and
collimation of plasma into jets and wider angle flows. In this paper we present
three-dimensional MHD simulations of magnetically driven, radiatively cooled
laboratory jets that are produced on the MAGPIE experimental facility. The
general outflow structure comprises an expanding magnetic cavity which is
collimated by the pressure of an extended plasma background medium, and a
magnetically confined jet which develops within the magnetic cavity. Although
this structure is intrinsically transient and instabilities in the jet and
disruption of the magnetic cavity ultimately lead to its break-up, a well
collimated, knotty jet still emerges from the system; such clumpy morphology is
reminiscent of that observed in many astrophysical jets. The possible
introduction in the experiments of angular momentum and axial magnetic field
will also be discussed.",2006-06-30T13:37:39Z
The Age and Metallicity Relation of Omega Centauri,"We present a metallicity distribution based on photometry and spectra for 442
omega Cen cluster members that lie at the main sequence turnoff region of the
color-magnitude diagram. This distribution is similar to that found for the red
giant branch. The distribution shows a sharp rise to a mean of [Fe/H] = -1.7
with a long tail to higher metallicities. Ages have then been determined for
the stars using theoretical isochrones enabling the construction of an
age-metallicity diagram. Interpretation of this diagram is complicated by the
correlation of the errors in the metallicities and ages. Nevertheless, after
extensive Monte-Carlo simulations, we conclude that our data show that the
formation of the cluster took place over an extended period of time: the most
metal-rich stars in our sample ([Fe/H] ~ -0.6) are younger by 2-4 Gyrs than the
most metal-poor population.",2006-05-24T05:48:01Z
A quantum-mechanical study of rotational transitions in H2 induced by H,"Cross sections have been computed for rotational transitions of H2, induced
by collisions with H atoms, using a recent H - H2 potential calculated by
Mielke et al. [1]. These results are compared with those obtained with earlier
potentials. Significant discrepancies are found with results deriving from the
potential of Boothroyd et al. [3] in the low collision energy regime. We
compare also cross sections derived using different levels of approximation to
the vibrational motion.",2006-05-30T10:41:51Z
Measurement of the specific activity of Ar-39 in natural argon,"We report on the measurement of the specific activity of Ar-39 in natural
argon. The measurement was performed with a 2.3-liter two-phase (liquid and
gas) argon drift chamber. The detector was developed by the WARP Collaboration
as a prototype detector for WIMP Dark Matter searches with argon as a target.
The detector was operated for more than two years at Laboratori Nazionali del
Gran Sasso, Italy, at a depth of 3,400 m w.e. The specific activity measured
for Ar-39 is 1.01 +/- 0.02(stat) +/- 0.08(syst) Bq per kg of natural Ar.",2006-03-06T14:19:28Z
"Groups of galaxies: relationship between environment and galaxy
  properties","We analyse how the properties of galaxies in groups identified in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey depend on the environment. In particular, we study the
relationship between galaxy properties and group mass and group-centric
distance. Among the galaxy properties we have considered here, we find that the
$g-r$ colour is the most predictive parameter for group mass, while the most
predictive pair of properties are $g-r$ colour and $r-$band absolute magnitude.
Regarding the position inside the systems, the $g-r$ colour is the best tracer
of group-centric distance and the most predictive pair of properties are $g-r$
colour and spectral type taken together. These results remain unchanged when a
subsample of high mass groups is analysed. The same happens if the brightest
group galaxies are excluded.",2006-05-10T17:05:01Z
Discovery of VHE gamma-ray emission from 1ES1218+30.4,"The MAGIC collaboration has studied the high peaked BL-Lac object
1ES1218+30.4 at a redshift z = 0.182, using the MAGIC imaging air Cherenkov
telescope located on the Canary island of La Palma. A gamma-ray signal was
observed with 6.4sigma significance. The differential energy spectrum for an
energy threshold of 120GeV can be fitted by a simple power law yielding F_E(E)
= (8.1+-2.1)*10^-7 (E/250GeV)^(-3.0+-0.4) TeV^-1 m^-2 s^-1. During the six days
of observation in January 2005 no time variability on time scales of days was
found within the statistical errors. The observed integral flux above 350GeV is
nearly a factor two below the the upper limit reported by the Whipple
Collaboration in 2003.",2006-03-20T16:13:55Z
A non-spherical core in the explosion of supernova SN 2004dj,"An important and perhaps critical clue to the mechanism driving the explosion
of massive stars as supernovae is provided by the accumulating evidence for
asymmetry in the explosion. Indirect evidence comes from high pulsar
velocities, associations of supernovae with long-soft gamma-ray bursts, and
asymmetries in late-time emission-line profiles. Spectropolarimetry provides a
direct probe of young supernova geometry, with higher polarization generally
indicating a greater departure from spherical symmetry. Large polarizations
have been measured for 'stripped-envelope' (that is, type Ic) supernovae, which
confirms their non-spherical morphology; but the explosions of massive stars
with intact hydrogen envelopes (type II-P supernovae) have shown only weak
polarizations at the early times observed. Here we report multi-epoch
spectropolarimetry of a classic type II-P supernova that reveals the abrupt
appearance of significant polarization when the inner core is first exposed in
the thinning ejecta (~90 days after explosion). We infer a departure from
spherical symmetry of at least 30 per cent for the inner ejecta. Combined with
earlier results, this suggests that a strongly non-spherical explosion may be a
generic feature of core-collapse supernovae of all types, where the asphericity
in type II-P supernovae is cloaked at early times by the massive, opaque,
hydrogen envelope.",2006-03-13T01:24:49Z
"On the dipole straylight contamination in spinning space missions
  dedicated to CMB anisotropy","We present an analysis of the dipole straylight contamination (DSC) for
spinning space-missions designed to measure CMB anisotropies. Although this
work is mainly devoted to the {\sc Planck} project, it is relatively general
and allows to focus on the most relevant DSC implications. We first study a
simple analytical model for the DSC in which the pointing direction of the main
spillover can be assumed parallel or not to the spacecraft spin axis direction
and compute the time ordered data and map. The map is then analysed paying
particular attention to the DSC of the low multipole coefficients of the map.
Through dedicated numerical simulations we verify the analytical results and
extend the analysis to higher multipoles and to more complex (and realistic)
cases by relaxing some of the simple assumptions adopted in the analytical
approach. We find that the systematic effect averages out in an even number of
surveys, except for a contamination of the dipole itself that survives when
spin axis and spillover directions are not parallel and for a contamination of
the other multipoles in the case of complex scanning strategies. In particular,
the observed quadrupole can be affected by the DSC in an odd number of surveys
or in the presence of survey uncompleteness or over-completeness. Various
aspects relevant in CMB space projects (such as implications for calibration,
impact on polarization measurements, accuracy requirement in the far beam
knowledge for data analysis applications, scanning strategy dependence) are
discussed.",2006-07-21T16:04:40Z
Analysis to the entangled states from an extended Chaplygin gas model,"With considerations of the recently released WMAP year three and supernova
legacy survey (SNLS) data set analysis that favors models similar to the $%
\Lambda CDM$ model by possibly mild fluctuations around the vacuum energy or
the cosmological constant, we extend the original Chaplygin Gas model (ECG) via
modifying the Chaplygin Gas equation of state by two parameters to describe an
entangled mixture state from an available matter and the rest component (which
can take the cosmological constant or dark energy as in the current cosmic
stage, or `curvature-like' term, or radiation component in the early epoch, as
various phases) coexistence. At low redshifts, the connection of the ECG model
and the Born-infeld field is set up. As paradigms, we use the data coming from
the recently released SNLS for the first year and also the famous 157 type Ia
supernova (Ia SNe) gold dataset to constrain the model parameters. The
restricted results demonstrate clearly how large the entangled degree or the
ratio between the energy density parameters of the two entangled phases being.
The fact that the ECG models are consistent with the observations of Ia SNe is
obtained through the redshift-luminosity distance diagram, hence the ECG can be
regarded possible candidates for mimicking the current speed-up expansion of
our universe.",2006-05-29T08:06:29Z
Radio and millimeter observations of z~2 luminous QSOs,"We present Very Large Array observations at 1.4 and 5 GHz of a sample of 16
quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) at z = 1.78 to 2.71. Half of the chosen quasars
are bright at mm wavelengths (250 or 350 GHz) while the other half were not
detected at mm wavelengths; the former QSOs were detected at 1.4 GHz, in most
cases at high significance (S/N > ~7), but only three of the latter sources
were detected at radio frequencies, and only at lower significance (S/N ~ 3).
The data are consistent with a correlation between the mm and radio fluxes
indicating a physical connection between the mechanisms responsible for the
radio and mm emission. However, this conclusion is based on data which includes
many upper limits, and deeper observations are clearly needed to verify this
correlation.
  All eight mm detected QSOs are detected in the radio continuum, with radio
flux densities consistent with the radio-to-FIR correlation for low z star
forming galaxies. However, four of these have flatter spectral indices than is
typical for star forming galaxies (i.e. greater than -0.5) suggesting that
radiation from the central AGN dominates the observed radio emission. All the
sources detected at 1.4 GHz are spatially unresolved, with the size limits
typically < 1'' = 6 kpc. High star formation rate galaxies at low redshift are
typically nuclear starbursts, with sizes < 1 kpc. Hence, the current radio size
limits are insufficient to constrain the emission model (AGN or starburst).",2006-05-02T23:54:13Z
"GRB 060121: Implications of a Short/Intermediate Duration Gamma-Ray
  Burst at High Redshift","Since the discovery of the first short-hard gamma-ray burst afterglows in
2005, the handful of observed events have been found to be embedded in nearby
(z < 1), bright underlying galaxies. We present multiwavelength observations of
the short-duration burst GRB 060121, which is the first observed to clearly
outshine its host galaxy (by a factor >10^2). A photometric redshift for this
event places the progenitor at a most probable redshift of z = 4.6, with a less
probable scenario of z = 1.7. In either case, GRB 060121 could be the
farthermost short-duration GRB detected to date and implies an
isotropic-equivalent energy release in gamma-rays comparable to that seen in
long-duration bursts. We discuss the implications of the released energy on the
nature of the progenitor. These results suggest that GRB 060121 may belong to a
family of energetic short-duration events, lying at z > 1 and whose optical
afterglows would outshine their host galaxies, unlike the first short-duration
GRBs observed in 2005. The possibility of GRB 060121 being an intermediate
duration burst is also discussed.",2006-05-19T21:44:34Z
"Detection of additional Wolf-Rayet stars in the starburst cluster
  Westerlund 1 with SOAR","We report the detection of 3 additional Wolf-Rayet stars in the young cluster
Westerlund 1. They were selected as emission-line star candidates based on 1
micron narrow-band imaging of the cluster carried out at OPD/LNA (Brazil), and
then confirmed as Wolf-Rayet stars by K-band spectroscopy performed at the 4.1
m SOAR telescope (Chile). Together with previous works, this increases the
population of Wolf-Rayet stars detected in the cluster to 22 members. Moreover,
it is presented for the first time a K-band spectrum of the luminous blue
variable W243, which apparently implies in a higher temperature than that
derived from optical spectra taken in 2003. The WC9 star WR-F was also
observed, showing clear evidence of dust emission in the K-band.",2006-06-20T21:34:11Z
Active Galaxies in the UV,"In this article we present different aspects of AGN studies demonstrating the
importance of the UV spectral range. Most important diagnostic lines for
studying the general physical conditions as well as the metalicities in the
central broad line region in AGN are emitted in the UV. The UV/FUV continuum in
AGN excites not only the emission lines in the immediate surrounding but it is
responsible for the ionization of the intergalactic medium in the early stages
of the universe. Variability studies of the emission line profiles of AGN in
the UV give us information on the structure and kinematics of the immediate
surrounding of the central supermassive black hole as well as on its mass
itself.",2006-04-21T17:19:50Z
Black hole mass and accretion rate of Active Galactic Nuclei,"The determination of the central black hole mass is crucial to the
understanding of AGN physics. In this paper we briefly review some methods that
are currently used to estimate the black hole mass of AGNs. Particularly we
demonstrate the importance of two correlations: one between the black hole mass
and the stellar velocity dispersion and another one between the broad line
region (BLR) size and the optical continuum luminosity. Besides applying these
relations in deriving black hole masses of various types of AGNs, we also
employed the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies to estimate the central
velocity dispersions of AGN host galaxies, and then the black hole masses of
AGNs including BL Lac objects. In addition, we derived another empirical
relation between the BLR size and H_beta emission line luminosity from AGNs
with the BLR size measured by reverberation mapping studies, and argued that
more accurate black hole masses of extremely radio-loud AGNs could be obtained
with it than using the usual R-L_{5100\AA} relation because of the jet
contribution to the optical continuum. Finally we pointed out that black hole
mass estimation is very much helpful to determine the accretion rate and
understand the accretion process in AGNs.",2006-05-05T13:29:11Z
"High Resolution Optical Velocity Fields of 11 Low Surface Brightness
  Galaxies","We present high resolution two-dimensional velocity fields from integral
field spectroscopy along with derived rotation curves for eleven low surface
brightness galaxies. We fit NFW and pseudo-isothermal halo models to the new
data combined with previous long-slit and HI data. In most cases we find the
pseudo-isothermal halo to better represent the data than the NFW halo, as the
NFW concentrations are often lower than expected for a LambdaCDM cosmology. We
also compare our results to previous studies and find that including the new
two-dimensional optical data does not significantly alter the halo parameters,
but does decrease the uncertainties by roughly a factor of 2.",2006-04-27T16:21:58Z
Orientation Angles of a Pulsar's Polarization Vector,"A statistical model of the polarization of pulsar radio emission is used to
derive the general statistics of a polarization vector's orientation angles.
The theoretical distributions are compared with orientation angle histograms
computed from single-pulse, polarization observations of PSR B2020+28. The
favorable agreement between the theoretical and measured distributions lends
support to the underlying assumptions of the statistical model, and
demonstrates, like recent work on other pulsars, that the handedness of
circular polarization is associated with the radiation's orthogonally polarized
modes. Comprehensive directional statistics of the vector's orientation angles
are also derived, and are shown to follow the Watson bipolar and Fisher
distributions in its limiting forms.",2006-03-17T00:36:08Z
"A Search for EUV Emission from Comets with the Cosmic Hot Interstellar
  Plasma Spectrometer (CHIPS)","We have obtained EUV spectra between 90 and 255 \AA of the cometsC/2002 T7
(LINEAR), C/2001 Q4 (NEAT), and C/2004 Q2 (Machholz) near their perihelion
passages in 2004 with the Cosmic Hot Interstellar Plasma Spectrometer (CHIPS).
We obtained contemporaneous data on Comet NEAT Q4 with the $Chandra$ X-ray
Observatory ACIS instrument, marking the first simultaneous EUV and X-ray
spectral observations of a comet. The total CHIPS/EUV observing times were 337
ks for Q4, 234 ks for T7, and 483 ks for Machholz and for both CHIPS and
$Chandra$ we calculate we have captured all the comet flux in the instrument
field of view. We set upper limits on solar wind charge exchange emission lines
of O, C, N, Ne and Fe occurring in the spectral bandpass of CHIPS. The spectrum
of Q4 obtained with $Chandra$ can be reproduced by modeling emission lines of
C, N O, Mg, Fe, Si, S, and Ne solar wind ions. The measured X-ray emission line
intensities are consistent with our predictions from a solar wind charge
exchange model. The model predictions for the EUV emission line intensities are
determined from the intensity ratios of the cascading X-ray and EUV photons
arising in the charge exchange processes. They are compatible with the measured
limits on the intensities of the EUV lines. For comet Q4, we measured a total
X-ray flux of 3.7$\times 10^{-12}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, and derive from
model predictions a total EUV flux of 1.5$\times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$. The CHIPS observations occurred predominantly while the satellite was
on the dayside of Earth. For much of the observing time, CHIPS performed
observations at smaller solar angles than it was designed for and EUV emission
from the Sun scattered into the instrument limited the sensitivity of the EUV
measurements.",2006-06-20T04:10:12Z
"Improved constraints on the cosmological parameters using the VLA FIRST
  survey","Using the final version of the VLA FIRST survey (Becker et al. 2003), the
optical Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 3 (DR3) quasar list and a series
of carefully selected criteria, we have defined the largest homogeneous
population of double-lobed sources. With the precise sample definition, the
increased depth and sensitivity of the survey data, the large size of the
dataset, and our self-consistent method of analysis, which addresses many of
the problems associated with previous work in the area, we are able to: a)
explore the correlations between the intrinsic properties of the double-lobed
radio sources (the results are also confirmed by a non-parametric analysis) and
study their evolution, b) place more interesting and tighter constraints on the
cosmological parameters, distinguish among the different cosmology models, and
determine the impact of the angular size-redshift studies in cosmology, c)
further our understanding of the behavior of the intergalactic medium (IGM)
density as a function of redshift and shed more light to the quasar-radio
galaxy unification issue.",2006-03-20T23:08:20Z
Self-regulated reionization,"Recently, we have presented the first large-scale radiative transfer
simulations of reionization. Here we present new simulations which extend the
source halo mass range downward to 10^8M_solar, to capture the full range of
halo masses thought to be primarily responsible for reionization by their star
formation following atomic hydrogen radiative cooling and gravitational
collapse. Haloes below about 10^9M_solar, however, are subject to Jeans-mass
filtering in the ionized regions, which suppresses their baryonic content and
their ability to release ionizing radiation. By including these smaller-mass
haloes but accounting for their suppression, too, we find that reionization is
``self-regulating,'' as follows. As the mean ionized fraction rises, so does
the fraction of the volume within which suppression occurs. Hence, the degree
of suppression is related to the mean ionized fraction. Since low-mass haloes
with high emissivity achieve a given mean ionized fraction earlier than do
those with low efficiency, Jeans-mass filtering compensates for the difference
in the emissivity of the suppressible haloes in these two cases. As a result,
in the presence of lower-mass source haloes, reionization begins earlier, but
the later stages of reionization and the time of overlap are dictated by the
efficiency of the higher-mass haloes, independent of the efficiency of the
suppressible, lower-mass haloes. Reionization histories consistent with current
observational constraints are shown to be achievable with standard stellar
sources in haloes above 10^8M_solar. Neither minihalos nor exotic sources are
required, and the phenomenon of ``double reionization'' previously suggested
does not occur. (abridged)",2006-07-22T03:30:30Z
"Chandra Observations of Nuclear Outflows in the Elliptical Galaxy
  NGC4552 in the Virgo Cluster","We use a 54.4 ks Chandra observation to study nuclear outflow activity in
NGC4552 (M89), an elliptical galaxy in the Virgo Cluster. Chandra images in the
0.5-2 keV band show two ring-like features ~1.7 kpc in diameter in the core of
NGC4552, as reported previously by Filho et al. We use spherically symmetric
point explosion shock models to argue that the shape of the surface brightness
profile across the rims of the rings and the temperature of hot gas in the
rings are consistent with a Mach 1.7 shock carrying mean mechanical power
L_shock ~ 3 x 10^{41} ergs/s produced by a ~1.4 x 10^{55} ergs nuclear outburst
\~1 - 2 Myr ago. We find the gas temperature in the central ~100 pc of the
galaxy to be 1.0 +/- 0.2 keV, hotter than elsewhere in the galaxy, suggesting
that we may be observing directly the reheating of the galaxy ISM by the
outburst.",2006-04-19T12:58:26Z
"The ATESP 5 GHz radio survey I. Source counts and spectral index
  properties of the faint radio population","[Abridged] The nature and evolutionary properties of the faint radio
population, responsible for the steepening observed in the 1.4 GHz source
counts below 1 milliJy, are not yet entirely clear. Radio spectral indices may
help to constrain the origin of the radio emission in such faint radio sources
and may be fundamental in understanding eventual links to the optical light. We
study the spectral index behaviour of sources that were found in the 1.4 GHz
ATESP survey (Prandoni et al. 2000a,b). Using the Australia Telescope Compact
Array we observed at 5 GHz part of the region covered by the sub-mJy ATESP
survey. In particular we imaged a one square degree area for which deep optical
imaging in UBVRIJK is available. In this paper we present the 5 GHz survey and
source catalogue, we derive the 5 GHz source counts and we discuss the 1.4-5
GHz spectral index properties of the ATESP sources. The analysis of the optical
properties of the sample will be the subject of a following paper. The 5 GHz
survey has produced a catalogue of 111 radio sources, complete down to a (6
sigma) limit S_lim(5 GHz)~0.4 mJy. We take advantage of the better spatial
resolution at 5 GHz (~2 arcsec compared to ~8 arcsec at 1.4 GHz) to infer radio
source structures and sizes. The 5 GHz source counts derived by the present
sample are consistent with those reported in the literature, but improve
significantly the statistics in the flux range 0.4< S(5 GHz)<1 mJy. The ATESP
sources show a flattening of the 1.4-5 GHz spectral index with decreasing flux
density, which is particularly significant for the 5 GHz selected sample. Such
a flattening confirm previous results coming from smaller samples and is
consistent with a flattening of the 5 GHz source counts occurring at fluxes
<=0.5 mJy.",2006-07-07T16:50:02Z
Remarkable non-dipolar magnetic field of the Bp star HD 137509,"The southern magnetic Bp star HD 137509 exhibits complex rotational
modulation of the longitudinal field and other magnetic observables.
Interpretation of this magnetic variability in the framework of the low-order
multipolar field models suggests a very strong quadrupolar component to
dominate the surface field topology of HD 137509. I have examined the
high-quality VLT/UVES spectra of HD 137509 and discovered resolved Zeeman split
components in some of the spectral lines. The inferred mean surface field
modulus, <B>=29 kG, agrees with the multipolar model predictions. This confirms
the presence of an extremely strong non-dipolar magnetic field in HD 137509 and
establishes this star as the object with the second-largest field among
magnetic chemically peculiar stars.",2006-03-30T20:21:44Z
"Semi-empirical analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies III. How to
  distinguish AGN hosts","We consider the techniques to distinguish normal star forming (NSF) galaxies
and active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosts using optical spectra. The observational
data base is a set of 20000 galaxies extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey, for which we have determined the emission line intensities after
subtracting the stellar continuum obtained from spectral synthesis. Our
analysis is based on photoionization models computed using the stellar ionizing
radiation predicted by Starburst 99 and, for the AGNs, a broken power-law
spectrum. We explain why, among the four classical emission line diagnostic
diagrams, the [OIII]/Hb vs [NII]/Ha one works best. We show however, that none
of these diagrams is efficient in detecting AGNs in metal poor galaxies, should
such cases exist. We propose a new divisory line between ``pure'' NSF galaxies
and AGN hosts. We also show that a classification into NSF and AGN galaxies
using only [NII]/Ha is feasible and useful. Finally, we propose a new
classification diagram, the DEW diagram, plotting D_n(4000) vs
max(EW[OII],EW[NeIII]). This diagram can be used with optical spectra for
galaxies with redshifts up to z = 1.3, meaning an important progress over
classifications proposed up to now. Since the DEW diagram requires only a small
range in wavelength, it can also be used at even larger redshifts in suitable
atmospheric windows. It also has the advantage of not requiring stellar
synthesis analysis to subtract the stars and of allowing one to see ALL the
galaxies in the same diagram, including passive galaxies.",2006-06-29T14:39:20Z
"Study of time lags in HETE-2 Gamma-Ray Bursts with redshift: search for
  astrophysical effects and Quantum Gravity signature","The study of time lags between spikes in Gamma-Ray Burst light curves in
different energy bands as a function of redshift may lead to the detection of
effects due to Quantum Gravity. We present an analysis of 15 Gamma-Ray Bursts
with measured redshift, detected by the HETE-2 mission in order to measure time
lags related to astrophysical effects and search for Quantum Gravity signature
in the framework of an extra-dimension string model. The wavelet transform
method is used both for de-noising the light curves and for the detection of
sharp transitions. The use of photon tagged data allows us to consider various
energy ranges and to evaluate systematic effects due to selections and cuts.
The analysis of maxima and minima of the light curves leads to no significant
Quantum Gravity effect. A lower limit at 95% Confidence Level on the Quantum
Gravity scale parameter of 2x10**15 GeV is set.",2006-03-27T14:39:01Z
The Influence of Large-Scale Structure on Halo Shapes and Alignments,"Alignments of galaxy clusters (the Binggeli effect), as well as of galaxies
themselves have long been studied both observationally and theoretically. Here
we test the influence of large-scales structures and tidal fields on the shapes
and alignments of cluster-size and galaxy-size dark matter halos. We use a
high-resolution N-body simulation of a $\Lambda$CDM universe, together with the
results of Colberg et al. (2005), who identified filaments connecting pairs of
clusters. We find that cluster pairs connected by a filament are strongly
aligned with the cluster-cluster axis, whereas unconnected ones are not. For
smaller, galaxy-size halos, there also is an alignment signal, but its strength
is independent of whether the halo is part of an obvious large-scale structure.
Additionally, we find no measureable dependence of galaxy halo shape on
membership of a filament. We also quantify the influence of tidal fields and
find that these do correlate strongly with alignments of halos. The alignments
of most halos are thus caused by tidal fields, with cluster-size halos being
strongly aligned through the added mechanism of infall of matter from
filaments.",2006-05-11T16:20:49Z
"Contribution of GRB Emission to the GeV Extragalactic Diffuse Gamma-Ray
  Flux","TeV gamma rays emitted by GRBs are converted into electron-positron pairs via
interactions with the extragalactic infrared radiation fields. In turn the
pairs produced, whose trajectories are randomized by magnetic fields, will
inverse Compton scatter off the cosmic microwave background photons. The beamed
TeV gamma ray flux from GRBs is thus transformed into a GeV isotropic gamma ray
flux, which contributes to the total extragalactic gamma-ray background
emission. Assuming a model for the extragalactic radiation fields, for the GRB
redshift distribution and for the GRB luminosity function, we evaluate the
contribution of the GRB prompt and scattered emissions to the measured
extragalactic gamma-ray flux. To estimate this contribution we optimistically
require that the energy flux at TeV energies is about 10 times stronger than
the energy flux at MeV energies. The resulting gamma-ray diffuse background is
only a small fraction of what is observed, allowing blazars and other sources
to give the dominant contribution.",2006-06-29T02:07:19Z
Galaxy Galaxy Lensing as a Probe of Galaxy Dark Matter Halos,"Gravitational lensing has now become a popular tool to measure the mass
distribution of structures in the Universe on various scales. Here we focus on
the study of galaxy's scale dark matter halos with galaxy-galaxy lensing
techniques: observing the shapes of distant background galaxies which have been
lensed by foreground galaxies allows us to map the mass distribution of the
foreground galaxies. The lensing effect is small compared to the intrinsic
ellipticity distribution of galaxies, thus a statistical approach is needed to
derive some constraints on an average lens population. An advantage of this
method is that it provides a probe of the gravitational potential of the halos
of galaxies out to very large radii, where few classical methods are viable,
since dynamical and hydrodynamical tracers of the potential cannot be found at
this radii. We will begin by reviewing the detections of galaxy-galaxy lensing
obtained so far. Next we will present a maximum likelihood analysis of
simulated data we performed to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of
constraints that can be obtained on galaxy halo properties. Then we will apply
this method to study the properties of galaxies which stand in massive cluster
lenses at z~0.2. The main result of this work is to find dark matter halos of
cluster galaxies to be significantly more compact compared to dark matter halos
around field galaxies of equivalent luminosity, in agreement with early
galaxy-galaxy lensing studies and with theoretical expectations, in particular
with the tidal stripping scenario. We thus provide a strong confirmation of
tidal truncation from a homogeneous sample of galaxy clusters. Moreover, it is
the first time that cluster galaxies are probed successfully using
galaxy-galaxy lensing techniques from ground based data.",2006-06-19T13:59:44Z
On the X-ray Baldwin effect for narrow Fe Kalpha emission line,"Most Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) exhibit a narrow Fe Kalpha line at ~ 6.4
keV in the X-ray spectra, due to the fluorescent emission from cold material
far from the inner accretion disk. Using XMM-Newton observations, Page et al.
found that the equivalent width (EW) of the narrow Fe Kalpha line decreases
with increasing luminosity (EW ~ L^-0.17pm0.08), suggesting a decrease in the
covering factor of the material emitting the line (presumably the torus). By
combining the archival Chandra HETG observations of 34 type 1 AGNs with XMM
observations in literature, we build a much large sample with 101 AGNs. We find
a similar X-ray Baldwin effect in the sample (EW ~ L^-0.2015pm0.0426), however,
we note that the anti-correlation is dominated by the radio loud AGN in the
sample, whose X-ray spectra might be contaminated by the relativistic jet.
Excluding the radio loud AGN, we find a much weaker anti-correlation (EW ~
L^-0.1019pm0.0524). We present Monte-Carlo simulations showing that such a weak
anti-correlation can be attributed to the relative short time scale variations
of the X-ray continuum.",2006-03-14T06:55:01Z
Compton Spectrum from Poynting Flux Accelerated e+e- Plasma,"We report the Compton scattering emission from the Poynting flux acceleration

Poynting flux acceleration and Compton spectral output, and discuss the
agreement with the observed spectra of GRBs and XRFs.",2006-04-18T23:28:55Z
"Damping and excitation variations of the solar acoustic modes using LOWL
  observations","We have used observations made with the helioseismic instrument LOWL
collected over $\sim$ 6 years to carry out an independent study of the
variations of the p-mode damping and excitation rates with solar activity. We
observe significant variations in the mode height, mode width and mode velocity
power over a wide range of angular degree values. Their sensitivities to solar
activity show clear evidence of frequency dependence, the modes in the
frequency range from 2700 and 3300 $\mu$Hz showing the largest variations and
exhibiting a maximum change centered around 3100 $\mu$Hz. As for the mode
energy supply rate, it is consistent, at the level of precision of the
observations, with a zero change along the solar cycle and over the range of
studied frequencies. Moreover, the variations with solar activity of each of
these parameters are observed to be more or less $\ell$-independent over the
range of studied angular degrees. Our results provide the first in-depth
confirmation of the findings obtained from GONG measurements for intermediate
angular degrees.",2006-07-15T02:37:03Z
"Direct Dark Matter Detection with Velocity Distribution in the Eddington
  approach","Exotic dark matter together with the vacuum energy (associated with the
cosmological constant) seem to dominate the Universe. Thus its direct detection
is central to particle physics and cosmology. Supersymmetry provides a natural
dark matter candidate, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). One
essential ingredient in obtaining the direct detection rates is the density and
the velocity distribution of the LSP in our vicinity. In the present paper we
study simultaneously density profiles and velocity distributions in the context
of the Eddington approach. In such an approach, unlike the commonly assumed
Maxwell-Boltzmann (M-B) distribution, the upper bound of the velocity arises
naturally from the potential.",2006-03-26T07:29:15Z
Oscillations in the stable starless core Barnard 68,"New molecular line observations of the Bok globule Barnard 68 in HCO+
irrefutably confirm the complex pattern of red and blue asymmetric line
profiles seen across the face of the cloud in previous observations of CS. The
new observations thus strengthen the previous interpretation that Barnard 68 is
undergoing peculiar oscillations. Furthermore, the physical chemistry of B68
indicates that the object is much older than the sound crossing time and is
therefore long-lived. A model is presented for the globule in which a modest
external pressure perturbation is shown to lead to oscillations about a stable
equilibrium configuration. Such oscillations may be present in other stable
starless cores as manifested by a similar signature of inward and outward
motions.",2006-04-04T14:17:30Z
"Toward Understanding the origin of the Fundamental Plane for Early-Type
  Galaxies","We present a panoramic review of several observational and theoretical
aspects of the modern astrophysical research about the origin of the
Fundamental Plane (FP) relation for Early-Type Galaxies (ETGs). The discussion
is focused on the problem of the tilt and the tightness of the FP, and on the
attempts to derive the luminosity evolution of ETGs with redshift. Finally, a
number of observed features in the FP are interpreted from the standpoint of a
new theoretical approach based on the two-component tensor virial theorem.",2006-06-16T11:16:42Z
Infrared Imaging of Planetary Nebulae from the Ground Up,"New ground-based telescopes and instruments, the return of the NICMOS

study of planetary nebulae. Multiwavelength, high spatial resolution
ground-based and HST imaging have been used to probe the inner regions of young
PNe to determine their structure and evaluate formation mechanisms.

Hypernova Signatures in the Late Rebrightening of GRB 050525A,"We report observations of GRB 050525A, for which a Gemini North spectrum
shows its redshift to be z = 0.606. This is the third closest long GRB
discovered by Swift. We observed its afterglow using the VLT, Gemini and TNG
telescopes to search for an associated SN. We find that the early-time light
curve is described by a broken power law with a break at t ~ 0.3 d after the
burst. About 5 d after the burst, a flattening is apparent, followed by a
further dimming. Both the magnitude and the shape of the light curve suggest
that a supernova was emerging during the late decay of the afterglow. This
supernova, dubbed SN 2005nc, had a rise time faster than SN 1998bw and a
long-lasting maximum. A spectrum obtained about 20 d (rest-frame) after the GRB
resembles the spectrum of SN 1998bw obtained close to maximum light.",2006-04-05T19:31:49Z
"Variable Very High Energy Gamma-ray Emission from the Microquasar LS I
  +61 303","Microquasars are binary star systems with relativistic radio-emitting jets.
They are potential sources of cosmic rays and laboratories for elucidating the
physics of relativistic jets. Here we report the detection of variable
gamma-ray emission above 100 gigaelectron volts from the microquasar LS I +61
303. Six orbital cycles were recorded. Several detections occur at a similar
orbital phase, suggesting the emission is periodic. The strongest gamma-ray
emission is not observed when the two stars are closest to one another,
implying a strong orbital modulation of the emission or the absorption
processes.",2006-05-22T08:43:03Z
Improved 3D Fabry-Perot Data Reduction Techniques,"Improved data reduction techniques for 3D data cubes obtained from
Fabry-Perot integral field spectroscopy are presented. They provide accurate
sky emission subtraction and adaptive spatial binning and smoothing. They help
avoiding the effect analogous to the beam smearing, seen in HI radio data, when
strong smoothing is applied to 3D data in order to get the most extended signal
coverage. The data reduction techniques presented in this paper allow one to
get the best of both worlds: high spatial resolution in high signal-to-noise
regions and large spatial coverage in low signal-to-noise regions.",2006-03-24T21:00:32Z
The dark matter halos of the bluest low surface brightness galaxies,"We present BVI photometry and long-slit Halpha rotation curve data obtained
with ESO VLT/FORS2 for six low surface brightness galaxies with extremely blue
colours and very faint central regions. We find no evidence for a steep central
density cusp of the type predicted by many N-body simulations of cold dark
matter (CDM) halos. Our observations are instead consistent with dark matter
halos characterized by cores of roughly constant density, in agreement with
previous investigations. While unremarkable in terms of the central density
slope, these galaxies appear very challenging for existing CDM halo models in
terms of average central halo density, as measured by the Delta_(V/2)
parameter. Since most of our target galaxies are bulgeless disks, our
observations also disfavour a recently suggested mechanism for lowering the
central mass concentration of the halo by means of a fast collapse phase, as
this scenario predicts that the original CDM profile should still be detectable
in bulgeless galaxies. Other potential ways of reconciling the CDM predictions
with these observations are discussed.",2006-03-20T10:21:55Z
Cosmology and the Bispectrum,"The present spatial distribution of galaxies in the Universe is non-Gaussian,
with 40% skewness in 50 Mpc/h spheres, and remarkably little is known about the
information encoded in it about cosmological parameters beyond the power
spectrum. In this work we present an attempt to bridge this gap by studying the
bispectrum, paying particular attention to a joint analysis with the power
spectrum and their combination with CMB data. We address the covariance
properties of the power spectrum and bispectrum including the effects of beat
coupling that lead to interesting cross-correlations, and discuss how baryon
acoustic oscillations break degeneracies. We show that the bispectrum has
significant information on cosmological parameters well beyond its power in
constraining galaxy bias, and when combined with the power spectrum is more
complementary than combining power spectra of different samples of galaxies,
since non-Gaussianity provides a somewhat different direction in parameter
space. In the framework of flat cosmological models we show that most of the
improvement of adding bispectrum information corresponds to parameters related
to the amplitude and effective spectral index of perturbations, which can be
improved by almost a factor of two. Moreover, we demonstrate that the expected
statistical uncertainties in sigma8 of a few percent are robust to relaxing the
dark energy beyond a cosmological constant.",2006-04-24T21:26:37Z
VLBI Images of 49 Radio Supernovae in Arp 220,"We have used a Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) array at 18cm
wavelength to image the nucleus of the luminous IR galaxy Arp 220 at ~1 pc
linear resolution, and with very high sensitivity. The resulting map has an rms
of 5.5 microJy/beam, and careful image analysis results in 49 confirmed point
sources ranging in flux density from 1.2 mJy down to ~60 microJy. Comparison
with high sensitivity data from 12 months earlier reveals at least four new
sources. The favored interpretation of these sources is that they are radio
supernovae, and if all new supernovae are detectable at this sensitivity, a
resulting estimate of the supernova rate in the Arp 220 system is 4 +/- 2 per
year. The implied star formation rate is sufficient to power the entire
observed far-infrared luminosity of the galaxy. The two nuclei of Arp 220
exhibit striking similarities in their radio properties, though the western
nucleus is more compact, and appears to be ~3 times more luminous than the
eastern nucleus. There are also some puzzling differences, and differential
free-free absorption, synchrotron aging and expansion losses may all be playing
a role. Comparison with the nearby starburst galaxy M82 supports the hypothesis
that the activity in Arp 220 is essentially a scaled-up version of that in M82.",2006-04-27T17:00:10Z
Cleaning up Eta Carinae: Detection of Ammonia in the Homunculus,"We report the first detection of ammonia in the Homunculus nebula around eta
Carinae, which is also the first detection of emission from a polyatomic
molecule in this or any other luminous blue variable (LBV) nebula. Observations
of the NH3 (J,K)=(3,3) inversion transition made with the Australia Telescope
Compact Array reveal emission at locations where infrared H2 emission had been
detected previously, near the strongest dust emission in the core of the
Homunculus. We also detect ammonia emission from the so-called ``strontium
filament'' in the equatorial disk. The presence of NH3 around eta Car hints
that molecular shells around some Wolf-Rayet stars could have originated in
prior LBV eruptions, rather than in cool red supergiant winds or the ambient
interstellar medium. Combined with the lack of any CO detection, NH3 seems to
suggest that the Homunculus is nitrogen rich like the ionized ejecta around eta
Car. It also indicates that the Homunculus is a unique laboratory in which to
study unusual molecule and dust chemistry, as well as their rapid formation in
a nitrogen-rich environment around a hot star. We encourage future observations
of other transitions like NH3 (1,1) and (2,2), related molecules like N2H+, and
renewed attempts to detect CO.",2006-05-22T00:07:04Z
Averaging Spherically Symmetric Spacetimes in General Relativity,"We discuss the averaging problem in general relativity, using the form of the
macroscopic gravity equations in the case of spherical symmetry in volume
preserving coordinates. In particular, we calculate the form of the correlation
tensor under some reasonable assumptions on the form for the inhomogeneous
gravitational field and matter distribution. On cosmological scales, the
correlation tensor in a Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW)
background is found to be of the form of a spatial curvature. On astrophysical
scales the correlation tensor can be interpreted as the sum of a spatial
curvature and an anisotropic fluid. We briefly discuss the physical
implications of these results.",2006-06-21T20:11:41Z
"Multiwavelength Observations of EXO 0748--676 -- II. Emission Line
  Behavior","We present optical and ultraviolet spectra, lightcurves, and Doppler
tomograms of the low-mass X-ray binary EXO 0748-676. Using an extensive set of
15 emission line tomograms, we show that, along with the usual emission from
the stream and ``hot spot'', there is extended non-axisymmetric emission from
the disk rim. Some of the emission and Halpha and beta absorption features lend
weight to the hypothesis that part of the stream overflows the disk rim and
forms a two phase medium. The data are consistent with a 1.35M_sun neutron star
with a main sequence companion and hence a mass ratio q~0.34.",2006-05-24T18:00:06Z
"Mapping stellar kinematics across the Galactic bar: HST measurements of
  proper motions in 35 fields","We present a proper motion mini-survey of 35 fields in the vicinity of Baade
window, (l, b) = (1 deg, -4 deg), sampling roughly a 5 x 2.5 deg region of the
Galactic bar. Our second epoch observations collected with the ACS/HRC
instrument on board the Hubble Space Telescope were combined with the archival
WFPC2/PC images. The resulting time baselines are in the range of 4 - 8 years.
Precise proper motions of 15,863 stars were determined in the reference frame
defined by the mean motion of stars with magnitudes between I_F814W = 16.5 -
21.5 along the line of sight. We clearly detect small gradients in proper
motion dispersions (sigma_l, sigma_b) ~ (3.0, 2.5) mas/yr, and in the amount of
anisotropy (sigma_l/sigma_b ~ 1.2). Both the longitude dispersion sigma_l and
its ratio to the vertical motion sigma_b increase toward the Galactic plane.
The decline of the anisotropy ratio sigma_l/sigma_b toward the minor axis of
the bulge is mostly due to increasing sigma_b. We also find, for the first
time, a significant negative covariance term in the transverse velocity field
sigma_lb/(sigma_l*sigma_b) ~ -0.10. Our results extend by a factor of ~15 the
number of the Galactic bar fields with good proper motion dispersions.",2006-04-26T17:48:58Z
"X-ray thermal coronae of galaxies in hot clusters -- ubiquity of
  embedded mini cooling cores","We present a systematic investigation of X-ray thermal coronae in 157
early-type galaxies and 22 late-type galaxies from a survey of 25 hot (kT>3
keV), nearby (z<0.05) clusters, based on CHANDRA archival data. Cool galactic
coronae (kT=0.5-1.1 keV generally) have been found to be very common, >60% in
NIR selected galaxies that are more luminous than 2L*, and >40% in L* < L_Ks <
2L* galaxies. These embedded coronae in hot clusters are generally smaller
(1.5-4 kpc radii), less luminous (<~ 10^41 erg s^-1), and less massive
(10^6.5-10^8 M_solar}) than coronae in poor environments, demonstrating the
negative effects of hot cluster environments on galactic coronae. Nevertheless,
these coronae still manage to survive ICM stripping, evaporation, rapid
cooling, and powerful AGN outflows, making them a rich source of information
about gas stripping, microscopic transport, and feedback processes in the
cluster environment. Heat conduction across the boundary of the coronae has to
be suppressed by a factor of >100, which implies the X-ray gas in early-type
galaxies is magnetized and the magnetic field plays an important role in energy
transfer. Stripping through transport processes (viscosity or turbulence) also
needs to be suppressed by at least a factor of ten at the coronal boundary...
(abridged) Diffuse thermal coronae have also been detected in at least 8 of 22
late-type (Sb or later) galaxies in our sample. Evidence for enhanced star
formation triggered by the ICM pressure has been found in four late-type
galaxies. The fraction of luminous X-ray AGN (>10^41 ergs s^-1) is not small (~
5%) in our sample.",2006-06-08T03:49:57Z
"The VLT-FLAMES survey of massive stars: Mass loss and rotation of
  early-type stars in the SMC","We have studied the optical spectra of a sample of 31 O- and early B-type
stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, 21 of which are associated with the young
massive cluster NGC 346. Stellar parameters are determined using an automated
fitting method. Comparison with predictions of stellar evolution that account
for stellar rotation does not result in a unique age, though most stars are
best represented by an age of 1-3 Myr. The present day v_sini distribution of
the 21 dwarf stars in our sample is consistent with an underlying rotational
velocity (v_r) distribution that can be characterised by a mean velocity of
about 160-190 km/s and an effective half width of 100-150 km/s. The v_r
distribution must include a small percentage of slowly rotating stars. If
predictions of the time evolution of the equatorial velocity for massive stars
within the environment of the SMC are correct, the young age of the cluster
implies that this underlying distribution is representative for the initial
rotational velocity distribution. The location in the Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram of the stars showing helium enrichment is in qualitative agreement with
evolutionary tracks accounting for rotation, but not for those ignoring v_r.
The mass loss rates of the SMC objects having luminosities of log L/L_sun > 5.4
are in excellent agreement with predictions. However, for lower luminosity
stars the winds are too weak to determine M_dot accurately from the optical
spectrum. Two of three spectroscopically classified Vz stars from our sample
are located close to the theoretical zero age main sequence, as expected.",2006-06-16T12:53:55Z
Galaxy luminosity function per morphological type up to z=1.2,"We have computed the evolution of the rest-frame B-band luminosity function
(LF) for bulge and disk-dominated galaxies since z=1.2. We use a sample of 605
spectroscopic redshifts with I_{AB}<24 in the Chandra Deep Field South from the
VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey, 3555 galaxies with photometric redshifts from the
COMBO-17 multi-color data, coupled with multi-color HST/ACS images from the
Great Observatories Origin Deep Survey. We split the sample in bulge- and
disk-dominated populations on the basis of asymmetry and concentration
parameters measured in the rest-frame B-band. We find that at z=0.4-0.8, the LF
slope is significantly steeper for the disk-dominated population (\alpha=-1.19
\pm 0.07) compared to the bulge-dominated population (\alpha=-0.53 \pm 0.13).
The LF of the bulge-dominated population is composed of two distinct
populations separated in rest-frame color: 68% of red (B-I)_{AB}>0.9 and bright
galaxies showing a strongly decreasing LF slope \alpha=+0.55 \pm 0.21, and 32%
of blue (B-I)_{AB}<0.9 and more compact galaxies which populate the LF
faint-end. We observe that red bulge-dominated galaxies are already well in
place at z~1, but the volume density of this population is increasing by a
factor 2.7 between z~1 and z~0.6. It may be related to the building-up of
massive elliptical galaxies in the hierarchical scenario. In addition, we
observe that the blue bulge-dominated population is dimming by 0.7 magnitude
between z~1 and z~0.6. Galaxies in this faint and more compact population could
possibly be the progenitors of the local dwarf spheroidal galaxies.",2006-04-02T00:47:49Z
"Does Radiative Feedback by the First Stars Promote or Prevent Second
  Generation Star Formation?","We study the effect of starlight from the first stars on the ability of other
minihaloes in their neighborhood to form additional stars. The question of what
the dynamical consequences were for these target minihaloes, of their exposure
to the ionizing and dissociating starlight from the Pop III star requires a
full radiation-hydrodynamics calculation. Towards this end, we have performed a
series of detailed, 1D, radiation-hydrodynamical simulations. We have varied
the distance to the source (and, hence, the flux) and the mass and evolutionary
stage of the target haloes to quantify this effect. We find: (1) trapping of
the I-front and its transformation from R-type to D-type, preceded by a shock
front; (2) photoevaporation of the ionized gas (i.e. all gas originally located
outside the trapping radius); (3) formation of an H_2 precursor shell which
leads the I-front, stimulated by partial photoionization; and (4) the
shock-induced formation of H_2 in the minihalo neutral core when the shock
speeds up and partially ionizes the gas. The fate of the neutral core is mostly
determined by the response of the core to this shock front, which leads to
molecular cooling and collapse that, when compared to the same halo without
external radiation, is either: (a) expedited, (b) delayed, (c) unaltered, or
(d) reversed or prevented, depending upon the flux (i.e. distance to the
source) and the halo mass and evolutionary stage. Roughly speaking, most haloes
that were destined to cool, collapse, and form stars in the absence of external
radiation are found to do so even when exposed to the first Pop III star in
their neighborhood, while those that would not have done so are still not able
to. (abridged)",2006-07-28T12:39:01Z
Coronal emission from the shocked circumstellar ring of SN 1987A,"High resolution spectra with UVES/VLT of SN 1987A from December 2000 until
November 2005 show a number of high ionization lines from gas with velocities
of roughly 350 km/s, emerging from the shocked gas formed by the ejecta-ring
collision. These include coronal lines from [Fe X], [Fe XI] and [Fe XIV] which
have increased by a factor of about 20 during the observed period. The
evolution of the lines is similar to that of the soft X-rays, indicating that
they arise in the same component. The line ratios are consistent with those
expected from radiative shocks with velocity 310-390 km/s, corresponding to a
shock temperature of (1.6-2.5) x 10^6 K. A fraction of the coronal emission
may, however, originate in higher velocity adiabatic shocks.",2006-03-30T10:24:59Z
Microquasar hadronic jets at very high-energy gamma-rays,"Microquasars (MQs) present emission over the whole spectrum, from radio
wavelengths to gamma-rays. The microquasar spectral energy distribution is very
complex, being a signature of the different physical processes that generate
the radiation emitted by these objects. In this work, we estimate the amount of
broad-band emission produced by relativistic protons, released from the jet of
a MQ, interacting with high density regions of the ISM. We show that a two
components source, the microquasar itself and the region of interaction between
the jets and the ISM, could be unveiled by the new instruments at high-energy
and very high-energy gamma-rays.",2006-05-18T18:28:11Z
Environmental Effects on Galaxy Evolution Based on the SDSS,"We have constructed a large, uniform galaxy cluster catalog from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey data. By studying the morphology--cluster-centric-radius
relation, we have found two characteristic environments where galaxy
morphologies change dramatically, indicating there exist two different physical
mechanisms responsible for the cluster galaxy evolution. We also found an
unusual population of galaxies, which have spiral morphology but do not have
any emission lines, indicating these spiral galaxies do not have any on-going
star formation activity. More interestingly, these passive spiral galaxies
preferentially exist in the cluster outskirts. Therefore, these passive spiral
galaxies are likely to be a key galaxy population being transformed from blue,
star-forming galaxies into red, early-type galaxies.",2006-05-09T01:25:51Z
"Unification scheme and the distribution of neutral gas in compact radio
  sources","We examine the consistency of HI properties with the unification scheme for
radio galaxies and quasars, and any correlation with the symmetry parameters
for a sample of CSS and GPS sources. In our sample, 15 out of 23 galaxies
exhibit 21-cm absorption as against 1 out of 9 quasars, which is broadly
consistent with the unification scheme. Also there is a tendency for the
detection rate as well as the column density for galaxies to increase with core
prominence, f_c, a statistical indicator of the orientation of the jet axis to
the line of sight. This can be understood in a scenario where radio sources are
larger than the scale of the circumnuclear HI disk so that the lines of sight
to the lobes at very large inclinations do not intersect the disk. The sources
in our sample also exhibit the known anti-correlation between HI column density
and source size. This suggests that small linear size, along with intermediate
values of core prominence, is a good recipe for detecting 21-cm absorption in
CSS and GPS objects. Some of the absorption could also be arising from clouds
which may have interacted with the radio jet. The HI column density and
velocity shift of the primary absorption component, however, show no dependence
on the degree of misalignment and the separation ratio of the radio sources.",2006-05-17T19:28:01Z
"Masses of Astrometrically-Discovered and Imaged Binaries: G 78-28AB and
  GJ 231.1BC","The Stellar Planet Survey (STEPS) is an ongoing astrometric search for giant
planets and brown dwarfs around a sample of ~30 M-dwarfs. We have discovered
several low-mass companions by measuring the motion of our target stars
relative to their reference frames. The highest mass discovery thus far is G
78-28B, a companion to the M-dwarf G 78-28A. The orbital period is 4.18 +/-
0.03 y, the system mass is 0.565 +/- 0.055 Msolar, and the semi-major axis is
2.19 +/- 0.10 AU. Imaging observations with the Keck laser guide star adaptive
optics (LGSAO) and the Palomar AO instruments resolved the system and also
yielded JHK-band delta magnitudes. We use the orbital solution, light ratios,
and mass-luminosity relationships to derive component masses of MA = 0.370 +/-
0.034 Msolar and MB = 0.195 +/- 0.021 Msolar. G 78-28B is of type M4 V based
upon its colors and mass. We also discovered GJ 231.1C, a companion to GJ
231.1B, with STEPS and imaged the companion with LGSAO and Palomar AO, but the
orbital period is longer than our observing baseline; thus the system
parameters are less constrained. In GJ 231.1BC the masses are MB = 0.25 +/-
0.06 Msolar and MC =0.12 +/- 0.02 Msolar. The inferred spectral type of GJ
231.1C is M5 V. We demonstrate the results of the current state of mass
estimation techniques with our data.",2006-05-11T22:03:50Z
"The RMS Survey: Radio observations of candidate massive YSOs in the
  southern hemisphere","The Red MSX Source (RMS) survey is a multi-wavelength program of follow-up
observations designed to distinguish between genuine massive young stellar
objects (MYSOs) and other embedded or dusty objects, such as ultra compact (UC)
HII regions, evolved stars and planetary nebulae (PNe). We have identified
nearly 2000 massive YSOs candidates by comparing the colours of MSX and 2MASS
point sources to those of known MYSOs. Unfortunately, there are several other
types of embedded or dust enshrouded objects that have similar colours as MYSOs
and contaminate our sample. Two sources of contamination are from UCHII regions
and PNe, both of which can be identified from the radio emission emitted by
their ionised nebulae. In order to identify UCHII regions and PNe that
contaminate our sample we have conducted high resolution radio continuum
observations at 3.6 and 6 cm of all southern MYSOs candidates ($235< l < 350$)
using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). These observations have a
spatial resolution of $\sim$1--2\arcsec and typical image rms noise values of
$\sim$0.3 mJy -- sensitive enough to detect a B0.5 star at the far side of the
Galaxy. Of the 826 RMS sources observed we found 199 to be associated with
radio emission, $\sim$25% of the sample. More significant than those sources
associated with radio emission are the 627 RMS sources for which no radio
emission was detected as these sources are still potential MYSOs. The Galactic
distribution, morphologies and spectral indices of the radio sources associated
with the RMS sources are consistent with these sources being UCHII regions. In
addition to the 826 RMS sources observed we present observations of a further
190 fields. These observations were made towards MSX sources that passed cuts
in earlier versions of the survey, but were later excluded.",2006-05-31T14:20:59Z
"The Hubble Deep Field North SCUBA Super-map IV - Characterizing
  submillimetre galaxies using deep Spitzer imaging","We present SEDs, Spitzer colours, and IR luminosities for 850 micron selected
galaxies in the GOODS-N field. Using the deep Spitzer Legacy images and new
data and reductions of the VLA-HDF radio data, we find statistically secure
counterparts for 60 per cent (21/35) of our submm sample, and identify
tentative counterparts for another 12 objects. This is the largest sample of
submm galaxies with statistically secure counterparts detected in the radio and
with Spitzer. We find that in most cases the 850 micron emission is dominated
by a single 24 micron source. A composite rest-frame SED shows that the submm
sources peak at longer wavelengths than those of local ULIRGs of the same
luminosity and therefore appear to be cooler. The SEDs of submm galaxies are
also different from those of their high redshift neighbours, the near-IR
selected BzK galaxies, whose mid-IR to radio SEDs are more like those of local
ULIRGs. Using 24 micron. 850 micron and 1.4 GHz observations, we fit templates
that span the mid-IR through radio to derived the integrated IR luminosity of
the submm galaxies. By themselves, 24 micron and radio fluxes are able to
predict LIR reasonably well because they are relatively insensitive to
temperature. However, the submm flux by itself consistently overpredicts LIR
when using spectral templates which obey the local ULIRG temperature-luminosity
relation. The shorter Spitzer wavelengths sample the stellar bump at the
redshifts of the submm sources, and we find that the Spitzer photometry alone
provides a model independent estimate of the redshift. Using X-ray and mid-IR
data, only 5 per cent of our secure counterparts show strong evidence for an
active galactic nucleus dominating the IR luminosity.",2006-05-22T20:04:42Z
"Dissecting Galaxy Colors with GALEX, SDSS, and Spitzer","We combine data from SDSS and the GALEX and Spitzer observatories to create a
sample of galaxies observed homogeneously from the UV to the Far-IR. This
sample, consisting of ~460 galaxies observed spectroscopically by SDSS provides
a multiwavelength (0.15-24 micron) view of obscured and unobscured star
formation in nearby (z<0.3) galaxies with SFRs ranging from 0.01 to 100
M_solar/yr. We calculate a robust dust measure from the infrared to UV ratio
(IRX) and explore the influence of star formation history (SFH) on the dust-UV
color relation (i.e. the IRX-beta relation). We find that the UV colors of
galaxies are only weakly dependent on their SFH as measured by the 4000A break.
However, we find that the contributions of dust and SFH are distinguishable
when colors at widely separated wavelengths (e.g. 0.23-3.6 micron) are
introduced. We show this explicitly by recasting the IRX-beta relation as a
more general IRX-SFH-color relation, which we examine in different projections.
We also determine simple fits to this relation.",2006-05-18T21:21:20Z
Is Radiation of Quantized Black Holes Observable?,"If primordial black holes (PBH) saturate the present upper limit on the dark
matter density in our Solar system and if their radiation spectrum is discrete,
the sensitivity of modern detectors is close to that necessary for detecting
this radiation. This conclusion is not in conflict with the upper limits on the
PBH evaporation rate.",2006-04-01T05:25:06Z
NICMOS Status,"We provide an overview of the most important calibration aspects of the
NICMOS instrument on board of HST. We describe the performance of the
instrument after the installation of the NICMOS Cooling System, and show that
the behavior of the instrument has become very stable and predictable. We
detail the improvements made to the NICMOS pipeline and outline plans for
future developments. The derivation of the absolute photometric zero-point
calibration is described in detail. Finally, we describe and quantify a newly
discovered count-rate dependent non-linearity in the NICMOS cameras. This new
non-linearity is distinctly different from the total count dependent
non-linearity that is well known for near-infrared detectors. We show that the
non-linearity has a power law behavior, with pixels with high system, or vice
versa, pixels with low count rate detecting slightly less than expected. The
effect has a wavelength dependence with observations at the shortest
wavelengths being the most affected (~0.05-0.1 mag per dex flux change at ~1
micron, 0.03 mag per dex at 1.6 micron).",2006-04-19T02:56:56Z
The Discovery of Cepheids and a Distance to NGC 5128,"We discuss a new distance to NGC 5128 (Centaurus A) based on Cepheid
variables observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Twelve F555W (V) and six
F814W (I) epochs of cosmic-ray-split Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 observations
were obtained. A total of 56 bona-fide Cepheids were discovered, with periods
ranging from 5 to ~50 days; five of these are likely Population II Cepheids of
the W Virginis class, associated with the bulge or halo of NGC 5128. Based on
the period and V and I-band luminosities of a sub-sample of 42 classical (Pop
I) Cepheids, and adopting a Large Magellanic Cloud distance modulus and
extinction of 18.50 +/- 0.10 mag and E(B-V)=0.10 mag, respectively, the true
reddening-corrected distance modulus to NGC 5128 is mu_0 = 27.67 +/- 0.12
(random)+/- 0.16 (systematic) mag, corresponding to a distance of 3.42 +/- 0.18
(random) +/- 0.25 (systematic) Mpc. The random uncertainty in the distance is
dominated by the error on the assumed value for the ratio of total to selective
absorption, R_V, in NGC 5128, and by the possible metallicity dependence of the
Cepheid Period-Luminosity relation at V and I. This represent the first
determination of a Cepheid distance to an early-type galaxy.",2006-05-29T20:17:33Z
"3.9 day orbital modulation in the TeV gamma-ray flux and spectrum from
  the X-ray binary LS 5039","New observations of LS 5039, a High Mass X-ray Binary comprising a massive
star and compact object, were carried out with the High Energy Stereoscopic
System of Cherenkov Telescopes (H.E.S.S.) in 2005 at very high energy (VHE)
gamma-ray energies. These observations reveal that its flux and energy spectrum
are modulated with the 3.9 day orbital period of the binary system. This is the
first time in gamma-ray astronomy that orbital modulation has been observed,
and periodicity clearly established using ground-based gamma-ray detectors. The
VHE gamma-ray emission is largely confined to half of the orbit, peaking around
the inferior conjunction epoch of the compact object. For this epoch, there is
also a hardening of the energy spectrum in the energy range between 0.2 TeV and
a few TeV. The flux vs. orbital phase profile provides the first clear
indication of gamma-ray absorption via pair production within an astrophysical
source, a process which is expected to occur if the gamma-ray production site
is situated within ~1 AU of the compact object. Moreover the production region
size must be not significantly greater than the binary separation (~0.15 AU).
Notably, these constraints are also considerably smaller than the collimated
outflows or jets (extending out to ~1000 AU) observed in LS 5039. The spectral
hardening could arise from variations with phase in the maximum electron
energies, and/or the dominant VHE gamma-ray production mechanism.",2006-07-10T14:50:08Z
"DEMON: a Proposal for a Satellite-Borne Experiment to study Dark Matter
  and Dark Energy","We outline a novel satellite mission concept, DEMON, aimed at advancing our
comprehension of both dark matter and dark energy, taking full advantage of two
complementary methods: weak lensing and the statistics of galaxy clusters. We
intend to carry out a 5000 sqdeg combined IR, optical and X-ray survey with
galaxies up to a redshift of z~2 in order to determine the shear correlation
function. We will also find ~100000 galaxy clusters, making it the largest
survey of this type to date. The DEMON spacecraft will comprise one IR/optical
and eight X-ray telescopes, coupled to multiple cameras operating at different
frequency bands. To a great extent, the technology employed has already been
partially tested on ongoing missions, therefore ensuring improved reliability.",2006-05-31T21:13:37Z
"Proposing a Experimental Astronomical Test to the Existence of the
  Quantum Strings","It is proposed a model of Kaluza Klein that does make the quantification of
the electric charges without magnetic monopoles. This model of Kaluza Klein
allows to calculate de radius of compactation proposed for Klein. The model is
of Kaluza Klein, but it has consequences in the theory of the quantum strings,
and it is possible to indicate a manner of to test the existence of the quantum
strings.The model indicates that: if the quantum strings exist really, the
cosmological variation of the fine structure constant would do quantum jumps.
If this variation is continuous, the quantum strings does not exist.It is
possible to the astronomers to decide this.",2006-04-19T22:54:50Z
The First VERITAS Telescope,"The first atmospheric Cherenkov telescope of VERITAS (the Very Energetic
Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System) has been in operation since February
2005. We present here a technical description of the instrument and a summary
of its performance. The calibration methods are described, along with the
results of Monte Carlo simulations of the telescope and comparisons between
real and simulated data. The analysis of TeV $\gamma$-ray observations of the
Crab Nebula, including the reconstructed energy spectrum, is shown to give
results consistent with earlier measurements. The telescope is operating as
expected and has met or exceeded all design specifications.",2006-04-06T04:25:48Z
SiO Maser Survey of the Inner Bar of the Galactic Bulge,"We surveyed 291 MSX/2MASS infrared objects in the 7 x 2 deg area of the
galactic center in the 43 GHz SiO J=1--0 v=1 and 2 maser lines, obtaining
accurate radial velocities of 163 detected objects. The surveyed area is the
region where the IRAS catalog is incomplete due to contamination by high source
density. The objects in the present MSX/2MASS sample were chosen to have
similar infrared characteristics to those of the previous SiO-maser-survey
samples based on the color selected IRAS sources. The sampling based on the
2MASS catalog causes a bias to the foreside objects of the bulge due to heavy
obscuration by interstellar dust; the detections are considerably leaned on the
V_{lsr}<0 side. The l--v diagram reveals two conspicuous features, which were
not present or tenuous in the previous studies: one feature indicating a linear
velocity increase with longitude with |l|<1.5 deg, which is likely associated
with the inner bar, and the other feature having considerably eccentric
velocities more than those of the normal x_1-orbit family feature. The
extinction-corrected K magnitudes (if used as a distance modulus) tend to show
a sequential deposition of these objects along the line of sight toward the
Galactic center depending on their radial velocities. The tendency that
appeared in the distance measures is consistent with the bulge-bar dynamical
model utilizing the periodic orbit families in the bar potential.",2006-05-09T06:18:04Z
"Warm Molecular Gas in the Outflow and Envelope of IRAS 12496-7650 (DK
  Cha)","Aims:To obtain insight into the physical structure of the warm gas in the
inner envelope of protostars and the interaction with the outflow. Methods:
Sub-millimeter observations of 12CO, 13CO and/or C18O in J=3-2, J=4-3 and J=7-6
were obtained with the APEX Telescope towards IRAS 12496-7650, an intermediate
mass young stellar object. The data are compared to ISO-LWS observations of CO
J=14-13 up to J=19-18 lines to test the different proposed origins of the CO
lines. Results: The outflow is prominently detected in the 3-2 and 4-3 lines,
but not seen at similar velocities in the 7-6 line, constraining the
temperature in the high-velocity (> 5 km/s from line center) gas to less than
50 K, much lower than inferred from the analysis of the ISO-LWS data. In
addition, no isothermal gas model can reproduce the emission in both the 7-6
and the higher-J ISO-LWS lines.The 7-6 line probably originates in the inner
(<250 AU) region of the envelope at ~150 K. Detailed radiative transfer
calculations suggest that the ISO-LWS lines are excited by a different
mechanism, possibly related to the larger-scale outflow. All possible
mechanisms on scales smaller than 8 "" are excluded. High-resolution continuum
as well as high-J 12CO and isotopic line mapping are needed to better constrain
the structure of the warm gas in the inner envelope and the interaction with
the outflow.",2006-05-19T19:18:00Z
3D MHD Simulations of Laboratory Plasma Jets,"Jets and outflows are thought to be an integral part of accretion phenomena
and are associated with a large variety of objects. In these systems, the
interaction of magnetic fields with an accretion disk and/or a magnetized
central object is thought to be responsible for the acceleration and
collimation of plasma into jets and wider angle flows. In this paper we present
three-dimensional MHD simulations of magnetically driven, radiatively cooled
laboratory jets that are produced on the MAGPIE experimental facility. The
general outflow structure comprises an expanding magnetic cavity which is
collimated by the pressure of an extended plasma background medium, and a
magnetically confined jet which develops within the magnetic cavity. Although
this structure is intrinsically transient and instabilities in the jet and
disruption of the magnetic cavity ultimately lead to its break-up, a well
collimated, knotty jet still emerges from the system; such clumpy morphology is
reminiscent of that observed in many astrophysical jets. The possible
introduction in the experiments of angular momentum and axial magnetic field
will also be discussed.",2006-06-30T13:37:39Z
Alignment tests for low CMB multipoles,"We investigate the large scale anomalies in the angular distribution of the
cosmic microwave background radiation as measured by WMAP using several tests.
These tests, based on the multipole vector expansion, measure correlations
between the phases of the multipoles as expressed by the directions of the
multipole vectors and their associated normal planes. We have computed the
probability distribution functions for 46 such tests, for the multipoles l=2-5.
We confirm earlier findings that point to a high level of alignment between l=2
(quadrupole) and l=3 (octopole), but with our tests we do not find significant
planarity in the octopole. In addition, we have found other possible anomalies
in the alignment between the octopole and the l=4 (hexadecupole) components, as
well as in the planarity of l=4 and l=5. We introduce the notion of a total
likelihood to estimate the relevance of the low-multipoles tests of
non-gaussianity. We show that, as a result of these tests, the CMB maps which
are most widely used for cosmological analysis lie within the ~ 10% of randomly
generated maps with lowest likelihoods.",2006-04-17T03:01:23Z
Star-forming QSO host galaxies,"The recent finding of substantial masses of cold molecular gas as well as
young stellar populations in the host galaxies of quasars is at odds with
results of Hubble Space Telescope imaging studies, since the latter appear to
yield mature, quiescent early type hosts. It is demonstrated here that the
characterization as `quiescent' is incorrect. Radio and far-infrared properties
of both the HST sample and a larger comparison sample of uv-excess selected
radio-quiet QSOs are consistent with substantial recent star-formation
activity.",2006-07-31T06:29:52Z
Report on the CoRoT Evolution and Seismic Tools Activity,"We present the work undertaken by the Evolution and Seismic Tools Activity
(ESTA) team of the CoRoT Seismology Working Group. We have focused on two main
tasks: Task 1 - now finished - has aimed at testing, comparing and optimising
seven stellar evolution codes which will be used to model the internal
structure and evolution of the CoRoT target stars. Task 2, still underway, aims
at testing, comparing and optimising different seismic codes used to calculate
the oscillations of models for different types of stars. The results already
obtained are quite satisfactory, showing minor differences between the
different numerical tools provided the same assumptions on the physical
parameters are made. This work gives us confidence on the numerical tools that
will be available to interpret the future CoRoT seismic data.",2006-05-27T19:56:38Z
"Rates and properties of type Ia supernovae as a function of mass and
  star-formation in their host galaxies","(ABRIDGED) We show that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are formed within both
very young and old stellar populations, with observed rates that depend on the
stellar mass and mean star-formation rates (SFRs) of their host galaxies.
Models where the SN Ia rate depends solely on host galaxy stellar mass are
ruled out with 99% confidence. Our analysis is based on 100
spectroscopically-confirmed SNe Ia, plus 24 photometrically-classified events,
all from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) and distributed over 0.2<z<0.75.
Using multi-band photometry, we estimate stellar masses and SFRs for the SN Ia
host galaxies by fitting their broad-band spectral energy distributions with
the galaxy spectral synthesis code, PEGASE.2. We show that the SN Ia rate per
unit mass is proportional to the specific SFR of the parent galaxies -- more
vigorously star-forming galaxies host more SNe Ia per unit stellar mass,
broadly equivalent to the trend of increasing SN Ia rate in later-type galaxies
seen in the local universe. Following earlier suggestions for a simple
""two-component"" model approximating the SN Ia rate, we find bivariate linear
dependencies of the SN Ia rate on both the stellar masses and the mean SFRs of
the host systems. We also demonstrate a dependence of distant SN Ia light-curve
shapes on star-formation in the host galaxy, similar to trends observed
locally. Passive galaxies, with no star-formation, preferentially host
faster-declining/dimmer SNe Ia, while slower-declining/brighter events are only
found in systems with ongoing star-formation. We model the light-curve width
distribution in star-forming galaxies as the sum of a young component, and an
old component taken from the distribution in non-star-forming galaxies.",2006-05-18T14:24:31Z
Black-Hole Accretion Disc as an Analogue Gravity Model,"We formulate and solve the equations governing the transonic behaviour of a
general relativistic black-hole accretion disc with non-zero advection
velocity. We demonstrate that a relativistic Rankine-Hugoniot shock may form
leading to the formation of accretion powered outflow. We show that the
critical points of transonic discs generally do not coincide with the
corresponding sonic points. The collection of such sonic points forms an
axisymmetric hypersurface, generators of which are the acoustic null geodesics,
i.e. the phonon trajectories. Such a surface is shown to be identical with an
acoustic event horizon. The acoustic surface gravity and the corresponding
analogue horizon temperature $T_{AH}$ at the acoustic horizon are then computed
in terms of fundamental accretion parameters. Physically, the analogue
temperature is associated with the thermal phonon radiation analogous to the
Hawking radiation of the black-hole horizon.Thus, an axisymmetric black-hole
accretion disc is established as a natural example of the classical analogue
gravity model, for which two kinds of horizon exist simultaneously. We have
shown that for some values of astrophysically relevant accretion parameters,
the analogue temperature exceeds the corresponding Hawking temperature. We
point out that acoustic {\it white holes} can also be generated for a
multi-transonic black-hole accretion with a shock. Such a white hole, produced
at the shock, is always flanked by two acoustic black holes generated at the
inner and the outer sonic points. Finally, we discuss possible applications of
our work to other astrophysical events which may exhibit analogue effects.",2006-04-21T20:12:21Z
"Density-Functional-Theory Calculations of Matter in Strong Magnetic
  Fields: II. Infinite Chains and Condensed Matter","We present new, ab initio calculations of the electronic structure of
one-dimensional infinite chains and three-dimensional condensed matter in
strong magnetic fields ranging from B=10^12 G to 2x10^15 G, appropriate for
observed magnetic neutron stars. At these field strengths, the magnetic forces
on the electrons dominate over the Coulomb forces, and to a good approximation
the electrons are confined to the ground Landau level. Our calculations are
based on the density functional theory, and use a local magnetic
exchange-correlation function appropriate in the strong field regime. The band
structures of electrons in different Landau orbitals are computed
self-consistently. Numerical results of the ground-state energies and electron
work functions are given for one-dimensional chains of H, He, C, and Fe.
Fitting formulae for the B-dependence of the energies are also provided. For
all the field strengths considered in this paper, hydrogen, helium, and carbon
chains are found to be bound relative to individual atoms (although for B less
than a few x 10^12 G, the relative binding between C and C_infinity is small).
Iron chains are significantly bound for B>10^14 G and are weakly bound if at
all at B<10^13 G. We also study the cohesive property of three-dimensional
condensed matter of H, He, C, and Fe at zero pressure, constructed from
interacting chains in a body-centered tetragonal lattice. Such
three-dimensional condensed matter is found to be bound relative to individual
atoms, with the cohesive energy increasing rapidly with increasing B.",2006-07-12T21:11:57Z

"Concerning the instantaneous mass and the extent of an expanding
  universe","In this article we want to answer the cosmologically relevant question what,
with some good semantic and physical reason, could be called the mass of an
infinitely extended, homogeneously matter-filled and expanding universe. To
answer this question we produce a space-like sum of instantaneous cosmic energy
depositions surrounding equally each spacepoint in the homogeneous universe. We
calculate the added-up instantaneous cosmic energy per volume around an
arbitrary space point in the expanding universe. To carry out this sum we use
as basic metrics an analogy to the inner Schwarzschild metric applied to stars,
but this time applied to the spacepoint-related universe. It is then shown that
this leads to the added-up proper energy within a sphere of a finite outer
critical radius defining the point-related infinity. As a surprise this radius
turns out to be reciprocal to the square root of the prevailing average cosmic
energy density. The equivalent mass of the universe can then also be calculated
and, by the expression which is obtained here, shows a scaling with this
critical radius of this universe, a virtue of the universe which was already
often called for in earlier works by E.Mach, H.Thirring and F.Hoyle and others.
This radius on the other hand can be shown to be nearly equal to the
Schwarzschild radius of the so-defined mass of the universe.",2006-06-19T14:02:25Z
Inflation is the generic feature of phantom field-not the big-rip,"A class of solutions for phantom field corresponding to a generalized
k-essence lagrangian has been presented, employing a simple method which
provides the scope to explore many such. All the solutions having dynamical
state parameter are found to touch the magic line w = -1, asymptotically. The
solutions with constant equation of state can represent phantom, quitessence or
an ordinary scalar field cosmologies depending on the choice of a couple of
parameters of the theory. For w approximately equal to -1, quintessence and
phantom models are indistinguishable through the Hubble parameter. Finally,
inflation rather than big-rip has been found to be the generic feature of
phantom cosmology.",2006-05-16T13:48:45Z
"NGC 7419: A young open cluster with a number of very young intermediate
  mass pre-MS stars","We present a photometric and spectroscopic study of the young open cluster
NGC 7419, which is know to host a large number of classical Be stars for
reasons not well understood. Based on CCD photometric observations of 327 stars
in UBV passbands, we estimated the cluster parameters as, reddening E(B-V) =
1.65 +/- 0.15 mag and distance = 2900 +/- 400 pc. The turn off age of the
cluster was estimated as 25 +/- 5 Myr using isochrone fits. UBV data of the
stars were combined with JHK data from 2MASS and were used to create the near
infrared (NIR) (J-H) vs (H-K) colour-colour diagram. A large fraction of stars
(42%) was found to have NIR excess and their location in the diagram was used
to identify them as intermediate mass pre-MS stars. The isochrone fits to
pre-MS stars in the optical colour-magnitude diagram showed that the turn-on
age of the cluster is 0.3 - 3 Myr. This indicates that there has been a recent
episode of star formation in the vicinity of the cluster. Slit-less spectra
were used to identify 27 stars which showed H-alpha in emission in the field of
the cluster, of which 6 are new identifications. All these stars were found to
show NIR excess and located closer to the region populated by Herbig Ae/Be
stars in the (J-H) vs (H-K) diagram. Slit spectra of 25 stars were obtained in
the region 3700A - 9000A. The spectral features were found to be very similar
to those of Herbig Be stars. Those stars were found to be more reddened than
the main sequence stars by 0.4 mag on an average. Thus the emission line stars
found in this cluster are more similar to the Herbig Be type stars where the
circumstellar material is the remnant of the accretion disk.",2006-04-30T12:31:29Z
Can We Trust the Dust? Evidence of Dust Segregation in Molecular Clouds,"Maps of estimated dust column density in molecular clouds are usually assumed
to reliably trace the total gas column density structure. In this work we
present results showing a clear discrepancy between the dust and the gas
distribution in the Taurus molecular cloud complex. We compute the power
spectrum of a 2MASS extinction map of the Taurus region and find it is much
shallower than the power spectrum of a 13CO map of the same region previously
analyzed. This discrepancy may be explained as the effect of grain growth on
the grain extinction efficiency. However, this would require a wide range of
maximum grain sizes, which is ruled out based on constraints from the
extinction curve and the available grain models. We show that major effects due
to CO formation and depletion are also ruled out. Our result may therefore
suggest the existence of intrinsic spatial fluctuations of the dust to gas
ratio, with amplitude increasing toward smaller scales. Preliminary results of
numerical simulations of trajectories of inertial particles in turbulent flows
illustrate how the process of clustering of dust grains by the cloud turbulence
may lead to observable effects. However, these results cannot be directly
applied to large scale supersonic and magnetized turbulence at present.",2006-07-03T16:15:46Z
Detached shells as tracers of AGB-ISM bow shocks,"New Spitzer imaging observations have revealed the structure around the Mira
variable star R Hya to be a one-sided parabolic arc 100 arcsec to the West
stretching from North to South. We successfully model R Hya and its
surroundings in terms of an interaction of the stellar wind from an asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) star with the interstellar medium (ISM) the star moves
through. Our three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation reproduces the structure
as a bow shock into the oncoming ISM. We propose this as another explanation of
detached shells around such stars which should be considered alongside current
theories of internal origin. The simulation predicts the existence of a tail of
ram-pressure-stripped AGB material stretching downstream. Indications for such
a tail behind R Hya are seen in IRAS maps.",2006-07-21T11:42:06Z
Hidden invariance in Gurzadyan-Xue cosmological models,"The dark energy formula derived by Gurzadyan and Xue which leads to a value
fitting the SN data, provides a scaling relation between the physical constants
and cosmological parameters and defines a set of cosmological models. In
previous works we have considered several of those models and derived the
cosmological equations for each case. In this letter, we present the phase
portrait analysis of those models. Surprisingly we found, first, that the
separatrix in the phase space which determines the character of solutions
depends solely on the value of the current matter density. Namely, at
$\Omega_m>2/3$ the equations describe Friedmannian Universe with the classical
singularity at the beginning. While at $\Omega_m<2/3$ all solutions for all
models start with zero density and non vanishing scale factor. Secondly, more
remarkable, the value $\Omega_{sep}=2/3$ defining the separatrix is the same
for all models, which reveales an underlying invariance hidden in the models,
possibly, due to the basic nature of the GX-scaling.",2006-03-12T15:50:14Z
CS 30322-023: an ultra metal-poor TP-AGB star?,"With [Fe/H] = -3.5, CS 30322-023 is the most metal-poor star to exhibit a
clear s-process signature and the most metal-poor ``lead star'' known. CS
30322-023 is also remarkable in having the lowest surface gravity (log g <=
-0.3) among the metal-poor stars studied to date. The available evidence
indicates that this star is presently a thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant
branch (TP-AGB) star, with no strong indication of binarity thus far (although
a signal of period 192 d is clearly present in the radial-velocity data, this
is likely due to pulsation of the stellar envelope). We show that low-mass
TP-AGB stars are not expected to be exceedingly rare in a magnitude-limited
sample such as the HK survey, because their high luminosities make it possible
to sample them over a very large volume. The strong N overabundance and the low
12C/13C ratio (4) in this star is typical of the operation of the CN cycle.
Coupled with a Na overabundance and the absence of a strong C overabundance,
this pattern seems to imply that hot-bottom burning operated in this star,
which should then have a mass of at least 2 Msun. However, the luminosity
associated with this mass would put the star at a distance of about 50 kpc, in
the outskirts of the galactic halo. We explore alternative scenarios in which
the observed abundance pattern results from some mixing mechanism yet to be
identified occurring in a single low-metallicity 0.8 Msun AGB star, or from
pollution by matter from an intermediate-mass AGB companion which has undergone
hot-bottom burning. We stress, however, that our abundances may be subject to
uncertainties due to NLTE or 3D granulation effects which were not taken into
consideration.",2006-05-26T09:23:28Z
"The CFHTLS Real Time Analysis System ""Optically Selected GRB Afterglows""","We describe a wide and deep search for optical GRB afterglows on images taken
with MegaCAM at the Canada France Hawaii Telescope, within the framework of the
CFHT Legacy Survey. This search is performed in near real-time thanks to a Real
Time Analysis System called ""Optically Selected GRB Afterglows"", which has been
completely realized and installed on a dedicated computer in Hawaii. This
pipeline automatically and quickly analyzes Megacam images and extracts from
them a list of astrometrically and photometrically variable objects which are
displayed on a web page for validation by a member of the collaboration. In
this paper, we comprehensively describe the RTAS process. We also present
statistical results based on nearly one full year of operation, showing the
quality of the images and the performance of the RTAS. Finally, we compare the
efficiency of this study with similar searches, propose an ideal observational
strategy using simulations, and discuss general considerations on the searches
for GRB afterglows independently of the prompt emission. This is the first of a
series of two papers. A second paper will discuss the characterization of
variable objects we have found, as well as the GRB afterglow candidates and
their nature. We will also estimate or at least constrain the collimation
factor of GRB using the totality of the Very Wide Survey observations.",2006-05-31T18:03:25Z
Toward Resolving the Outflow Engine: An Observational Perspective,"Jets from young stars represent one of the most striking signposts of star
formation. The phenomenon has been researched for over two decades and there is
now general agreement that such jets are generated as a by-product of
accretion; most likely by the accretion disk itself. Thus they mimic what
occurs in more exotic objects such as active galactic nuclei and micro-quasars.
The precise mechanism for their production however remains a mystery. To a
large degree, progress is hampered observationally by the embedded nature of
many jet sources as well as a lack of spatial resolution: Crude estimates, as
well as more sophisticated models, nevertheless suggest that jets are
accelerated and focused on scales of a few AU at most.
  It is only in the past few years however that we have begun to probe such
scales in detail using classical T Tauri stars as touchstones. Application of
adaptive optics, data provided by the HST, use of specialised techniques such
as spectro-astrometry, and the development of spectral diagnostic tools, are
beginning to reveal conditions in the jet launch zone. This has helped
enormously to constrain models. Further improvements in the quality of the
observational data are expected when the new generation of interferometers come
on-line. Here we review some of the most dramatic findings in this area since
Protostars and Planets~IV including indications for jet rotation, i.e. that
they transport angular momentum. We will also show how measurements, such as
those of width and the velocity field close to the source, suggest jets are
initially launched as warm magneto-centrifugal disk winds. (abridged)",2006-05-23T19:01:59Z
The Mass of the Central Black Hole in the Seyfert Galaxy NGC 4151,"In order to improve the reverberation-mapping based estimate of the mass of
the central supermassive black hole in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151, we have
reanalyzed archival ultraviolet monitoring spectra from two campaigns
undertaken with the International Ultraviolet Explorer. We measure
emission-line time delays for four lines, C IV 1549, He II 1640, C III] 1909,
and Mg II 2798, from both campaigns. We combine these measurements with the
dispersion of the variable part of each respective emission line to obtain the
mass of the central object. Despite the problematic nature of some of the data,
we are able to measure a mass of 41.1 (+/- 7.3) million solar masses, although
this, like all reverberation-based masses, is probably systematically uncertain
by a factor of 3-4.",2006-05-01T20:02:46Z
Calibrating an Interferometric Null,"One of the biggest challenges associated with a nulling interferometer-based
approach to detecting extra-solar Earth-like planets comes from the extremely
stringent requirements of pathlength, polarization and amplitude matching in
the interferometer. To the extent that the light from multiple apertures are
not matched in these properties, light will leak through the nuller and confuse
the search for a planetary signal. Here we explore the possibility of using the
coherence properties of the starlight to separate contributions from the planet
and nuller leakage. We find that straightforward modifications to the optical
layout of a nulling interferometer will allow one to measure and correct for
the leakage to a high degree of precision. This nulling calibration relaxes the
field matching requirements substantially, and should consequently simplify the
instrument design.",2006-06-08T01:37:21Z
The Magellanic Stream in Modified Newtonian Dynamics,"The dynamics of the Magellanic Stream (MS) as a series of clouds extending
from the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) to the south Galactic pole is affected by the
distribution and the amount of matter in the Milky Way. We calculate the
gravitational effect of the Galactic disk on the MS in the framework of
modified Newtonian dynamics(MOND) and compare with observations of the Stream's
radial velocity. We consider the tidal force of the Galaxy, which strips
material from the MCs to form the MS, and, using a no-halo model of the Galaxy,
we ignore the effect of the drag of the Galactic halo on the MS. We also
compare the MONDian dynamics with that in logarithmic and power-law dark halo
models and show that the MOND theory seems plausible for describing the
dynamics of satellite galaxies such as the MCs. Finally, we perform a maximum
likelihood analysis to obtain the best MOND parameters for the Galactic disk.",2006-06-10T15:00:05Z
"The remarkable light and colour variability of Small Magellanic Cloud Be
  stars","(Abridged) Some 240 blue stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud are investigated
on their fantastic irregular continuum variability. We report here two results
regarding these stars. First, their optical flux excess is correlated to their
near-IR flux excess, as determined from optical EROSII light curves and 2MASS
measurements. Second, the relation between optical colour and magnitude is
observed to be bi-valued in 40% of the cases, resulting in a ""loop"" when the
light curve is presented in a colour-magnitude diagram. We argue that optical
variability for a large fraction of the variable stars is due to variations in
the amount of bound-free and free-free radiation. We do simple model
calculations that allow us to interpret the observed colour-magnitude
variability as due to an outflowing ionized circumstellar disk. The mass loss
of the central star is variable, i.e. on or off. Once the star stops losing
mass, the disk evolves naturally into a ring. The observed bi-valued
colour-magnitude relation is the transition of a partially optically thick to a
fully optically thin disk. Significantly, the loop is traversed clockwise by
outflowing matter, but anti-clockwise by infalling matter. It is observed that
the material is generally outflowing, but few cases of inflow are also
observed.",2006-06-12T17:54:07Z
"Do most planetary nebulae derive from binaries? I Population synthesis
  model of the galactic planetary nebula population produced by singlestars and
  binaries","We present a population synthesis calculation to derive the total number of
planetary nebulae (PN) in the Galaxy that descend from single stars and stars
in binary systems. Using the most recent literature results on galactic and
stellar formation as well as stellar evolution, we predict the total number of
galactic PNe with radii <0.9 pc to be (46,000 +/- 13,000). We do not claim this
to be the complete population, since there can be visible PNe with radii larger
than this limit. However, by taking this limit, we make our predicted
population inherently comparable to the observationally-based value of
Peimbert, who determined (7200 +/- 1800) PNe should reside in the Galaxy today.
Our prediction is discrepant with the observations at the 2.9-sigma level, a
disagreement which we argue is meaningful in view of our specific treatment of
the uncertainty. We conclude that it is likely that only a subset of the stars
thought to be capable of making a visible PN, actually do. In the second paper
in this series, an argument will be presented that the bulk of the galactic PN
population might be better explained if only binaries produce PNe.
  The predicted PN formation rate density from single stars and binaries is
(1.1 +/- 0.5) x 10^{-12} PN/yr per cubic pc in the local neighborhood. This
number is lower than the most recent PN birthrate density estimates of 2.1 x
10^{-12} PN/yr per cubic pc, which are based on local PN counts and the PN
distance scale, but more in line with the white dwarf birthrate densities
determined by Liebert et al. ((1.0 +/- 0.25) x 10^{-12} WD/yr per cubic pc).
The predicted PN birthrate density will be revised down, if we assume that only
binaries make PNe. This revision will imply that the PN distance scale has to
be revised to larger values.",2006-06-14T18:37:09Z
A statistical analysis of a Galactic all sky survey at 1.4 GHz,"Radio surveys at frequencies of about 1 GHz allow to map the synchrotron
emission in a frequency range where (except for very low Galactic latitudes or
towards localized regions) it dominates over the other radio components. New
all sky total intensity and polarization data at 1.4 GHz have been recently
collected. We focus on the Galactic radio emission correlation properties
described in terms of angular power spectrum (APS). We present for the first
time the APS, in both total intensity and polarization modes, for some
representative Galactic cuts and suitable APS power law parametrizations.",2006-07-04T07:06:09Z
"The Parkes multibeam pulsar survey: VI. Discovery and timing of 142
  pulsars and a Galactic population analysis","[ABRIDGED] We present the discovery and follow-up observations of 142 pulsars
found in the Parkes 20-cm multibeam pulsar survey of the Galactic plane. These
new discoveries bring the total number of pulsars found by the survey to 742.
In addition to tabulating spin and astrometric parameters, along with pulse
width and flux density information, we present orbital characteristics for 13
binary pulsars which form part of the new sample. Combining these results from
another recent Parkes multibeam survey at high Galactic latitudes, we have a
sample of 1008 normal pulsars which we use to carry out a determination of
their Galactic distribution and birth rate. We infer a total Galactic
population of 30000 +/- 1100 potentially detectable pulsars (i.e. those beaming
towards us) having 1.4-GHz luminosities above 0.1 mJy kpc squared. Using a
pulsar current analysis, we derive the birth rate of this population to be 1.4
+/- 0.2 pulsars per century. An important conclusion from our work is that the
inferred radial density function of pulsars depends strongly on the assumed
distribution of free electrons in the Galaxy. As a result, any analyses using
the most recent electron model of Cordes & Lazio predict a dearth of pulsars in
the inner Galaxy. We show that this model can also bias the inferred pulsar
scale height with respect to the Galactic plane. Combining our results with
other Parkes multibeam surveys we find that the population is best described by
an exponential distribution with a scale height of 330 pc.",2006-07-28T12:08:12Z
The radii of thousands of star clusters in M51 with HST/ACS,"We exploit the superb resolution of the new HST/ACS mosaic image of M51 to
select a large sample of young (< 1 Gyr) star clusters in the spiral disk,
based on their sizes. The image covers the entire spiral disk in B, V, I and
H_alpha, at a resolution of 2 pc per pixel. The surface density distribution of
4357 resolved clusters shows that the clusters are more correlated with clouds
than with stars, and we find a hint of enhanced cluster formation at the
corotation radius. The radius distribution of a sample of 769 clusters with
more accurate radii suggests that young star clusters have a preferred
effective radius of ~3 pc, which is similar to the preferred radius of the much
older GCs. However, in contrast to the GCs, the young clusters in M51 do not
show a relation between radius and galactocentric distance. This means that the
clusters did not form in tidal equilibrium with their host galaxy, nor that
their radius is related to the ambient pressure.",2006-05-01T09:48:35Z
"Properties of Hickson Compact Groups and of the Loose Groups within
  which they are Embedded","We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) redshift catalogue to look for
galaxies with accordant redshifts in the nearby environment (up to ~2 Mpc) of
15 Hickson Compact Groups (HCG) and 7 more HCG+environment from the literature.
We find that: (a) HCG's tend to be aligned with the overall galaxy distribution
in their ~1 Mpc environment, (b) the well-established orientation effect by
which the group velocity dispersion correlates with group axial ratio, is
present also in the HCG+environment systems, (c) the radial velocity dispersion
of the HCG+environment systems and of ordinary poor groups only weakly depends
on the group richness, (d) the mean absolute K-band magnitude of E/S0 galaxies
in HCGs is similar to that in ordinary poor groups, and is brighter than that
of isolated E/S0's, indicating that they were formed by the merging of two
galaxies of similar luminosity, (e) the fraction of E/S0 galaxies in these HCGs
depends only weakly on the group richness and velocity dispersion, (f) the
fraction of AGNs is similar in the HCGs and their close environment, while that
of starbursts is significantly higher in the HCGs, (g) the fraction of AGNs and
starbursts is anti-correlated with the velocity dispersion of the
HCG+environment systems. Furthermore, the observed fractions of early-type and
active galaxies as well as their correlations with the group velocity
dispersion suggests a picture by which nuclear activity and galaxy
transformation by merging is instigated by effective gravitational interactions
in the low-velocity dispersion groups, which then dynamically evolve via
virialization processes to higher velocity dispersion groups, which thus have a
higher fraction of early-type galaxies.",2006-05-04T23:50:52Z
"Estimations of orbital parameters of exoplanets from transit photometry
  by using dynamical constraints","The probability of the detection of Earth-like exoplanets may increase in the
near future after the launch of the space missions using the transit photometry
as observation method. By using this technique only the semi-major axis of the
detected planet can be determined, and there will be no information on the
upper limit of its orbital eccentricity. However, the orbital eccentricity is a
very important parameter, not only from a dynamical point of view, since it
gives also information on the climate and the habitability of the Earth-like
planets. In this paper a possible procedure is suggested for confining the
eccentricity of an exoplanet discovered by transit photometry if an already
known giant planet orbits also in the system.",2006-06-01T13:49:15Z
"Variability of the NGC 1333 IRAS 4A Outflow: Molecular Hydrogen and
  Silicon Monoxide Images","The NGC 1333 region was observed in the H2 1-0 S(1) line. The H2 images cover
a 5' x 7' region around IRAS 4. Numerous H2 emission features were detected.
The northeast-southwest bipolar outflow driven by IRAS 4A was studied by
combining the H2 images with SiO maps published previously. The SiO-H2 outflows
are continuous on the southwestern side but show a gap on the northeastern
side. The southwestern outflow lobe curves smoothly, and the position angle
increases with the distance from the driving source. The base and the outer tip
of the northeastern outflow lobe are located at positions opposite to the
corresponding parts of the southwestern lobe. This point-symmetry suggests that
the outflow axis may be drifting or precessing clockwise in the plane of the
sky and that the cause of the axis drift may be intrinsic to the outflow
engine. The axis drift model is supported by the asymmetric lateral intensity
profile of the SiO outflow. The axis drift rate is about 0.011 deg yr-1. The
middle part of the northeastern outflow does not exactly follow the point
symmetry because of the superposition of two different kinds of directional
variability: the axis drift of the driving source and the deflection by a dense
core. The axis drift model provides a good explanation for the large deflection
angle of the northeastern outflow. Other H2 emission features around the IRAS 4
region are discussed briefly. Some of them are newly found outflows, and some
are associated with outflows already known before.",2006-04-19T04:09:16Z
Chaotic Feature in the Light Curve of 3C 273,"Some nonlinear dynamical techniques, including state-space reconstruction and
correlation integral, are used to analyze the light curve of 3C 273. The result
is compared with a chaotic model. The similarity between them suggests that
there is a low-dimensional chaotic attractor in the light curve of 3C 273.",2006-03-13T12:39:32Z
Black Holes: from Speculations to Observations,"This paper provides a brief review of the history of our understanding and
knowledge of black holes. Starting with early speculations on ``dark stars'' I
discuss the Schwarzschild ""black hole"" solution to Einstein's field equations
and the development of its interpretation from ""physically meaningless"" to
describing the perhaps most exotic and yet ""most perfect"" macroscopic object in
the universe. I describe different astrophysical black hole populations and
discuss some of their observational evidence. Finally I close by speculating
about future observations of black holes with the new generation of
gravitational wave detectors.",2006-04-13T14:50:52Z
A non-LTE abundance analysis of the post-AGB star ROA 5701,"An analysis of high-resolution Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT)/ University
College London Echelle Spectrograph (UCLES) optical spectra for the ultraviolet
(UV)-bright star ROA 5701 in the globular cluster omega Cen (NGC 5139) is
performed, using non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) model
atmospheres to estimate stellar atmospheric parameters and chemical
composition. Abundances are derived for C, N, O, Mg, Si and S, and compared
with those found previously by Moehler et al. We find a general metal
underabundance relative to young B-type stars, consistent with the average
metallicity of the cluster. Our results indicate that ROA 5701 has not
undergone a gas-dust separation scenario as previously suggested. However, its
abundance pattern does imply that ROA 5701 has evolved off the AGB prior to the
onset of the third dredge-up.",2006-05-09T11:13:27Z
Lifetime of nuclear velocity dispersion drops in barred galaxies,"We have made hydro/N-body simulations with and without star formation to shed
some light on the conditions under which a central kinematically cold stellar
component (characterized by a velocity dispersion drop or \sigma-drop) could be
created in a hot medium (e.g. a bulge) and survive enough time to be observed.
We found that the timescale for a \sigma-drop formation could be short (less
than 500 Myr) whereas its lifetime could be long (more than 1 Gyr) provided
that the central region is continuously or regularly fed by fresh gas which
leads to a continuous star formation activity. Star formation in the central
region, even at a low rate as 1M_{sol} yr^{-1}, is mandatory to sustain a
permanent \sigma-drop by replacing heated particles by new low-\sigma ones. We
moreover show that as soon as star formation is switched off, the \sigma-drop
begins to disappear.",2006-03-29T09:29:42Z
The VIMOS VLT Deep Survey: the faint type-1 AGN sample,"We present the type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGN) sample extracted from the
VIMOS VLT Deep Survey first observations of 21000 spectra in 1.75 square
degree. This sample, which is purely magnitude limited, free of morphological
or color selection biases, contains 130 broad line AGN (BLAGN) spectra with
redshift up to 5. Our data are divided into a wide (Iab < 22.5) and a deep (Iab
< 24) subsample containing 56 and 74 objects respectively. Because of its depth
and selection criteria, this sample is uniquely suited to study the population
of faint type-1 AGN. Our measured surface density (~ 472 +- 48 BLAGN per square
degree with Iab < 24) is significantly higher than that of any other optically
selected sample of BLAGN with spectroscopic confirmation. By applying a
morphological and color analysis to our AGN sample we find that: (1)~23% of the
AGN brighter than Iab=22.5 are classified as extended; this percentage
increases to ~42% for those with z < 1.6; (2) a non-negligible fraction of our
BLAGN are lying close to the color space area occupied by stars in u*-g' versus
g'-r' color-color diagram. This leads us to the conclusion that classical
optical ultraviolet preselection technique, if employed at such deep magnitudes
(Iab=22.5) in conjuction with a preselection of point-like sources, can miss
miss up to ~35% of the AGN population. Finally, we present a composite spectrum
of our sample of objects. While the continuum shape is very similar to that of
the SDSS composite at short wavelengths, it is much redder than it at lambda >
3000 A. We interpret this as due to significant contamination from emission of
the host galaxies, as expected from the faint absolute magnitudes sampled by
our survey.",2006-06-02T18:44:27Z
"Constraining Primordial Non-Gaussianities from the WMAP2 2-1 Cumulant
  Correlator Power Spectrum","We measure the 2-1 cumulant correlator power spectrum $C^{21}_l$, a
degenerate bispectrum, from the second data release of the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). Our high resolution measurements with SpICE span a
large configuration space ($\simeq 168\times999$) corresponding to the possible
cross-correlations of the maps recorded by the different differencing
assemblies. We present a novel method to recover the eigenmodes of the
correspondingly large Monte Carlo covariance matrix. We examine its eigenvalue
spectrum and use random matrix theory to show that the off diagonal terms are
dominated by noise. We minimize the $\chi^2$ to obtain constraints for the
non-linear coupling parameter $f_{NL} = 22 \pm 52 (1\sigma)$.",2006-06-16T01:58:34Z
Planetary Microlensing: From Prediction to Discovery,"Four planets have recently been discovered by gravitational microlensing. The
most recent of these discoveries is the lowest-mass planet known to exist
around a normal star. The detection of planets in gravitational microlensing
events was predicted over a decade ago. Microlensing is now a mature field of
astrophysical research and the recent planet detections herald a new chapter in
the hunt for low mass extra-solar planets. This paper reviews the basic theory
of planetary microlensing, describes the experiments currently in operation for
the detection and observation of microlensing events and compares the
characteristics of the planetary systems found to date by microlensing. Some
proposed schemes for improving the detection rate of planets via microlensing
are also discussed.",2006-04-04T13:57:31Z
TES imaging array technology for CLOVER,"CLOVER is an experiment which aims to detect the signature of gravitational
waves from inflation by measuring the B-mode polarization of the cosmic
microwave background. CLOVER consists of three telescopes operating at 97, 150,
and 220 GHz. The 97-GHz telescope has 160 horns in its focal plane while the
150 and 220-GHz telescopes have 256 horns each. The horns are arranged in a
hexagonal array and feed a polarimeter which uses finline-coupled TES
bolometers as detectors. To detect the two polarizations the 97-GHz telescope
has 320 detectors while the 150 and 220-GHz telescopes have 512 detectors each.
To achieve the required NEPs the detectors are cooled to 100 mK for the 97 and
150-GHz polarimeters and 230 mK for the 220-GHz polarimeter. Each detector is
fabricated as a single chip to guarantee fully functioning focal planes. The
detectors are contained in linear modules made of copper which form split-block
waveguides. The detector modules contain 16 or 20 detectors each for
compatibility with the hexagonal arrays of horns in the telescopes' focal
planes. Each detector module contains a time-division SQUID multiplexer to read
out the detectors. Further amplification of the multiplexed signals is provided
by SQUID series arrays. The first prototype detectors for CLOVER operate with a
bath temperature of 230 mK and are used to validate the detector design as well
as the polarimeter technology. We describe the design of the CLOVER detectors,
detector blocks, and readout, and give an update on the detector development.",2006-07-05T11:43:32Z
On the investigations of galaxy redshift periodicity,"In this article we present a historical review of study of the redshift
periodicity of galaxies, starting from the first works performed in the
seventies of the twentieth century until the present day. We discuss the
observational data and methods used, showing in which cases the discretization
of redshifts was observed. We conclude that galaxy redshift periodisation is an
effect which can really exist. We also discussed the redshift discretization in
two different structures: the Local Group of galaxies and the Hercules
Supercluster. Contrary to the previous studies we consider all galaxies which
can be regarded as a structure member disregarding the accuracy of velocity
measurements. We applied the power spectrum analysis using the Hann function
for weighting, together with the jackknife error estimator. In both the
structures we found weak effects of redshift periodisation.",2006-06-13T06:50:28Z
Type I and Two-Gap Superconductivity in Neutron Star Magnetism,"Neutron-star inner cores with several charged baryonic components are likely
to be analogues of the two-gap superconductor which is of current interest in
condensed-matter physics. Consequently, type I superconductivity is less
probable than type II but may nevertheless be present in some intervals of
matter density. The intermediate state structure formed at finite magnetic flux
densities after the superconducting transitions is subject to buoyancy,
frictional and neutron-vortex interaction forces. These are estimated and it is
shown that the most important frictional force is that produced by the stable
stratification of neutron-star matter, the irreversible process being diffusion
in the normal, finite magnetic-flux density, parts of the structure. The
length-scale of the structure, in directions perpendicular to the local
magnetic field is of crucial importance. For small scales, the flux comoves
with the neutron vortices, as do the proton vortices of a type II
superconductor. But for much larger length-scales, flux movement tends to that
expected for normal charged Fermi systems.",2006-06-30T13:30:54Z
"A Spitzer IRS Spectral Atlas of Luminous 8 micron Sources in the Large
  Magellanic Cloud","We present an atlas of Spitzer Space Telescope Infrared Spectrograph (IRS)
spectra of highly luminous, compact mid-infrared sources in the Large
Magellanic Cloud. Sources were selected on the basis of infrared colors and 8
micron (MSX) fluxes indicative of highly evolved, intermediate- to high-mass
stars with current or recent mass loss at large rates. We determine the
chemistry of the circumstellar envelope from the mid-IR continuum and spectral
features and classify the spectral types of the stars. In the sample of 60
sources, we find 21 Red Supergiants (RSGs), 16 C-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch
(AGB) stars, 11 HII regions, 4 likely O-rich AGB stars, 4 Galactic O-rich AGB
stars, 2 OH/IR stars, and 2 B[e] supergiants with peculiar IR spectra. We find
that the overwhelming majority of the sample AGB stars (with typical IR
luminosities ~1.0E4 L_sun) have C-rich envelopes, while the O-rich objects are
predominantly luminous RSGs with L_IR ~ 1.0E5 L_sun. We determine mean
bolometric corrections to the stellar K-band flux densities and find that for
carbon stars, the bolometric corrections depend on the infrared color, whereas
for RSGs, the bolometric correction is independent of IR color. Our results
reveal that objects previously classified as PNe on the basis of IR colors are
in fact compact HII regions with very red IRS spectra that include strong
atomic recombination lines and PAH emission features. We demonstrate that the
IRS spectral classes in our sample separate clearly in infrared color-color
diagrams that use combinations of 2MASS data and synthetic IRAC/MIPS fluxes
derived from the IRS spectra. On this basis, we suggest diagnostics to identify
and classify, with high confidence levels, IR-luminous evolved stars and HII
regions in nearby galaxies using Spitzer and near-infrared photometry.",2006-06-30T19:38:28Z
"An Association in the Aquila Star-Forming Region: High Resolution
  Infrared Spectroscopy of T Tauri Stars","We present the properties of a group of young stars associated with the
well-studied T Tauri star system AS 353, located in the Aquila star-forming
region. The association is identified using radial velocity measurements of
sample objects selected from the Herbig and Bell Catalog based on their spatial
proximity to AS 353. Radial velocities of nine objects were measured from
multi-epoch high-resolution (R~30,000) H-band spectra obtained with NIRSPEC on
Keck II. High-resolution K-band spectra were also obtained for most of the
sample objects. Spectral types and rotational velocities are determined for all
objects in the sample. The multi-epoch H-band spectra were examined for radial
velocity variations in order to detect possible spectroscopic binaries. Eight
of the nine objects have radial velocities that are consistent within the
1-sigma scatter of the sample. From their mean of -8.6 km/s these eight objects
have a standard deviation of 2 km/s, which suggests that the sample stars are
related. The ninth object shows significant radial velocity variations between
epochs, characteristic of a spectroscopic binary. The overall multiplicity of
the sample is high; we observed 13 stars in seven systems, identifying three
new candidate binary components in this project. Many of the spectra reveal
hydrogen emission lines typical of strong accretion processes, indicating that
most of these objects harbor circumstellar disks and are less than a few
million years old. We discuss possible interpretations of the enigmatic pure
emission line spectrum of HBC 684. This work represents the highest spectral
resolution infrared observations to date of these intriguing, nearby young
stars.",2006-04-24T16:45:38Z
"Small-scale magnetic buoyancy and magnetic pumping effects in a
  turbulent convection","We determine the nonlinear drift velocities of the mean magnetic field and
nonlinear turbulent magnetic diffusion in a turbulent convection. We show that
the nonlinear drift velocities are caused by the three kinds of the
inhomogeneities, i.e., inhomogeneous turbulence; the nonuniform fluid density
and the nonuniform turbulent heat flux. The inhomogeneous turbulence results in
the well-known turbulent diamagnetic and paramagnetic velocities. The nonlinear
drift velocities of the mean magnetic field cause the small-scale magnetic
buoyancy and magnetic pumping effects in the turbulent convection. These
phenomena are different from the large-scale magnetic buoyancy and magnetic
pumping effects which are due to the effect of the mean magnetic field on the
large-scale density stratified fluid flow. The small-scale magnetic buoyancy
and magnetic pumping can be stronger than these large-scale effects when the
mean magnetic field is smaller than the equipartition field. We discuss the
small-scale magnetic buoyancy and magnetic pumping effects in the context of
the solar and stellar turbulent convection. We demonstrate also that the
nonlinear turbulent magnetic diffusion in the turbulent convection is
anisotropic even for a weak mean magnetic field. In particular, it is enhanced
in the radial direction. The magnetic fluctuations due to the small-scale
dynamo increase the turbulent magnetic diffusion of the toroidal component of
the mean magnetic field, while they do not affect the turbulent magnetic
diffusion of the poloidal field.",2006-05-18T07:35:12Z
Exotic bulk viscosity and its influence on neutron star r-modes,"We investigate the effect of exotic matter in particular, hyperon matter on
neutron star properties such as equation of state (EoS), mass-radius
relationship and bulk viscosity. Here we construct equations of state within
the framework of a relativistic field theoretical model. As hyperons are
produced abundantly in dense matter, hyperon-hyperon interaction becomes
important and is included in this model. Hyperon-hyperon interaction gives rise
to a softer EoS which results in a smaller maximum mass neutron star compared
with the case without the interaction. Next we compute the coefficient of bulk
viscosity and the corresponding damping time scale due to the non-leptonic weak
process including $\Lambda$ hyperons. Further, we investigate the role of the
bulk viscosity on gravitational radiation driven r-mode instability in a
neutron star of given mass and temperature and find that the instability is
effectively suppressed.",2006-07-01T11:59:48Z
"Orbital elements, masses and distance of lambda Scorpii A and B
  determined with the Sydney University Stellar Interferometer and high
  resolution spectroscopy","The triple system HD158926 (lambda Sco) has been observed interferometrically
with the Sydney University Stellar Interferometer and the elements of the wide
orbit have been determined. These are significantly more accurate than the
previous elements found spectroscopically. The inclination of the wide orbit is
consistent with the inclination previously found for the orbit of the close
companion. The wide orbit also has low eccentricity, suggesting that the three
stars were formed at the same time.
  The brightness ratio between the two B stars was also measured at lambda =
442nm and 700nm. The brightness ratio and colour index are consistent with the
previous classification of lambda Sco A as B1.5 and lambda Sco B as B2.
Evolutionary models show that the two stars lie on the main sequence. Since
they have have the same age and luminosity class (IV) the mass-luminosity
relation can be used to determine the mass ratio of the two stars: M_B/M_A =
0.76+/-0.04.
  The spectroscopic data have been reanalyzed using the interferometric values
for P, T, e and omega, leading to revised values for a_1sin i and the mass
function. The individual masses can be found from the mass ratio, the mass
function, spectrum synthesis and the requirement that the age of both
components must be the same: M_A = 10.4+/-1.3 Msun and M_B = 8.1+/-1.0 Msun.
  The masses, angular semimajor axis and the period of the system can be used
to determine the dynamical parallax. We find the distance to lambda Sco to be
112+/-5 pc, which is approximately a factor of two closer than the HIPPARCOS
value of 216+/-42 pc.",2006-05-12T05:20:13Z
On the First Generation of Stars,"We argue that the first stars may have spanned the conventional mass range
rather than be identified with the Very Massive Objects (100-1000 solar masses)
favoured by numerical simulations. Specifically, we find that magnetic field
generation processes acting in the first protostellar systems suffice to
produce fields that exceed the threshold for MRI instability to operate and
thereby allow the MRI dynamo to generate equipartition-amplitude magnetic
fields on protostellar mass scales below 50 solar masses. Such fields allow
primordial star formation to occur at essentially any metallicity by regulating
angular momentum transfer, fragmentation, accretion and feedback in much the
same way as occurs in conventional molecular clouds.",2006-06-12T20:00:06Z
"The GRB 060218/SN 2006aj event in the context of other Gamma-Ray Burst
  Supernovae","The supernova SN 2006aj associated with GRB 060218 is the second-closest
GRB-SN observed to date (z=0.033). We present Very Large Telescope, Liverpool
Telescope, and Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope multi-color photometry of SN
2006aj. This supernova is found to be subluminous and rapidly evolving. Its
early light curve includes an additional wavelength-dependent component, which
can be interpreted as shock break-out. We compare the photometric evolution of
multi-band light curves with the corresponding properties of the present sample
of more than 10 GRB-SNe with precisely known redshifts. Using host-galaxy
extinction measurements, we derive extinction-corrected GRB-SN luminosities and
place SN 2006aj in the context of this GRB-selected supernova sample as well as
in the context of local stripped-envelope supernovae.",2006-05-02T15:45:45Z
Limit on the Neutrino Mass from the WMAP Three Year Data,"We derive an upper limit on the neutrino mass from the WMAP three-year data
alone by employing a deterministic minimisation method based on a grid search
in multi-parameter space. Assuming the flat LCDM model with power-law adiabatic
perturbations, we find the sum of m_nu < 2.0 eV in agreement with the result of
the WMAP team. This result, the limit being nearly the same as that from the
WMAP first-year data, means that the fundamental limit on the neutrino mass
obtainable from the cosmic microwave background alone is already nearly met, as
anticipated from the previous analysis. We also clarify the role of the
polarisation data in deriving the limit on the neutrino mass.",2006-05-15T14:50:14Z
"Constraining the population of 6 < z < 10 star-forming galaxies with
  deep near-IR images of lensing clusters","(abridged) We present the first results of our deep survey of lensing
clusters aimed at constraining the abundance of star-forming galaxies at
z~6-10. Deep near-IR photometry of two lensing clusters (A1835 and AC114) was
obtained with ISAAC/VLT. These images, combined with existing data in the
optical bands, including HST images, were used to select very high redshift
candidates at z>~6 among the optical-dropouts. We have identified 18(8) first
and second-category optical dropouts in A1835 (AC114), detected in more than
one filter up to H(Vega)~23.8 (AB~25.2,uncorrected for lensing). Among them,
8(5) exhibit homogeneous SEDs compatible with star-forming galaxies at z>~6,
and 5(1) are more likely intermediate-redshift EROs based on luminosity
considerations. We have also identified a number of fainter sources in these
fields fulfilling our photometric selection and located around the critical
lines. We use all these data to make a first attempt at constraining the
density of star-forming galaxies present at 6<z<10 using lensing clusters.
Taken at face value, it appears that the number of candidates found seems to be
higher than the one achieved in blank fields with similar photometric depth in
the near-IR. The luminosity function derived for z>6 candidates appears
compatible with that of LBGs at z~3. The turnover observed by Bouwens et al.
(2005) towards the bright end relative to the z~3 LF is not observed in this
sample. Also the upper limit for the UV SFR density at z~6-10 is compatible
with the usual values derived at z~5-6, but higher than the estimates obtained
in the NICMOS Ultra Deep Field (UDF). Increasing the number of blank and
lensing fields with ultra-deep near-IR photometry is essential to get more
accurate constraints on the abundance of z>6 galaxies.",2006-06-06T22:38:27Z
AEGIS: The Diversity of Bright Near-IR Selected Distant Red Galaxies,"We use deep and wide near infrared (NIR) imaging from the Palomar telescope
combined with DEEP2 spectroscopy and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Chandra
Space Telescope imaging to investigate the nature of galaxies that are red in
NIR colors. We locate these `distant red galaxies' (DRGs) through the color cut
(J-K)_{vega} > 2.3 over 0.7 deg^{2}, where we find 1010 DRG candidates down to
K_s = 20.5. We combine 95 high quality spectroscopic redshifts with photometric
redshifts from BRIJK photometry to determine the redshift and stellar mass
distributions for these systems, and morphological/structural and X-ray
properties for 107 DRGs in the Extended Groth Strip. We find that many bright
(J-K)_{vega}>2.3 galaxies with K_s<20.5 are at redshifts z<2, with 64% between
1<z<2. The stellar mass distributions for these galaxies is broad, ranging from
10^{9}-10^{12} M_solar, but with most z>2 systems massive with M_*>10^{11}
M_solar. HST imaging shows that the structural properties and morphologies of
DRGs are also diverse, with the majority elliptical/compact (57%), and the
remainder edge-on spirals (7%), and peculiar galaxies (29%). The DRGs at z <
1.4 with high quality spectroscopic redshifts are generally compact, with small
half light radii, and span a range in rest-frame optical properties. The
spectral energy distributions for these objects differ from higher redshift
DRGs: they are bluer by one magnitude in observed (I-J) color. A pure IR color
selection of high redshift populations is not sufficient to identify unique
populations, and other colors, or spectroscopic redshifts are needed to produce
homogeneous samples.",2006-07-11T21:43:11Z
"ELTs Adaptive Optics for Multi-Objects 3D Spectroscopy : Key Parameters
  and Design Rules","In the last few years, new Adaptive Optics [AO] techniques have emerged to
answer new astronomical challenges: Ground-Layer AO [GLAO] and Multi-Conjugate
AO [MCAO] to access a wider Field of View [FoV], Multi-Object AO [MOAO] for the
simultaneous observation of several faint galaxies, eXtreme AO [XAO] for the
detection of faint companions. In this paper, we focus our study to one of
these applications : high red-shift galaxy observations using MOAO techniques
in the framework of Extremely Large Telescopes [ELTs]. We present the
high-level specifications of a dedicated instrument. We choose to describe the
scientific requirements with the following criteria : 40% of Ensquared Energy
[EE] in H band (1.65um) and in an aperture size from 25 to 150 mas. Considering
these specifications we investigate different AO solutions thanks to Fourier
based simulations. Sky Coverage [SC] is computed for Natural and Laser Guide
Stars [NGS, LGS] systems. We show that specifications are met for NGS-based
systems at the cost of an extremely low SC. For the LGS approach, the option of
low order correction with a faint NGS is discussed. We demonstrate that, this
last solution allows the scientific requirements to be met together with a
quasi full SC.",2006-06-11T14:45:03Z
"Multiwavelength Observations of EXO 0748-676 - I. Reprocessing of X-ray
  Bursts","We present the first high time-resolution simultaneous X-ray, ultraviolet,
and optical observations of X-ray bursts in UY Vol, the optical counterpart of
the low mass X-ray binary EXO 0748-676, obtained with RXTE, HST, and Gemini-S.
Strong reprocessed signals are present in the ultraviolet (a factor of 4) and
optical (a factor of 2.5). These signals are lagged with respect to the X-rays
and appear significantly smeared as well. The addition of far-ultraviolet
coverage for one burst, together with the high quality of the dataset, allow
much tighter constraints upon the temperature and geometry of the reprocessing
region than previously possible. A single-zone black body reprocessing model
for this burst suggests a rise in temperatures during the burst from 18,000 to
35,000K and an emitting area comparable to that expected for the disk and/or
irradiated companion star. The lags, a mean of 4.0s and range of 2.5s, are
consistent with those expected within the binary. The single-zone black body
model cannot reproduce the ratio of optical to ultraviolet flux during the
burst, however. The discrepancy, corresponding to underpredicting the optical
by more than a factor of two, seems too large to explain with deviations from a
local black body spectrum and more likely indicates that a range of
reprocessing temperatures are required, as would be expected, with cooler
regions not contributing to the UV. Comparable results are derived from other
bursts, and in particular the lag and smearing both appear shorter when the
companion star is on the near side of the disk as predicted. The burst observed
by HST also yielded a spectrum of the reprocessed light. [Abridged]",2006-05-04T23:32:26Z
"Integral Field Unit Observations of NGC 891: Kinematics of the Diffuse
  Ionized Gas Halo","We present high and moderate spectral resolution spectroscopy of diffuse
ionized gas (DIG) emission in the halo of NGC 891. The data were obtained with
the SparsePak integral field unit at the WIYN Observatory. The wavelength
coverage includes the [NII]6548,6583, Halpha, and [SII]6716,6731 emission
lines. Position-velocity (PV) diagrams, constructed using spectra extracted
from four SparsePak pointings in the halo, are used to examine the kinematics
of the DIG. Using two independent methods, a vertical gradient in azimuthal
velocity is found to be present in the northeast quadrant of the halo, with
magnitude approximately 15-18 km/s/kpc, in agreement with results from HI
observations. The kinematics of the DIG suggest that this gradient begins at
approximately 1 kpc above the midplane. In another part of the halo, the
southeast quadrant, the kinematics are markedly different, and suggest rotation
at about 175 km/s, much slower than the disk but with no vertical gradient. We
utilize an entirely ballistic model of disk-halo flow in an attempt to
reproduce the kinematics observed in the northeast quadrant. Analysis shows
that the velocity gradient predicted by the ballistic model is far too shallow.
Based on intensity cuts made parallel to the major axis in the ballistic model
and an Halpha image of NGC 891 from the literature, we conclude that the DIG
halo is much more centrally concentrated than the model, suggesting that
hydrodynamics dominate over ballistic motion in shaping the density structure
of the halo. Velocity dispersion measurements along the minor axis of NGC 891
seem to indicate a lack of radial motions in the halo, but the uncertainties do
not allow us to set firm limits.",2006-04-27T22:11:54Z
"Constraining a double component dark energy model using type Ia
  supernovae data","A two-component fluid representing dark energy is studied. One of the
components has a polytropic form, while the other has a barotropic form. Exact
solutions are obtained and the cosmological parameters are constrained using
supernova type Ia data. In general, an open universe is predicted. A big rip
scenario is largely preferred, but the dispersion in the parameter space is
very high. Hence, even if scenarios without future singularities can not be
excluded with the allowed range of parameters, a phantom cosmology, with an
open spatial section, is a general prediction of the model. For a wide range of
the equation of state parameters there is an asymptotic de Sitter phase.",2006-06-07T20:03:58Z
Absolute timing of the Crab Pulsar at optical wavelengths with STJs,"We have observed the Crab Pulsar in the optical with S-Cam, an instrument
based on Superconducting Tunneling Junctions (STJs) with $\mu$s time
resolution. Our aim was to study the delay between the radio and optical pulse.
The Crab Pulsar was observed three times over a time span of almost 7 years, on
two different locations, using three different versions of the instrument, and
using two different GPS units. We consistently find that the optical peak leads
the radio peak by 49$\pm$90, 254$\pm$170, and 291$\pm$100 $\mu$s. On assumption
of a constant optical lead, the weighted-average value is $\sim$170 $\mu$s, or
when rejecting (based on a perhaps questionable radio ephemeris) the first
measurement, 273$\pm$100 $\mu$s.",2006-06-07T12:08:14Z
"Outer structure of the Galactic warp and flare: explaining the Canis
  Major over-density","(Abridged) We derive the structure of the Galactic stellar Warp and Flare
using 2MASS RC and RGB stars, selected at mean heliocentric distances of 3, 7
and 17 kpc.
  Our results are: (i) a clear stellar warp signature is derived for the 3
selected rings; (ii) the derived stellar warp is consistent (both in amplitude
and phase-angle) with that for the Galactic interstellar dust and HI gas; (iii)
the Sun seems not to fall on the line of nodes. The stellar warp phase-angle
orientation (+15 degrees) is close to the orientation angle of the Galactic bar
and this produces an asymmetric warp for the inner rings; (iv) a
Northern/Southern warp symmetry is observed only for the ring at 17 kpc; (v)
treating a mixture of thin and thick disk populations we trace the disk flaring
and derive a constant scale-height (~0.65 kpc) within R(GC)~15 kpc. Further
out, the disk flaring increase gradually reaching a mean scale-height of ~1.5
kpc at R(GC)~23 kpc; and (vi) these results provide further robust evidence
that there is no disk radial truncation at R(GC)~14 kpc.
  In the particular case of the Canis Major over-density we confirm its
coincidence with the Southern stellar maximum warp occurring near l=240. We
present evidence to conclude that all observed parameters (e.g. number density,
radial velocities, proper motion etc) of CMa are consistent with it being a
normal Milky Way outer-disk population, thereby leaving no justification for a
more complex interpretations of its origin. The present analysis does not
provide a conclusive test of the structure or origin of the Monoceros Ring.
Nevertheless, we show that a warped flared Milky Way contributes significantly
at the locations of the Monoceros Ring.",2006-03-15T09:29:55Z
The VIMOS VLT Deep Survey: the faint type-1 AGN sample,"We present the type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGN) sample extracted from the
VIMOS VLT Deep Survey first observations of 21000 spectra in 1.75 square
degree. This sample, which is purely magnitude limited, free of morphological
or color selection biases, contains 130 broad line AGN (BLAGN) spectra with
redshift up to 5. Our data are divided into a wide (Iab < 22.5) and a deep (Iab
< 24) subsample containing 56 and 74 objects respectively. Because of its depth
and selection criteria, this sample is uniquely suited to study the population
of faint type-1 AGN. Our measured surface density (~ 472 +- 48 BLAGN per square
degree with Iab < 24) is significantly higher than that of any other optically
selected sample of BLAGN with spectroscopic confirmation. By applying a
morphological and color analysis to our AGN sample we find that: (1)~23% of the
AGN brighter than Iab=22.5 are classified as extended; this percentage
increases to ~42% for those with z < 1.6; (2) a non-negligible fraction of our
BLAGN are lying close to the color space area occupied by stars in u*-g' versus
g'-r' color-color diagram. This leads us to the conclusion that classical
optical ultraviolet preselection technique, if employed at such deep magnitudes
(Iab=22.5) in conjuction with a preselection of point-like sources, can miss
miss up to ~35% of the AGN population. Finally, we present a composite spectrum
of our sample of objects. While the continuum shape is very similar to that of
the SDSS composite at short wavelengths, it is much redder than it at lambda >
3000 A. We interpret this as due to significant contamination from emission of
the host galaxies, as expected from the faint absolute magnitudes sampled by
our survey.",2006-06-02T18:44:27Z
AL 3 (BH 261): a new globular cluster in the Galaxy,"AL~3 (BH 261), previously classified as a faint open cluster candidate, is
shown to be a new globular cluster in the Milky Way, by means of B, V and I
Color-Magnitude Diagrams. The main feature of AL~3 is a prominent blue extended
Horizontal Branch. Its Color-Magnitude Diagrams match those of the intermediate
metallicity cluster M~5. The cluster is projected in a rich bulge field, also
contaminated by the disk main sequence. The globular cluster is located in the
Galactic bulge at a distance from the Sun d$_{\odot}$ = 6.0$\pm$0.5 kpc. The
reddening is E(B-V)=0.36$\pm$0.03 and the metallicity is estimated to be [Fe/H]
$\approx$ -1.3$\pm$0.25. AL~3 is probably one of the least massive globular
clusters of the Galaxy.",2006-06-29T12:33:57Z
Quasars at z=6: the survival of the fittest,"The Sloan Digital Sky survey detected luminous quasars at very high redshift,
z>6. Follow-up observations indicated that at least some of these quasars are
powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses in excess of billion
solar masses. SMBHs, therefore, seem to have already existed when the Universe
was less than 1 Gyr old, and the bulk of galaxy formation still has to take
place. We investigate in this paper to which extent accretion and dynamical
processes influence the early growth of SMBHs. We assess the impact of (i)
black hole mergers, (ii) the influence of the merging efficiency and (iii) the
negative contribution due to dynamical effects which can kick black holes out
of their host halos (gravitational recoil). We find that if accretion is always
limited by the Eddington rate via a thin disc, the maximum radiative efficiency
allowed to reproduce the LF at z=6 is of order 12%, when the adverse effect of
the gravitational recoil is taken into consideration. Dynamical effects cannot
be neglected in studies of high-redshift SMBHs. If black holes can accrete at
super-critical rate during an early phase, reproducing the observed SMBH mass
values is not an issue, even in the case that the recoil velocity is in the
upper limits range, as the mass ratios of merging binaries are skewed towards
low values, where the gravitational recoil effect is very mild. We propose that
SMBH growth at early times is very selective, and efficient only for black
holes hosted in high density peak halos.",2006-07-05T23:23:33Z
"On the consistency of the peculiar GRBs 060218 and 060614 with the Ep,i
  - Eiso correlation","We analyze and discuss the position of GRB 060218 and GRB 060614 in the Ep,i
- Eiso plane. GRB 060218 is important because of its similarity with GRB
980425, the proto-type event of the GRB-SN connection. While GRB 980425 is an
outlier of the Ep,i - Eiso correlation, we find that GRB 060218 is fully
consistent with it. This evidence, combined with the `chromatic' behavior of
the afterglow light curves, is at odds with the hypothesis that GRB 060218 was
a `standard' GRB seen off-axis and supports the existence of a class of truly
sub--energetic GRBs. GRB 060614 is a peculiar event not accompanied by a bright
Supernova. Based on published spectral information, we find that also this
event is consistent with the Ep,i - Eiso correlation. We discuss the
implications of our results for the rate of sub--energetic GRBs, the GRB/SN
connection and the properties of the newly discovered sub-class of long GRBs
not associated with bright Supernovae. We have included in our analysis other
recent GRBs with clear evidence (or clear no evidence) of associated SNe.",2006-07-07T19:14:29Z
"Causes of Observed Long-Periodic Variations of the Polarization at Polar
  Regions of Jupiter","Data of 23-years of Jupiter polarimetric observations (1981- 2004) have been
reprocessed using new improved technique. The data from other observers have
been added to the analysis (1971-74). Anticorrelation between asymmetry of
polarization and insolation has been found. The mechanism of influence of
seasons changing (through temperature variations) on north-south asymmetry of
polarization formation has been proposed. Also a possibility of existence of
influence of solar cosmic rays flux on polarization value is noted.",2006-07-10T14:30:22Z
The Red Halo Phenomenon,"Optical and near-IR observations of the halos of disk galaxies and blue
compact galaxies have revealed a very red spectral energy distribution, which
cannot easily be reconciled with a normal, metal-poor stellar population like
that in the stellar halo of the Milky Way. Here, spectral evolutionary models
are used to explore the consequences of these observations. We demonstrate that
a stellar population of low to intermediate metallicity, but with an extremely
bottom-heavy initial mass function, can explain the red halos around both types
of objects. Other previously suggested explanations, like nebular emission or
very metal-rich stars, are shown to fail in this respect. This indicates that,
if the reported halo colours are correct, halo populations dominated by
low-mass stars may be a phenomenon common to galaxies of very different Hubble
types. Potential tests of this hypothesis are discussed, along with its
implications for the baryonic dark matter content of galaxies.",2006-06-09T06:11:43Z
Is Radiation of Quantized Black Holes Observable?,"If primordial black holes (PBH) saturate the present upper limit on the dark
matter density in our Solar system and if their radiation spectrum is discrete,
the sensitivity of modern detectors is close to that necessary for detecting
this radiation. This conclusion is not in conflict with the upper limits on the
PBH evaporation rate.",2006-04-01T05:25:06Z
On the status of superheavy dark matter,"Superheavy particles are a natural candidate for the dark matter in the
universe and our galaxy, because they are produced generically during inflation
in cosmologically interesting amounts. The most attractive model for the origin
of superheavy dark matter (SHDM) is gravitational production at the end of
inflation. The observed cosmological density of dark matter determines the mass
of the SHDM particle as $m_X=$(a few)$\:\times 10^{13}$ GeV, promoting it to a
natural candidate for the source of the observed ultra-high energy cosmic rays
(UHECR). After a review of the theoretical aspects of SHDM, we up-date its
predictions for UHECR observations: no GZK cutoff, flat energy spectrum with
$dN/dE\approx 1/E^{1.9}$, photon dominance and galactic anisotropy. We analyze
the existing data and conclude that SDHM as explanation for the observed UHECRs
is at present disfavored but not yet excluded. We calculate the anisotropy
relevant for future Auger observations that should be the conclusive test for
this model. Finally, we emphasize that negative results of searches for SHDM in
UHECR do not disfavor SHDM as a dark matter candidate. Therefore, UHECRs
produced by SHDM decays and with the signatures as described should be searched
for in the future as subdominant effect.",2006-04-13T17:13:54Z
The CMB as a dark energy probe,"We give a brief review of the known effects of a dynamical vacuum
cosmological component, the dark energy, on the anisotropies of the cosmic
microwave background (CMB). We distinguish between a ""classic"" class of
observables, used so far to constrain the average of the dark energy abundance
in the redshift interval in which it is relevant for acceleration, and a
""modern"" class, aiming at the measurement of its differential redshift
behavior. We show that the gravitationally lensed CMB belongs to the second
class, as it can give a measure of the dark energy abundance at the time of
equality with matter, occurring at about redshift 0.5. Indeed, the dark energy
abundance at that epoch influences directly the lensing strength, which is
injected at about the same time, if the source is the CMB. We illustrate this
effect focusing on the curl (BB) component of CMB polarization, which is
dominated by lensing on arcminute angular scales. An increasing dark energy
abundance at the time of equality with matter, parameterized by a rising first
order redshift derivative of its equation of state today, makes the BB power
dropping with respect to a pure LambdaCDM cosmology, keeping the other
cosmological parameters and primordial amplitude fixed. We briefly comment on
the forthcoming probes which might measure the lensing power on CMB.",2006-06-03T20:00:20Z
"Outgassing of Ordinary Chondritic Material and Some of its Implications
  for the Chemistry of Asteroids, Planets, and Satellites","We used chemical equilibrium calculations to model thermal outgassing of
ordinary chondritic material as a function of temperature, pressure, and bulk
compositions and use our results to discuss outgassing on asteroids and the
early Earth. The calculations include ~1,000 solids and gases of the elements
Al, C, Ca, Cl, Co, Cr, F, Fe, H, K, Mg, Mn, N, Na, Ni, O, P, S, Si, and Ti. The
major outgassed volatiles from ordinary chondritic material are CH4, H2, H2O,
N2, and NH3(the latter at conditions where hydrous minerals form). Contrary to
widely held assumptions, CO is never the major C-bearing gas during ordinary
chondrite metamorphism. The calculated oxygen fugacity (partial pressure) of
ordinary chondritic material is close to that of the quartz-fayalite-iron (QFI)
buffer. Our results are insensitive to variable total pressure, variable
volatile element abundances, and kinetic inhibition of C and N dissolution in
Fe metal. Our results predict that Earth's early atmosphere contained CH4, H2,
H2O, N2, and NH3; similar to that used in Miller-Urey synthesis of organic
compounds.",2006-06-27T22:33:19Z
Free-free absorption in the gravitational lens JVAS B0218+357,"We address the issue of anomalous image flux ratios seen in the double-image
gravitational lens JVAS B0218+357. From the multi-frequency observations
presented in a recent study (Mittal et al. 2006) and several previous
observations made by other authors, the anomaly is well-established in that the
image flux-density ratio (A/B) decreases from 3.9 to 2.0 over the observed
frequency range from 15 GHz to 1.65 GHz. In Mittal et al. (2006), the authors
investigated whether an interplay between a frequency-dependent structure of
the background radio-source and a gradient in the relative image-magnification
can explain away the anomaly. Insufficient shifts in the image centroids with
frequency led them to discard the above effect as the cause of the anomaly. In
this paper, we first take this analysis further by evaluating the combined
effect of the background source extension and magnification gradients in the
lens plane in more detail. This is done by making a direct use of the observed
VLBI flux-distributions for each image to estimate the image flux-density
ratios at different frequencies from a lens-model. As a result of this
investigation, this mechanism does not account for the anomaly. Following this,
we analyze the effects of mechanisms which are non-gravitational in nature on
the image flux ratios in B0218+357. These are free-free absorption and
scattering, and are assumed to occur under the hypothesis of a molecular cloud
residing in the lens galaxy along the line-of-sight to image A. We show that
free-free absorption due to an H II region covering the entire structure of
image A at 1.65 GHz can explain the image flux ratio anomaly. We also discuss
whether H II regions with physical parameters as derived from our analysis are
consistent with those observed in Galactic and extragalactic H II regions.",2006-07-27T18:42:30Z
Radio Images of 3C 58: Expansion and Motion of its Wisp,"New 1.4 GHz VLA observations of the pulsar-powered supernova remnant 3C 58
have resulted in the highest-quality radio images of this object to date. The
images show filamentary structure over the body of the nebula. The present
observations were combined with earlier ones from 1984 and 1991 to investigate
the variability of the radio emission on a variety of time-scales. No
significant changes are seen over a 110 day interval. In particular, the upper
limit on the apparent projected velocity of the wisp is 0.05c. The expansion
rate of the radio nebula was determined between 1984 and 2004, and is
0.014+/-0.003%/year, corresponding to a velocity of 630+/-70 km/s along the
major axis. If 3C 58 is the remnant of SN 1181, it must have been strongly
decelerated, which is unlikely given the absence of emission from the supernova
shell. Alternatively, the low expansion speed and a number of other arguments
suggest that 3C 58 may be several thousand years old and not be the remnant of
SN 1181.",2006-03-08T19:02:12Z

how well different proposed models fit the observed cluster mass distribution,

Characterizing Charge Diffusion in CCDs with X-rays,"We demonstrate the effectiveness of two techniques for using x-rays to
evaluate the amount of charge diffusion in charge coupled devices (CCDs). We
quantify the degree of charge diffusion with two parameters: sigma_d, the
standard deviation for a Gaussian diffusion model, and Q, a ratio of the point
spread function (PSF) peak to its wings. sigma_d and Q are determined by
fitting a model to a pixel energy histogram, and by summing the PSF of all
x-ray events, respectively. Using seven test devices, we investigate the
precision of these two techniques and demonstrate that they produce compatible
results. The histogram fitting method is sensitive to the structure of the
electric field within these devices, in addition to the inherent charge
diffusion properties. The Q ratio is a very simple parameter to measure and
provides an easily accessible method for quickly evaluating a CCD's diffusion
length.",2006-04-14T00:31:33Z
Mapping the ionizing sources with CMB polarization measurements,"We show that the delay of structure formation from WMAP3 can not fully
account for the reduction of electron optical depth from WMAP1 to WMAP3 when
the radiative transfer effects and feedback mechanisms are took into account in
computing the reionization history of the Universe. As the ultimate limit in
constraining the reionizatin history of the Universe with Planck will be placed
by the our understanding of systematic effects and foregrounds removal, we
discuss also these aspects.",2006-05-20T10:28:57Z
"Baryon Dynamics, Dark Matter Substructure, and Galaxies","By comparing a collisionless cosmological N-body simulation (DM) to an SPH
simulation with the same initial conditions, we investigate the correspondence
between the dark matter subhalos produced by collisionless dynamics and the
galaxies produced by dissipative gas dynamics in a dark matter background. When
galaxies in the SPH simulation become satellites in larger groups, they retain
local dark matter concentrations (SPH subhalos) whose mass is typically five
times their baryonic mass. The more massive subhalos of the SPH simulation have
corresponding subhalos of similar mass and position in the DM simulation; at
lower masses, there is fairly good correspondence, but some DM subhalos are in
different spatial positions and some suffer tidal stripping or disruption. The
halo occupation statistics of DM subhalos -- the mean number of subhalos,
pairs, and triples as a function of host halo mass -- are very similar to those
of SPH subhalos and SPH galaxies. Gravity of the dissipative baryon component
amplifies the density contrast of subhalos in the SPH simulation, making them
more resistant to tidal disruption. Relative to SPH galaxies and SPH subhalos,
the DM subhalo population is depleted in the densest regions of the most
massive halos. The good agreement of halo occupation statistics between the DM
subhalo and SPH galaxy populations leads to good agreement of their two-point
correlation functions and higher order moments on large scales. The depletion
of DM subhalos in dense regions depresses their clustering at R<1 Mpc/h. In
these simulations, the ""conversation"" between dark matter and baryons is mostly
one-way, with dark matter dynamics telling galaxies where to form and how to
cluster, but the ""back talk"" of the baryons influences small scale clustering
by enhancing the survival of substructure in the densest environments.",2006-04-18T21:32:24Z
Radial Velocity Studies of Close Binary Stars. XI,"Radial-velocity measurements and sine-curve fits to the orbital radial
velocity variations are presented for ten close binary systems: DU Boo, ET Boo,
TX Cnc, V1073 Cyg, HL Dra, AK Her, VW LMi, V566 Oph, TV UMi and AG Vir. By this
contribution, the DDO program has reached the point of 100 published radial
velocity orbits. The radial velocities have been determined using an improved
fitting technique which uses rotational profiles to approximate individual
peaks in broadening functions.
  Three systems, ET Boo, VW LMi and TV UMi, were found to be quadruple while AG
Vir appears to be a spectroscopic triple. ET Boo, a member of a close visual
binary with $P_{vis} = 113$ years, was previously known to be a multiple
system, but we show that the second component is actually a close,
non-eclipsing binary. The new observations enabled us to determine the
spectroscopic orbits of the companion, non-eclipsing pairs in ET Boo and VW
LMi. The particularly interesting case is VW LMi, where the period of the
mutual revolution of the two spectroscopic binaries is only 355 days.
  While most of the studied eclipsing pairs are contact binaries, ET Boo is
composed of two double-lined detached binaries and HL Dra is single-lined
detached or semi-detached system. Five systems of this group were observed
spectroscopically before: TX Cnc, V1073 Cyg, AK Her (as a single-lined binary),
V566 Oph, AG Vir, but our new data are of much higher quality than the previous
studies.",2006-05-15T11:35:04Z
"The host galaxy/AGN connection in nearby early-type galaxies. A new view
  of the origin of the radio-quiet/radio-loud dichotomy?","[ABRIDGED] This is the third in a series of three papers exploring the
connection between the multiwavelength properties of AGN in nearby early-type
galaxies and the characteristics of their hosts. We selected 116 AGN candidates
requiring a radio flux of 1 mJy. We classified the objects with HST images into
``core'' and ``power-law'' galaxies, on the basis of the nuclear slope of their
brightness profiles. We used HST and Chandra data to isolate their nuclear
emission to study the multiwavelength behaviour of their nuclei. The properties
of the nuclei hosted by the 29 core galaxies were presented in Paper II. Core
galaxies invariably host a radio-loud nucleus, with a median radio-loudness of
Log R = 3.6 and an X-ray based radio loudness parameter of Log R,X = -1.3. Here
we discuss the properties of the nuclei of the 22 ``power-law'' galaxies. They
show a substantial excess of optical and X-ray emission with respect to core
galaxies at the same level of radio luminosity. Conversely, their
radio-loudness parameters, Log R ~ 1.6 and Log R,X ~ -3.3, are similar to those
measured in Seyfert galaxies. Thus the radio-loudness of AGN hosted by
early-type galaxies appears to be univocally related to the host's brightness
profile: radio-loud AGN are only hosted by core galaxies, while radio-quiet AGN
are found only in power-law galaxies. The brightness profile is determined by
the galaxy's evolution, through its merger history; our results suggest that

  X-ray flares on gas-phase chemistry","Context. Recent observations of the X-ray emission from T Tauri stars in the
Orion nebula have shown that they undergo frequent outbursts in their X-ray
luminosity. These X-ray flares are characterised by increases in luminosity by
two orders of magnitude, a typical duration of less than one day, and a
significant hardening of the X-ray spectrum.
  Aims. It is unknown what effect these X-ray flares will have on the
ionisation fraction and dead-zone structure in protoplanetary disks. We present
the results of calculations designed to address this question.
  Methods. We have performed calculations of the ionisation fraction in a
standard $\alpha$-disk model using two different chemical reaction networks. We
include in our models ionisation due to X-rays from the central star, and
calculate the time-dependent ionisation fraction and dead--zone structure for
the inner 10 AU of a protoplanetary disk model.
  Results. We find that the disk response to X-ray flares depends on whether
the plasma temperature increases during flares and/or whether heavy metals
(such as magnesium) are present in the gas phase. Under favourable conditions
the outer disk dead--zone can disappear altogether,and the dead-zone located
between 0.5 < R < 2 AU can disappear and reappear in phase with the X-ray
luminosity.
  Conclusions. X-ray flares can have a significant effect on the dead-zone
structure in protoplanetary disks. Caution is required in interpreting this
result as the duration of X-ray bursts is considerably shorter than the growth
time of MHD turbulence due to the magnetorotational instability.",2006-05-11T13:57:34Z
Nearby debris disk systems with high fractional luminosity reconsidered,"By searching the IRAS and ISO databases we compiled a list of 60 debris disks
which exhibit the highest fractional luminosity values (fd>10^-4) in the
vicinity of the Sun (d<120pc). Eleven out of these 60 systems are new
discoveries. Special care was taken to exclude bogus disks from the sample. We
computed the fractional luminosity values using available IRAS, ISO, and
Spitzer data, and analysed the galactic space velocities of the objects. The
results revealed that stars with disks of high fractional luminosity often
belong to young stellar kinematic groups, providing an opportunity to obtain
improved age estimates for these systems. We found that practically all disks
with fd>5x10^-4 are younger than 100Myr. The distribution of the disks in the
fractional luminosity versus age diagram indicates that (1) the number of old
systems with high fd is lower than was claimed before; (2) there exist many
relatively young disks of moderate fractional luminosity; and (3) comparing the
observations with a current theoretical model of debris disk evolution a
general good agreement could be found.",2006-03-27T15:33:52Z
"New methods for approximating general relativity in numerical
  simulations of stellar core collapse","We review various approaches to approximating general relativistic effects in
hydrodynamic simulations of stellar core collapse and post-bounce evolution.
Different formulations of a modified Newtonian gravitational potential are
presented. Such an effective relativistic potential can be used in an otherwise
standard Newtonian hydrodynamic code. An alternative approximation of general
relativity is the assumption of conformal flatness for the three-metric, and
its extension by adding second post-Newtonian order terms. Using a code which
evolves the coupled system of metric and fluid equations, we apply the various
approximation methods to numerically simulate axisymmetric models for the
collapse of rotating massive stellar cores. We compare the collapse dynamics
and gravitational wave signals (which are extracted using the quadrupole
formula), and thereby assess the quality of the individual approximation
method. It is shown that while the use of an effective relativistic potential
already poses a significant improvement compared to a genuinely Newtonian
approach, the two conformal-flatness-based approximation methods yield even
more accurate results, which are qualitatively and quantitatively very close to
those of a fully general relativistic code even for rotating models which
almost collapse to a black hole.",2006-03-28T11:43:15Z
"A High Order Godunov Scheme with Constrained Transport and Adaptive Mesh
  Refinement for Astrophysical MHD","In this paper, we present a new method to perform numerical simulations of
astrophysical MHD flows using the Adaptive Mesh Refinement framework and
Constrained Transport. The algorithm is based on a previous work in which the
MUSCL--Hancock scheme was used to evolve the induction equation. In this paper,
we detail the extension of this scheme to the full MHD equations and discuss
its properties. Through a series of test problems, we illustrate the
performances of this new code using two different MHD Riemann solvers
(Lax-Friedrich and Roe) and the need of the Adaptive Mesh Refinement
capabilities in some cases. Finally, we show its versatility by applying it to
two completely different astrophysical situations well studied in the past
years: the growth of the magnetorotational instability in the shearing box and
the collapse of magnetized cloud cores. We have implemented this new Godunov
scheme to solve the ideal MHD equations in the AMR code RAMSES. It results in a
powerful tool that can be applied to a great variety of astrophysical problems,
ranging from galaxies formation in the early universe to high resolution
studies of molecular cloud collapse in our galaxy.",2006-07-11T15:12:04Z
A Photonic mm-Wave Local Oscillator,"A photonic millimeter wave local oscillator capable of producing two
microwatts of radiated power at 224 GHz has been developed. The device was
tested in one antenna of Smithsonian Institution's Submillimeter Array (SMA)
and was found to produce stable phase on multiple baselines. Graphical data is
presented of correlator output phase and amplitude stability. A description of
the system is given in both open and closed loop modes. A model is given which
is used to predict the operational behavior. A novel method is presented to
determine the safe operating point of the automated system.",2006-05-31T02:18:13Z
Spitzer Spectra of Magellanic Cloud PNe,"Planetary nebulae (PNe) in the Magellanic Clouds (LMC, SMC) offer a unique
opportunity to study both the population and evolution of low- and
intermediate-mass stars in an environment which is free of the distance scale
bias that hinder Galactic PN studies. The emission shown by PNe in the 5-40
$\mu$m range is characterized by the presence of a combination of solid state
features (from the dust grains) and nebular emission lines over-imposed on a
strong dust continuum. We acquired low resolution IRS spectroscopy of a
selected sample of LMC and SMC PNe whose morphology, size, central star
brightness, and chemical composition are known. The data have been acquired and
reduced, and the IRS spectra show outstanding quality as well as very
interesting features. The preliminary analysis presented here allows to
determine strong correlations between gas and dust composition, and nebular
morphology. More detailed analysis in the future will deepen our knowledge of
mass-loss mechanism, its efficiency, and its relation to PN morphology.",2006-05-30T23:41:33Z
"Extragalactic chemistry of molecular gas: lessons from the local
  universe","Observational constraints provided by high resolution and high sensitivity
observations of external galaxies made in the millimeter and submillimeter
range have started to put on a firm ground the study of extragalactic chemistry
of molecular gas. In particular, the availability of multi-species and
multi-line surveys of nearby galaxies is central to the interpretation of
existent and forthcoming millimeter observations of the high redshift universe.
Probing the physical and chemical status of molecular gas in starbursts and
active galaxies (AGN) requires the use of specific tracers of the relevant
energetic phenomena that are known to be at play in these galaxies: large-scale
shocks, strong UV fields, cosmic rays and X-rays. We present below the first
results of an ongoing survey, allying the IRAM 30m telescope with the Plateau
de Bure interferometer(PdBI), devoted to study the chemistry of molecular gas
in a sample of starbursts and AGN of the local universe. These observations
highlight the existence of a strong chemical differentiation in the molecular
disks of starbursts and AGN.",2006-05-24T11:41:23Z
"Study of time lags in HETE-2 Gamma-Ray Bursts with redshift: search for
  astrophysical effects and Quantum Gravity signature","The study of time lags between spikes in Gamma-Ray Burst light curves in
different energy bands as a function of redshift may lead to the detection of
effects due to Quantum Gravity. We present an analysis of 15 Gamma-Ray Bursts
with measured redshift, detected by the HETE-2 mission in order to measure time
lags related to astrophysical effects and search for Quantum Gravity signature
in the framework of an extra-dimension string model. The wavelet transform
method is used both for de-noising the light curves and for the detection of
sharp transitions. The use of photon tagged data allows us to consider various
energy ranges and to evaluate systematic effects due to selections and cuts.
The analysis of maxima and minima of the light curves leads to no significant
Quantum Gravity effect. A lower limit at 95% Confidence Level on the Quantum
Gravity scale parameter of 2x10**15 GeV is set.",2006-03-27T14:39:01Z
Is Radiation of Quantized Black Holes Observable?,"If primordial black holes (PBH) saturate the present upper limit on the dark
matter density in our Solar system and if their radiation spectrum is discrete,
the sensitivity of modern detectors is close to that necessary for detecting
this radiation. This conclusion is not in conflict with the upper limits on the
PBH evaporation rate.",2006-04-01T05:25:06Z
HI 21cm Absorption at $z \sim 2.347$ towards PKS B0438-436,"We report the detection of redshifted HI~21cm absorption in the $z \sim
2.347$ damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorber (DLA) towards PKS B0438-436, with the
Green Bank Telescope. This is the second-highest redshift at which 21cm
absorption has been detected in a DLA. The absorption extends over $\sim 60$
km/s and has two distinct components, at $z = 2.347477 (12)$ and $z = 2.347869
(20)$. A similar velocity structure is seen in optical metal lines, although
the peak absorption here is offset by $\sim 11$ km/s from the peak in the 21cm
line. We obtain a high spin temperature $T_s \sim (886 \pm 248) \times
(f/0.58)$ K, using a covering factor estimated from 2.3 GHz VLBI data. However,
the current data cannot rule out a low spin temperature. The non-detection of
CO 3-2 absorption places the upper limit $N_{CO} < 3.8 \times 10^{15} \times
(T_x/10)$ cm$^{-2}$ on the CO column density.",2006-05-14T23:32:55Z
"Color-Magnitude Diagrams of Resolved Stars in Virgo Cluster Dwarf
  Galaxies","The Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on HST has been used to image two
fields in the core of the Virgo cluster that contain a number of dwarf
elliptical galaxies. The combined F555W and F814W images have resolved red
giant stars in these galaxies, down to 1 mag below the giant branch tip. Two of
the galaxies were targeted because of their extremely low central surface
brightnesses (Bo > 27.0), thus the successful resolution into stars confirms
the existence of such tenuous galaxies. Red giant stars were also found that
are not ostensibly associated with any galaxy. Color-magnitude diagrams in V
and I have been derived and used to derive distances and metallicities via the
magnitude and mean color of the red giant branch tip. The mean abundances of
stars in the dwarfs range from -1.2 [Fe/H] < -2.4, and fall along the relation
between galaxy luminosity and metallicity found for Local Group and M81 group
dwarf ellipticals. The mean distance modulus of the six Virgo galaxies is 31.0
+/- 0.05, or 16.1 +/- 0.4 Mpc, whereas that for the intracluster stars in those
fields is 31.2 +/- 0.09 (17.4 +/- 0.7 Mpc).",2006-07-20T17:33:29Z
"Mass segregation in rich LMC clusters from modelling of deep HST
  colour-magnitude diagrams","We used the deep colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of five rich LMC clusters
(NGC1805, 1818, 1831, 1868, and Hodge14) observed with HST/WFPC2 to derive
their present day mass function (PDMF) and its variation with position within
the cluster. The PDMF was parameterized as a power law in the available
main-sequence mass range of each cluster, typically 0.9 <~ m/M_sun <~ 2.5; its
slope was determined at different positions spanning from the very centre out
to several core radii. The CMDs in the central regions of the clusters were
carefully studied earlier, resulting in accurate age, metallicity, distance
modulus, and reddening values. The slope alpha (where Salpeter is 2.35) was
determined in annuli by following two distinct methods: 1) a power law fit to
the PDMF obtained from the systemic luminosity function (LF); 2) a statistical
comparison between observed and model CMDs. In all clusters, significant mass
segregation is found from the positional dependence of the PDMF slope: alpha <~
1.8 for R <= 1.0 R_core and alpha ~ Salpeter inside R=2~3 R_core (except for
Hodge 14, where alpha ~ Salpeter for R ~ 4 R_core). The results are robust in
the sense that they hold true for both methods used. The CMD method reveals
that unresolved binaries flatten the PDMF obtained form the systemic LF, but
this effect is smaller than the uncertainties in the alpha determination. For
each cluster we estimated dynamical ages inside the core and for the entire
system. In both cases we found a trend in the sense that older clusters have
flatter PDMF, consistent with a dynamical mass segregation and stellar
evaporation.",2006-04-28T19:35:45Z
The Evolution of Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae,"The evolution of central stars of planetary nebulae can proceed in several
distinct ways, either leading to H-deficiency or to H-normal surface
composition. Several new simulations of the evolution channels that lead to
H-deficiency are now available, mainly the born-again scenarios that are
triggered by a He-shell flash during the hot pre-white dwarf evolution phase. A
realistic AGB progenitor evolution is important for correct HRD tracks, that
allow mass determinations. New hydrodynamic simulations of He-shell flash
convection including cases with H-ingestion are now performed, and allow a
determination of the convective extra-mixing efficiency. This has direct
consequences for the intershell abundance distribution of AGB stars that can be
observed in the H-deficient CSPN.",2006-06-23T20:58:45Z
"Two evolutional paths of an axisymmetric gravitational instability in
  the dust layer of a protoplanetary disk","Nonlinear numerical simulations are performed to investigate the density
evolution in the dust layer of a protoplanetary disk due to the gravitational
instability and dust settling toward the midplane. We assume the region where
the radial pressure gradient at equilibrium is negligible so that the
shear-induced instability is avoided, and also restrict to an axisymmetric
perturbation as a first step of nonlinear numerical simulations of the
gravitational instability. We find that there are two different evolutional
paths of the gravitational instability depending on the nondimensional gas
friction time, which is defined as the product of the gas friction time and the
Keplerian angular velocity. If the nondimensional gas friction time is equal to
0.01, the gravitational instability grows faster than dust settling. On the
other hand, if the nondimensional gas friction time is equal to 0.1, dust
aggregates settle sufficiently before the gravitational instability grows. In
the latter case, an approximate analytical calculation reveals that dust
settling is faster than the growth of the gravitational instability regardless
of the dust density at the midplane. Thus, the dust layer becomes extremely
thin and may reach a few tenth of the material density of the dust before the
gravitational instability grows.",2006-05-08T08:21:38Z
QSO Absorption Lines from QSOs,"We present the results of a search for metal absorption lines in the spectra
of background QSOs whose sightlines pass close to foreground QSOs. We detect
MgII(2796,2803) absorption in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra of four
z>1.5 QSOs whose lines of sight pass within 26-98 kpc of lower redshift
(z~0.5-1.5) QSOs. The 100% [4/4 pairs] detection of MgII in the background QSOs
is clearly at odds with the incidence of associated (z_abs ~ z_em) systems --
absorbers which exist towards only a few percent of QSOs. Although the quality
of our foreground QSO spectra is not as high as the SDSS data, absorption seen
towards one of the background QSOs clearly does not show up at the same
strength in the spectrum of the corresponding foreground QSO. This implies that
the absorbing gas is distributed inhomogeneously around the QSO, presumably as
a direct consequence of the anisotropic emission from the central AGN. We
discuss possible origins for the MgII lines, including: absorption by gas from
the foreground QSO host galaxy; companion galaxies fuelling the QSO through
gravitational interactions; and tidal debris left by galaxy mergers or
interactions which initiated the QSO activity. No single explanation is
entirely satisfactory, and we may well be seeing a mixture of phenomena.",2006-05-30T21:00:46Z
Analysis to the entangled states from an extended Chaplygin gas model,"With considerations of the recently released WMAP year three and supernova
legacy survey (SNLS) data set analysis that favors models similar to the $%
\Lambda CDM$ model by possibly mild fluctuations around the vacuum energy or
the cosmological constant, we extend the original Chaplygin Gas model (ECG) via
modifying the Chaplygin Gas equation of state by two parameters to describe an
entangled mixture state from an available matter and the rest component (which
can take the cosmological constant or dark energy as in the current cosmic
stage, or `curvature-like' term, or radiation component in the early epoch, as
various phases) coexistence. At low redshifts, the connection of the ECG model
and the Born-infeld field is set up. As paradigms, we use the data coming from
the recently released SNLS for the first year and also the famous 157 type Ia
supernova (Ia SNe) gold dataset to constrain the model parameters. The
restricted results demonstrate clearly how large the entangled degree or the
ratio between the energy density parameters of the two entangled phases being.
The fact that the ECG models are consistent with the observations of Ia SNe is
obtained through the redshift-luminosity distance diagram, hence the ECG can be
regarded possible candidates for mimicking the current speed-up expansion of
our universe.",2006-05-29T08:06:29Z
"A non-linear resonance model for the black hole and neutron star QPOs:
  theory supported by observations","Kilohertz Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) have been detected in many
accreting X-ray binaries. It has been suggested that the highest QPO
frequencies observed in the modulation of the X-ray flux reflect a non-linear
resonance between two modes of accreting disk oscillation. This hypothesis
implies certain very general predictions, several of which have been borne out
by observations. Some of these follow from properties of non-linear
oscillators, while the others are specific to oscillations of fluid in strong
gravity. A 3:2 resonant ratio of frequencies can be clearly recognized in the
black-hole as well as in the neutron-star QPO data.",2006-03-31T11:13:58Z
"Adaptive Optics Correction of the Wavefront Distortions Induced by
  Segments Misalignment in Extremely Large Telescope","The capability of the adaptive optics to correct for the segmentation error
is analyzed in terms of the residual wavefront RMS and the power spectral
density of the phase. The analytical model and the end-to-end simulation give
qualitatively equal results justifying the significance of the geometrical
matching between segmentation geometry and the actuators/subaperture
distribution of the adaptive optics. We also show that the design of the
wavefront sensor is rather critical.",2006-06-16T11:59:50Z
NICMOS Status,"We provide an overview of the most important calibration aspects of the
NICMOS instrument on board of HST. We describe the performance of the
instrument after the installation of the NICMOS Cooling System, and show that
the behavior of the instrument has become very stable and predictable. We
detail the improvements made to the NICMOS pipeline and outline plans for
future developments. The derivation of the absolute photometric zero-point
calibration is described in detail. Finally, we describe and quantify a newly
discovered count-rate dependent non-linearity in the NICMOS cameras. This new
non-linearity is distinctly different from the total count dependent
non-linearity that is well known for near-infrared detectors. We show that the
non-linearity has a power law behavior, with pixels with high system, or vice
versa, pixels with low count rate detecting slightly less than expected. The
effect has a wavelength dependence with observations at the shortest
wavelengths being the most affected (~0.05-0.1 mag per dex flux change at ~1
micron, 0.03 mag per dex at 1.6 micron).",2006-04-19T02:56:56Z
Anisotropy of the primary cosmic-ray flux in Super-Kamiokande,"A first-ever 2-dimensional celestial map of primary cosmic-ray flux was
obtained from 2.10x10^8 cosmic-ray muons accumulated in 1662.0 days of
Super-Kamiokande. The celestial map indicates an (0.104 \pm 0.020)% excess
region in the constellation of Taurus and a -(0.094 \pm 0.014)% deficit region
toward Virgo. Interpretations of this anisotropy are discussed.",2006-05-01T06:01:11Z
Filling the Infrared Gap: ISO Observations of 1 Jy BL Lacertae Objects,"The large majority of BL Lacertae objects belonging to the 1 Jy sample, the
class prototype for radio-selected sources, are thought to emit most of their
synchrotron power in the far IR band. Ironically, this spectral region is very
sparsely sampled, with only a minority of the objects having IRAS data (most of
them being upper limits or low-quality detections). We aim at filling this IR
gap by presenting new, simultaneous ISOCAM and ISOPHOT observations over the 7
- 200 micron range for half the sample. A measurement of the position of the
synchrotron peak frequency, nu_peak, can provide information about particle
acceleration mechanisms and constrain the inverse Compton radiation that will
be detected by up-coming new gamma-ray missions. We have observed 17 1 Jy BL
Lacertae objects with the camera and the photometer on board the Infrared Space
Observatory (ISO) satellite. The ISOPHOT data reduction was done employing a
novel correction, which mitigates the effect of chopping for faint sources.
Using our new ISO data, complemented by nearly-simultaneous radio and optical
observations for 10 and 4 objects respectively, and other multi-frequency data,
we have built the spectral energy distributions of our sources (plus a
previously published one) and derived the rest-frame nu_peak. Its distribution
is centered at 10^13 Hz (30 micron) and is very narrow, with 60% of the BL Lacs
in the 1 - 3 10^13 Hz range. Given our set of simultaneous infrared data, these
represent the best determinations available of the synchrotron peak frequencies
for low-energy peaked BL Lacs. A comparison with previous such estimates, based
on non-simultaneous optical and near IR data, may indicate strong nu_peak
variations in a number of sources, possibly associated with large flares as
observed in the high-energy peaked BL Lac MKN 501. (abridged)",2006-06-09T07:07:36Z
Potential Condensed Fuel for the Milky Way,"Potential condensed clouds of gas in the Galactic halo are examined in the
context of the recent models of cooling, fragmenting clouds building up the
baryonic mass of the Galaxy. 582 high-velocity clouds (HVCs) are defined as the
potential infalling, condensed clouds and the sample's spatial and velocity
distribution are presented. With the majority of the hydrogen in the clouds
ionized (~85%), the clouds at a distribution of distances within 150 kpc, and
their individual total masses below 10^7 Msun, the total mass in potentially
condensed clouds is 1.1 - 1.4 x 10^9 Msun. If the tighter distance constraint
of < 60 kpc is adopted this mass range drops to 4.5 - 6.1 x 10^8 Msun. The
implications on the condensing cloud models, as well as feedback and additional
accretion methods, are discussed.",2006-03-23T21:01:20Z
Kinematic structure in the young Sigma Orionis association,"We have used precise radial velocity measurements for a large number of
candidate low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, to show that the young Sigma Ori
``cluster'' consists of two spatially superimposed components which are
kinematically separated by 7 km/s in radial velocity, and which have different
mean ages. We examine the relationship of these two kinematic groups to other
populations in the Orion OB1 association and briefly discuss the consequence of
mixed age samples for ongoing investigations of the formation and evolution of
low-mass objects in this much-observed region.",2006-05-24T08:42:56Z
Energy Ranking Preservation in a N-Body Cosmological Simulation,"In this paper we present a study of the cosmic flow from the point of view of
how clusterings at different dynamical regimes in an expanding universe evolve
according to a `coarse-grained' partitioning of their ranked energy
distribution. By analysing a Lambda-CDM cosmological simulation from the Virgo
Project, we find that cosmic flows evolve in an orderly sense, when tracked
from their coarse-grained energy cells, even when nonlinearities are already
developed. We show that it is possible to characterize scaling laws for the
Pairwise Velocity Distribution in terms of the energy cells, generally valid at
the linear and nonlinear clustering regimes.",2006-04-26T11:45:02Z
"VI Photometry of Globular Clusters NGC6293 and NGC6541: The Formation of
  the Metal-Poor Inner Halo Globular Clusters","We present VI photometry of the metal-poor inner halo globular clusters
NGC6293 and NGC6541 using the planetary camera of the WFPC2 on board HST. Our
color-magnitude diagrams of the clusters show well-defined BHB populations,
consistent with their low metallicities and old ages. NGC6293 appears to have
blue straggler stars in the cluster's central region. We discuss the
interstellar reddening and the distance modulus of NGC6293 and NGC6541 and
obtain E(B-V) = 0.40 and (m-M)_0 = 14.61 for NGC6293 and E(B-V) = 0.14 and
(m-M)_0 = 14.19 for NGC6541. Our results confirm that NGC6293 and NGC6541 are
clearly located in the Galaxy's central regions (R_{GC} < 3 kpc). We also
discuss the differential reddening across NGC6293. The interstellar reddening
value of NGC6293 appears to vary by Delta E(B-V) ~ 0.02 -- 0.04 mag within our
small field of view.
  The most notable result of our study is that the inner halo clusters NGC6293
and NGC6541 essentially have the same ages as M92, confirming the previous
result from the HST NIC3 observations of NGC6287.",2006-06-29T08:37:56Z
"Radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray Emission Models of the Colliding Winds
  Binary WR 140","We use hydrodynamical models of the wind-collision region (WCR) in the
archetype colliding-wind system WR140 to determine the spatial and spectral
distribution of the radio, X-ray and gamma-ray emission from shock accelerated
electrons. Our calculations are for orbital phase 0.837 when the observed radio
emission is close to maximum. Using the observed thermal X-ray emission
together with the radio emission to constrain the mass-loss rates, we find that
the O-star mass-loss rate is consistent with recent reductions for O4-5
supergiants. We demonstrate that radio VLBI observations of the WCR fail to
constrain the opening angle. The observed low frequency turnover at ~3 GHz in
the radio emission is due to free-free absorption, since models based on the
Razin effect have an unacceptably large fraction of energy in non-thermal
particles. The index of the non-thermal electron energy distribution is flatter
than the canonical value for diffusive shock acceleration, namely p<2. Several
mechanisms are discussed that could lead to such an index. Tighter constraints
on p and the nature of the shocks in WR140 will be obtained from future
observations at MeV and GeV energies, for which we generally predict lower
fluxes than previous work. Since the high stellar photon fluxes prevent the
acceleration of electrons beyond gamma > 1e5-1e6, TeV emission from CWB systems
will provide unambiguous evidence of pion-decay emission from accelerated ions.
We finish by commenting on the emission and physics of the multiple wind
collisions in dense stellar clusters, paying particular attention to the
Galactic Centre (abridged).",2006-03-29T10:52:50Z
A toy model of a fake inflation,"Discontinuities in non linear field theories propagate through null geodesics
in an effective metric that depends on its dynamics and on the background
geometry. Once information of the geometry of the universe comes mostly from
photons, one should carefully analyze the effects of possible nonlinearities on
Electrodynamics in the cosmic geometry. Such phenomenon of induced metric is
rather general and may occurs for any nonlinear theory independently of its
spin properties. We limit our analysis here to the simplest case of non linear
scalar field. We show that a class of theories that have been analyzed in the
literature, having regular configuration in the Minkowski space-time background
is such that the field propagates like free waves in an effective deSitter
geometry. The observation of these waves would led us to infer, erroneously,
that we live in a deSitter universe.",2006-04-21T19:40:45Z
Ekman layer damping of r-modes revisited,"We investigate the damping of neutron star r-modes due to the presence of a
viscous boundary (Ekman) layer at the interface between the crust and the core.
Our study is motivated by the possibility that the gravitational-wave driven
instability of the inertial r-modes may become active in rapidly spinning
neutron stars, eg. in low-mass X-ray binaries, and the fact that a viscous
Ekman layer at the core-crust interface provides an efficient damping mechanism
for these oscillations. We review various approaches to the problem and carry
out an analytic calculation of the effects due to the Ekman layer for a rigid
crust. Our analytic estimates support previous numerical results, and provide
further insight into the intricacies of the problem. We add to previous work by
discussing the effect that compressibility and composition stratification have
on the boundary layer damping. We show that, while stratification is
unimportant for the r-mode problem, composition suppresses the damping rate by
about a factor of two (depending on the detailed equation of state).",2006-07-06T11:19:02Z
Internal dynamics of the radio-halo cluster A2744,"We present a detailed dynamical analysis of the rich galaxy cluster A2744,
containing a powerful diffuse radio halo.Our analysis is based on redshift data
for 102 galaxies, part of them recovered from unexplored spectra in the ESO
archive. We combine galaxy velocity and position information to select the
cluster members and determine global dynamical properties of the cluster. We
use a variety of statistical tests to detect possible substructures. We find
that A2744 appears as a well isolated peak in the redshift space at <z>=0.306,
which includes 85 galaxies recognized as cluster members. We compute the
line-of-sight (LOS) velocity dispersion of galaxies (~1750 km/sec), which is
significantly larger than what is expected in the case of a relaxed cluster
with an observed X-ray temperature of 8 keV. We find evidence that this cluster
is far from dynamical equilibrium, as shown by the non-Gaussian nature of the
velocity distribution, the presence of a velocity gradient and a significant
substructure. In particular, our results suggest a merging scenario of two
clumps with a mass ratio of 3:1 and a LOS impact velocity (rest frame) of ~3000
km/sec, likely observed just after the core passage. The merging is occuring
roughly in the NS direction with the axis close to the LOS. This scenario
agrees with that proposed on the basis of recent Chandra results in its general
lines, although suggesting a somewhat more advanced merging phase.",2006-03-08T12:39:10Z
A catalogue of ULX coincidences with FIRST radio sources,"We search for ultra luminous X-ray source (ULXs) radio counterparts located
in nearby galaxies in order to constrain their physical nature. Our work is
based on a systematic cross-identification of the most recent and extensive
available ULX catalogues and archival radio data. A catalogue of 70 positional
coincidences is reported. Most of them are located within the galaxy nucleus.
Among them, we find 11 new cases of non-nuclear ULX sources with possibly
associated radio emission.",2006-05-22T11:14:51Z
Quark matter in compact stars?,"Ozel, in a recent reanalysis of EXO 0748-676 observational data
(astro-ph/0605106), concluded that quark matter probably does not exist in the
center of compact stars. We show that the data is actually consistent with the
presence of quark matter in compact stars.",2006-06-21T14:47:39Z
"The Araucaria Project. VLT spectra of blue supergiants in WLM:
  classification and first abundances","As part of the Araucaria Project, we present the first spectral catalog of
supergiant stars in the Local Group dwarf irregular galaxy WLM. In assigning a
spectral classification to these stars we accounted for the low metal content
of WLM relative to the galactic standards used in the MK process, by using
classification criteria developed for B and A supergiants contained in the
Small Magellanic Cloud. Our spectral catalog shows that our higher S/N
spectroscopic sample of 19 objects contains at least 6 early-B (B0-B5)
supergiants and 6 late-B and early-A (B8-A2) stars of luminosity class between
Ia and II, as well as an O7~V star and an O9.7 Ia star. The spectra of several
of these stars is of sufficiently high quality for a determination of the
stellar parameters and abundances. We have acquired also a second set of lower
S/N spectra for mostly BA stars, however their quality does not allow a further
analysis. We have carried out a quantitative analysis for three early-B
supergiants. The mean oxygen abundance we derive is 12+log(O/H)=7.83 +/- 0.12.
This value agrees very well with the measurement that is obtained from HII
regions. We therefore find no additional evidence for the discrepancy between
stellar and nebular oxygen abundances measured for a single A-type supergiant
by Venn et al. The analysis of B- and A-type supergiants yields compatible
results for nitrogen, silicon and magnesium. We show that the photometric
variability of the blue supergiants included in our spectroscopic sample is
negligible for the use of these stars as distance indicators.",2006-05-24T21:08:14Z
"A Numerical Algorithm for Modeling Multigroup Neutrino-Radiation
  Hydrodynamics in Two Spatial Dimensions","It is now generally agreed that multidimensional, multigroup, radiation
hydrodynamics is an indispensable element of any realistic model of
stellar-core collapse, core-collapse supernovae, and protoneutron star
instabilities. We have developed a new, two-dimensional, multigroup algorithm
that can model neutrino-radiation-hydrodynamic flows in core-collapse
supernovae. Our algorithm uses an approach that is similar to the ZEUS family
of algorithms, originally developed by Stone and Norman. However, we extend
that previous work in three significant ways: First, we incorporate
multispecies, multigroup, radiation hydrodynamics in a flux-limited-diffusion
approximation. Our approach is capable of modeling pair-coupled
neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics, and includes effects of Pauli blocking in the
collision integrals. Blocking gives rise to nonlinearities in the discretized
radiation-transport equations, which we evolve implicitly in time. We employ
parallelized Newton-Krylov methods to obtain a solution of these nonlinear,
implicit equations. Our second major extension to the ZEUS algorithm is
inclusion of an electron conservation equation, which describes evolution of
electron-number density in the hydrodynamic flow. This permits following the
effects of deleptonization in a stellar core. In our third extension, we have
modified the hydrodynamics algorithm to accommodate realistic, complex
equations of state, including those having non-convex behavior. In this paper,

"The XMM-Newton survey of the ELAIS-S1 field. I: Number counts, angular
  correlation function and X-ray spectral properties","We have surveyed with XMM-Newton the central ~0.6 deg2 region of the ELAIS-S1
field down to flux limits of ~5.5X10-16 cgs (0.5-2 keV, S band), ~2X10-15 cgs
(2-10 keV, H band), and ~4X10-15 cgs (5-10 keV, HH band). We detect a total of
478 sources, 395 and 205 of which detected in the S and H bands respectively.
We identified 7 clearly extended sources and estimated their redshift through
X-ray spectral fits with thermal models. In four cases the redshift is
consistent with z=0.4. We have computed the angular correlation function of the
sources in the S and H bands, finding best fit correlation angles
theta_0=5.2+/-3.8 arcsec and theta_0=12.8+/-7.8 arcsec respectively. A rough
estimate of the present-day correlation length r_0 can be obtained inverting
the Limber equation and assuming an appropriate redshift distribution dN/dz.
The results range between 12.8 and 9.8 h-1 Mpc in the S band and between 17.9
and 13.4 h-1 Mpc in the H band, with 30-40% statistical errors, assuming either
smooth redshift distributions or redshift distributions with spikes accounting
for the presence of a structure at z=0.4. The relative density of the S band
sources is higher near the clusters and groups at z~0.4 and extends toward East
and toward South/West. This suggests that the structure is complex, with a size
comparable to the full XMM-Newton field. Conversely, the highest relative
source densities of the H band sources are located in the central-west region
of the field.",2006-07-06T13:21:35Z
"OVI Asymmetry and an Accelerated Outflow in an Obscured Seyfert: FUSE
  and HST STIS Spectroscopy of Markarian533","We present far-ultraviolet spectra of the Seyfert2 galaxy Mrk533 obtained
with FUSE. These spectra show narrow asymmetrical OVI 1032,1038 emission lines
with stronger wings shortward of the peak wavelength, but the degree of
asymmetry of these wings in velocity is much lower than that of the wings of
the lines of lower ionization. In the combined OVI profile there are marginal
indications of local absorptions in the outflow. The CIII 977 line is seen
weakly with a similar profile, but with very low signal to noise. These FUV
spectra are among the first for a Seyfert of type2, i.e., a purportedly
obscured Seyfert. The HST STIS spectral image of Mrk533 allows delineation of
the various components of the outflow, and we infer that the outflow is
accelerated. We discuss the results in terms of nuclear geometry and
kinematics.",2006-03-31T05:02:01Z
The XMM-Newton view of the Crab,"We discuss the current X-ray view of the Crab Nebula and Pulsar, summarising
our analysis of observations of the source with the EPIC-pn camera on board the
XMM-Newton observatory. Different modes of EPIC-pn were combined in order to
yield a complete scenario of the spectral properties of the Crab resolved in
space and time (pulse phase). In addition we give a description of the special
EPIC-pn Burst mode and guidance for data reduction in that mode.
  We analysed spectra for the nebula and pulsar separately in the 0.6-12.0 keV
energy band. All data were processed with the SAS 6.0.0 XMM-Newton Scientific
Analysis System package; models were fitted to the data with XSPEC 11. The high
time resolution of EPIC-pn in its Burst mode (7 micros) was used for a phase
resolved analysis of the pulsar spectrum, after determination of the period
with epoch folding techniques. Data from the Small Window mode were processed
and corrected for pile-up allowing for spectroscopy simultaneously resolved in
space and time.
  The spatial variation of the spectrum over the entire region of the Crab
shows a gradual spectral softening from the inner pulsar region to the outer
nebula region with a variation in photon index, Gamma, from 2.0 to 2.4. Pulse
phase resolved spectroscopy of the Crab Pulsar reveals a phase dependent
modulation of the photon index in form of a significant hardening of the
spectrum in the inter-peak phase from Gamma =1.7 during the pulse peak to Gamma
=1.5.",2006-04-05T12:28:26Z
"High Redshift Intergalactic C IV Abundance Measurements from the
  Near-Infrared Spectra of Two z~6 QSOs","New measurements of the z~6 intergalactic CIV abundance are presented, using
moderate resolution IR spectra of two QSOs taken with GNIRS on Gemini South.
These data were systematically searched for high redshift CIV absorption lines,
using objective selection criteria. Comprehensive tests were performed to
quantify sample incompleteness, as well as the rate of false positive CIV
identifications. The trend of constant $\Omega_{CIV}(z)$ observed at z~2-5
appears to continue to z~6, the highest observed redshift. The CIV sample is
also consistent with the redshift-invariant form of the CIV column density
distribution reported by Songaila (2001) at lower redshift, although with
fairly large uncertainties due to a smaller sample size and noisier infrared
data. The constant value of $\Omega_{CIV}$ does not necessarily imply that the
IGM was infused with an early metallicity ``floor,'' but the presence of early
CIV does indicate that heavy-element enrichment began < 1 Gyr after the Big
Bang. The lack of a decline in $\Omega_{CIV}$ at high redshift may indicate
that integrated CIV measurements are sensitive to the instantaneous rate of
feedback from galaxy formation at each epoch. Alternatively, it could result
from a balance in the evolution of the intergalactic gas density, ionization
conditions, and heavy-element abundance over time.",2006-05-30T16:31:22Z
"The X-ray spectrum of the bursting atoll source 4U~1728-34 observed with
  INTEGRAL","We present for the first time a study of the 3-200 keV broad band spectra of
the bursting atoll source 4U 1728-34 (GX 354-0) along its hardness intensity
diagram. The analysis was done using the INTEGRAL public and Galactic Center
deep exposure data ranging from February 2003 to October 2004. The spectra are
well described by a thermal Comptonization model with an electron temperature
from 35 keV to 3 keV and Thomson optical depth, tau_T, from 0.5 to 5 in a slab
geometry. The source undergoes a transition from an intermediate/hard to a soft
state where the source luminosity increases from 2 to 12% of Eddington. We have
also detected 36 type I X-ray bursts two of which show photospheric radius
expansion. The energetic bursts with photospheric radius expansion occurred at
an inferred low mass accretion rate per unit area of \dot m ~ 1.7x10E3 g/cm2/s,
while the others at a higher one between 2.4x10E3 - 9.4x10E3 g/cm2/s. For
4U1728-34 the bursts' total fluence, and the bursts' peak flux are
anti-correlated with the mass accretion rate. The type I X-ray bursts involve
pure helium burning either during the hard state, or during the soft state of
the source.",2006-07-14T10:50:26Z
The Ultraluminous X-ray Source in Holmberg IX and its Environment,"We present optical observations of an ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) in
Holmberg IX, a dwarf galaxy near M81. The ULX has an average X-ray luminosity
of some 10^{40} erg/s. It is located in a huge (400pc x 300pc) ionized nebula
being much larger than normal supernova remnants. From the observed emission
lines (widths and ratios) we find that the structure is due to collisional
excitation by shocks, rather than by photoionization.
  We identify the optical counterpart to be a 22.8 mag blue star (M_V=-5.0)
belonging to a small stellar cluster. From isochrone fitting of our
multi-colour photometry we determine a cluster age of 20 to 50 Myr. We also
discovered strong stellar HeII4686 emission (equivalent width of 10 A) which
proves the identification with the X-ray source, and which suggests the
presence of an X-ray heated accretion disc around the putative black hole.",2006-03-28T16:44:17Z
"Simple Magnetic Flux Balance as an Indicator of Neon VIII Doppler
  Velocity Partitioning in an Equatorial Coronal Hole","We present a novel investigation into the relationship between simple
estimates of magnetic flux balance and the Ne VIII Doppler velocity
partitioning of a large equatorial coronal hole observed by the Solar
Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation spectrometer (SUMER) on the Solar
and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) in November 1999. We demonstrate that a
considerable fraction of the large scale Doppler velocity pattern in the
coronal hole can be qualitatively described by simple measures of the local
magnetic field conditions, i.e., the relative unbalance of magnetic polarities
and the radial distance required to balance local flux concentrations with
those of opposite polarity.",2006-05-22T15:35:07Z
"Filaments, Bubbles, and Weak Shocks in the Gaseous Atmosphere of M87","We present the first results from a 500 ksec Chandra ACIS-I observation of
M87. At soft energies (0.5-1.0 keV), we detect filamentary structures
associated with the eastern and southwestern X-ray and radio arms. Many
filaments are spatially resolved with widths of ~300 pc. This filamentary
structure is particularly striking in the eastern arm where we suggest the
filaments are outer edges of a series of plasma-filled, buoyant bubbles whose
ages differ by ~6 x 10^6 years. These X-ray structures may be influenced by
magnetic filamentation. At hard energies (3.5-7.5 keV), we detect a nearly
circular ring of outer radius 2.8' (13 kpc) which provides an unambiguous
signature of a weak shock, driven by an outburst from the SMBH. The density
rise in the shock is ~1.3 (Mach number, M~1.2). The observed spectral hardening
in the ring corresponds to a temperature rise T_shock / T_0 ~ 1.2, or M~1.2, in
agreement with the Mach number derived independently from the gas density.
Thus, for the first time, we detect gas temperature and density jumps
associated with a classical shock in the atmosphere around a supermassive black
hole. We also detect two additional surface brightness edges and pressure
enhancements at radii of ~0.6' and ~1'. The ~0.6' feature may be
over-pressurized thermal gas surrounding the relativistic plasma in the radio
cocoon, the ``piston'', produced by the current episode of AGN activity. The
over-pressurized gas is surrounded by a cool gas shell. The ~1' feature may be
an additional weak shock from a secondary outburst. In an earlier episode, the
``piston'' was responsible for driving the 2.8' shock.",2006-04-27T20:35:41Z
A note on cosmological parameters and the topology of the universe,"Given the wealth of increasingly accurate cosmological observations,
especially the recent results from the WMAP, and the development of methods and
strategies in the search for cosmic topology, it is reasonable to expect that
we should be able to detect the spatial topology of the Universe in the near
future. Motivated by this, we examine to what extent a possible detection of a
nontrivial topology of positively curved universe may be used to place
constraints on the matter content of the Universe. We show through concrete
examples that the knowledge of the spatial topology allows to place constraints
on the density parameters associated to dark matter ($\Omega_m$) and dark
energy ($\Omega_{\Lambda}$)",2006-04-05T00:54:14Z
The Turbulent Interstellar Medium,"An overview is presented of the main properties of the interstellar medium.
Evidence is summarized that the interstellar medium is highly turbulent, driven
on different length scales by various energetic processes. Large-scale
turbulence determines the formation of structures like filaments and shells in
the diffuse interstellar medium. It also regulates the formation of dense, cold
molecular clouds. Molecular clouds are now believed to be transient objects
that form on timescales of order 1e7 yrs in regions where HI gas is compressed
and cools. Supersonic turbulence in the compressed HI slab is generated by a
combination of hydrodynamical instabilities, coupled with cooling. Turbulent
dissipation is compensated by the kinetic energy input of the inflow. Molecular
hydrogen eventually forms when the surface density in the slab reaches a
threshold value of 1e21 cm^-2 at which point further cooling triggers the onset
of star formation by gravitational collapse. A few Myrs later, the newly formed
stars and resulting supernovae will disperse their molecular surrounding and
generate new expanding shells that drive again turbulence in the diffuse gas
and trigger the formation of a next generation of cold clouds. Although a
consistent scenario of interstellar medium dynamics and star formation is
emerging many details are still unclear and require more detailed work on
microphysical processes as well as a better understanding of supersonic,
compressible turbulence.",2006-05-03T11:42:02Z
"The multi-frequency angular power spectrum of the epoch of reionization
  21 cm signal","Observations of redshifted 21cm radiation from HI at high redshifts is an
important future probe of reionization. We consider the Multi-frequency Angular
Power Spectrum (MAPS) to quantify the statistics of the HI signal as a joint
function of the angular multipole l and frequency separation \Delta\nu. The
signal at two different frequencies is expected to get decorrelated as
\Delta\nu is increased, and quantifying this decorrelation is particularly
important in deciding the frequency resolution for future HI observations. This
is also expected to play a very crucial role in extracting the signal from
foregrounds as the signal is expected to decorrelate much faster than the
foregrounds (which are largely continuum sources) with increasing \Delta\nu. In
this paper we develop formulae relating the MAPS to different components of the
three dimensional HI power spectrum taking into account HI peculiar velocities.
We show that the flat-sky approximation provides a very good representation
over the angular scales of interest, and a final expression which is very
simple to calculate and interpret. We present results considering two models
for the HI distribution, namely, (i) DM: where the HI traces the dark matter
and (ii) PR: where the effects of patchy reionization are incorporated through
two parameters. We find that while the DM signal is largely featureless, the PR
signal peaks at the angular scales of the individual bubbles, and the signal is
considerably enhanced for large bubble size. For most cases of interest at l
\sim 100 the signal is uncorrelated beyond \Delta\nu \sim 1 MHz or even less,
whereas it occurs around \sim 0.1 MHz at l \sim 10^3. The \Delta\nu dependence
also carries an imprint of the bubble size and the bias, and is expected to be
an important probe of the reionization scenario (abridged).",2006-05-22T05:36:07Z
Low-mass star formation in Lynds 1333,"Medium-resolution optical spectroscopy of the candidate YSOs associated with
the small, nearby molecular cloud Lynds~1333 revealed four previously unknown
classical T Tauri stars, two of which are components of a visual double, and a
Class I source, IRAS 02086+7600. The spectroscopic data, together with new V,R_
C,I_C photometric and 2MASS J, H, and K_s data allowed us to estimate the
masses and ages of the new T Tauri stars. We touch on the possible scenario of
star formation in the region. L1333 is one of the smallest and nearest known
star forming clouds, therefore it may be a suitable target for studying in
detail the small scale structure of a star forming environment.",2006-06-20T07:44:41Z
"Elastic or magnetic? A toy model for global magnetar oscillations with
  implications for QPOs during flares","We use a simple toy-model to discuss global MHD modes of a neutron star,
taking into account the magnetic coupling between the elastic crust and the
fluid core. Our results suggest that the notion of pure torsional crust modes
is not useful for the coupled system, all modes excite Alfven waves in the
core. However, we also show that the modes that are most likely to be excited
by a fractured crust, eg. during a magnetar flare, are such that the crust and
the core oscillate in concert. For our simple model, the frequencies of these
modes are similar to the ``pure crustal'' frequencies. In addition, our model
provides a natural explanation for the presence of lower frequency ($< 30$~Hz)

"First results of the Instrumentation Line for the deep-sea ANTARES
  neutrino telescope","In 2005, the ANTARES Collaboration deployed and operated at a depth of 2500 m
a so-called Mini Instrumentation Line equipped with Optical Modules (MILOM) at
the ANTARES site. The various data acquired during the continuous operation
from April to December 2005 of the MILOM confirm the satisfactory performance
of the Optical Modules, their front-end electronics and readout system, as well
as the calibration devices of the detector. The in-situ measurement of the
Optical Module time response yields a resolution better than 0.5 ns. The
performance of the acoustic positioning system, which enables the spatial
reconstruction of the ANTARES detector with a precision of about 10 cm, is
verified. These results demonstrate that with the full ANTARES neutrino
telescope the design angular resolution of better than $0.3^\circ$ can be
realistically achieved.",2006-06-09T13:27:12Z

"GMASS, Unveiling Distant Massive Galaxies with Spitzer","One of the main questions of galaxy formation is how and when galaxies
assembled their mass. Observations suggest that most mass assembly and star
formation occured at 1 < z < 3. However, in the same redshift range, fully
assembled old and massive galaxies co-exist with star-bursting systems still in
their assembling stage. In order to explore galaxy evolution in this critical
redshift range, we started a project called GMASS (Galaxy Mass Assembly
ultra-deep Spectroscopic Survey) based on an 145 hours ESO Large Program and
aimed at doing ultradeep spectroscopy with the VLT of a sample of high redshift
galaxies slected with IRAC/Spitzer m(4.5mu) < 23, z(phot) > 1.4) from the
GOODS-South/HUDF region. The selection at 4.5 micron is crucial to select high
redshift galaxies based on the stellar mass or objects affected by strong dust
extinction. The spectroscopic deep integration times (15 - 50 hours) are needed
to identify unambiguously the redshift and nature of these galaxies, which
redshifts are mostly in the ""desert"" where spectroscopy is traditionally
difficult due to the absence of strong emission lines at optical wavelengths.
The survey is almost complete and some preliminary results are presented here.",2006-04-06T14:01:07Z
"The Kinematic and Plasma Properties of X-ray Knots in Cassiopeia A from
  the Chandra HETGS","We present high-resolution X-ray spectra from the young supernova remnant Cas
A using a 70-ks observation taken by the Chandra High Energy Transmission
Grating Spectrometer (HETGS). Line emission, dominated by Si and S ions, is
used for high-resolution spectral analysis of many bright, narrow regions of
Cas A to examine their kinematics and plasma state. These data allow a 3D
reconstruction using the unprecedented X-ray kinematic results: we derive
unambiguous Doppler shifts for these selected regions, with values ranging
between -2500 and +4000 km/s. Plasma diagnostics of these regions, derived from
line ratios of resolved He-like triplet lines and H-like lines of Si, indicate
temperatures largely around 1 keV, which we model as O-rich reverse-shocked
ejecta. The ionization age also does not vary considerably over these regions
of the remnant. The gratings analysis was complemented by the non-dispersed
spectra from the same dataset, which provided information on emission measure
and elemental abundances for the selected Cas A regions. The derived electron
density of X-ray emitting ejecta varies from 20 to 200 cm^{-3}. The measured
abundances of Mg, Si, S and Ca are consistent with O being the dominant element
in the Cas A plasma. With a diameter of 5 arcmin, Cas A is the largest source
observed with the HETGS to date. We, therefore, describe the technique we use
and some of the challenges we face in the HETGS data reduction from such an
extended, complex object.",2006-05-03T01:47:07Z
"CADIS has seen the Virgo overdensity and parts of the Monoceros and
  `Orphan' streams in retrospect","We reanalyze deep star counts in five CADIS fields. The data are presented as
vertical density distributions of stars perpendicular to the Galactic plane. In
three fields the profiles are consistent with each other, while in two fields
significant overdensities of stars are found. The overdensity in one field can
be associated with the Virgo overdensity which can be traced right into the
disk of the Milky Way. Using this detection we estimate the mass of the Virgo
overdensity and show that this is equivalent to the stellar content of a Local
Group dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The overdensity in the second field is more
difficult to associate with a previously known overdensity. We suggest that it
is related both to the Monoceros stream and the recently discovered Orphan
stream.",2006-07-19T15:27:35Z
"Dark energy and curvature from a future baryonic acoustic oscillation
  survey using the Lyman-alpha forest","We explore the requirements for a Lyman-alpha forest (LyaF) survey designed
to measure the angular diameter distance and Hubble parameter at 2~<z~<4 using
the standard ruler provided by baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO). The goal
would be to obtain a high enough density of sources to probe the
three-dimensional density field on the scale of the BAO feature. A
percent-level measurement in this redshift range can almost double the Dark
Energy Task Force Figure of Merit, relative to the case with only a similar
precision measurement at z~1, if the Universe is not assumed to be flat. This
improvement is greater than the one obtained by doubling the size of the z~1
survey, with Planck and a weak SDSS-like z=0.3 BAO measurement assumed in each
case. Galaxy BAO surveys at z~1 may be able to make an effective LyaF
measurement simultaneously at minimal added cost, because the required number
density of quasars is relatively small. We discuss the constraining power as a
function of area, magnitude limit (density of quasars), resolution, and
signal-to-noise of the spectra. For example, a survey covering 2000 sq. deg.
and achieving S/N=1.8 per Ang. at g=23 (~40 quasars per sq. deg.) with an
R~>250 spectrograph is sufficient to measure both the radial and transverse
oscillation scales to 1.4% from the LyaF (or better, if fainter magnitudes and
possibly Lyman-break galaxies can be used). At fixed integration time and in
the sky-noise-dominated limit, a wider, noisier survey is generally more
efficient; the only fundamental upper limit on noise being the need to identify
a quasar and find a redshift. Because the LyaF is much closer to linear and
generally better understood than galaxies, systematic errors are even less
likely to be a problem.",2006-07-07T01:08:50Z
The influence of gas on the structure of merger remnants,"We present a large set of merger simulations of early-type disc galaxies with
mass ratios of 1:1 and 3:1 and 10% of the total disc mass in gas. In contrast
to the collisionless case equal-mass mergers with gas do not result in very
boxy remnants which is caused by the suppression of box orbits and the change
of the projected shape of minor-axis tube orbits in the more axisymmetric
remnants. The isophotal shape of 3:1 remnants and the global kinematic
properties of 1:1 and 3:1 remnants are only weakly affected by the presence of
gas. 1:1 remnants are slowly rotating whereas 3:1 remnants are fast rotating
and discy. The shape of the stellar LOSVD is strongly influenced by gas. The
LOSVDs of collisionless remnants have broad leading wings while their gaseous
counterparts show steep leading wings, more consistent with observations of
elliptical galaxies. We show that this change is also caused by the suppressed
populating of box orbits and it is amplified by the formation of extended gas
discs in the merger remnants. If elliptical galaxies have formed from mergers
our results indicate that massive, slowly rotating boxy elliptical galaxies can
not have formed from dissipative mergers of discs. Pure stellar (dry) mergers
are the more likely candidates. On the other hand lower mass, fast rotating and
discy ellipticals can have formed from dissipative (wet) mergers of early-type
discs. So far, only unequal-mass disc mergers with gas can successfully explain
their observed substructure. This is consistent with the revised morphological
classification scheme of increasing importance of gas dissipation when moving
from boxy ellipticals to discy ellipticals and then to spiral galaxies,
proposed by Kormendy & Bender (abbreviated).",2006-05-05T10:49:20Z
The Connection Between Barstrength and Circumnuclear Dust Structure,"We present a comparison of barstrength Qb and circumnuclear dust morphology
for 75 galaxies in order to investigate how bars affect the centers of
galaxies. We trace the circumnuclear dust morphology and amount of dust
structure with structure maps generated from visible-wavelength HST data,
finding that tightly wound nuclear dust spirals are primarily found in weakly
barred galaxies. While strongly barred galaxies sometimes exhibit grand design
structure within the central 10 percent of D25, this structure rarely extends
to within ~10 pc of the galaxy nucleus. In some galaxies, these spiral arms
terminate at a circumnuclear starburst ring. Galaxies with circumnuclear rings
are generally more strongly barred than galaxies lacking rings. Within these
rings, the dust structure is fairly smooth and usually in the form of a loosely
wound spiral. These data demonstrate that multiple nuclear morphologies are
possible in the most strongly barred galaxies: chaotic central dust structure
inconsistent with a coherent nuclear spiral, a grand design spiral that loses
coherence before reaching the nucleus, or a grand design spiral that ends in a
circumnuclear ring. These observations may indicate that not all strong bars
are equally efficient at fueling material to the centers of their host
galaxies. Finally, we investigate the longstanding hypothesis that SB(s)
galaxies have weak bars and SB(r) galaxies have strong bars, finding the
opposite to be the case: namely, SB(r) galaxies are less strongly barred and
have less dust structure than SB(s) galaxies. In general, more strongly barred
galaxies tend to have higher nuclear dust contrast.",2006-06-19T20:30:22Z
Pulsational Instabilities in Accreting White Dwarfs,"(Abridged) The Cataclysmic Variable (CV) population harbors a diverse range
of donor stars and accreting white dwarfs (WDs). A range of WD masses is
expected, from low mass Helium core WDs, to massive WDs which have previously
accreted at rates high enough for Hydrogen to burn steadily. Furthermore, a
wide range of Helium enrichment is expected in the accreted material depending
on the degree to which the donor star is evolved. We investigate the impact of
this diversity on the range of effective temperatures ($T_{\rm eff}$) for which
g-modes are unstable. The critical $T_{\rm eff}$ below which modes are unstable
(""blue edge"") depends on both surface gravity, $g$, and He abundance, $Y$. The
Hydrogen/first Helium ionization instability strip is more sensitive to $g$
than $Y$. We find that (for solar composition envelopes), relative to a
fiducial WD mass $0.6 M_\odot$, the blue edge for a $0.4 M_\odot$ He core WD
shifts downward by $\approx 1000 {\rm K}$, while that for a massive $\approx
1.2 M_\odot$ WD shifts upward by $\approx 2000 {\rm K}$. The second Helium
ionization instability strip exhibits strong dependences on both $g$ and $Y$.
Surprisingly, increasing $Y$ by only 10% relative to solar creates an
instability strip near $15,000 {\rm K}$. Hence CV's below the period gap with
evolved donor stars of $Y\ga 0.4$ may have an ""intermediate"" instability strip
well outside of the isolated DA and DB variables. This ""intermediate""
instability strip also occurs for low mass He WD with solar composition
envelopes. The lack of pulsations in CV's with $T_{\rm eff}$ in the pure
Hydrogen ZZ Ceti instability strip is also easily explained.",2006-04-13T20:49:59Z
MHD disc winds,"This is a doctorate level lecture on the physics of accretion discs driving
magnetically self-confined jets, usually referred to in the literature as disc
winds. I will first review the governing magnetohydrodynamic equations and then
discuss their physical content. At that level, necessary conditions to drive
jets from keplerian accretion discs can already be derived. These conditions
are validated with self-similar calculations of accretion-ejection structures.
In a second part, I will critically discuss the biases introduced when using
self-similarity as well as some other questions such as: Are these systems
really unstable? Can a standard accretion disc provide the conditions to launch
jets in its innermost parts? What is the difference between X-winds and
disc-winds? Finally, the magnetic interaction between a protostar and its
circumstellar disc will be discussed with a focus on stellar spin down.",2006-07-11T08:28:39Z
Long RXTE Observations of A2163,"A2163 was observed by the RXTE satellite for 530 ks during a 6 month period
starting in August 2004. The cluster primary emission is from very hot
intracluster gas with kT~15 keV, but this component does not by itself provide
the best fitting model. A secondary emission component is quite clearly needed,
and while this could also be thermal at a temperature significantly lower than
kT~15 keV, the best fit (to the combined PCA and HEXTE datasets) is obtained
with a power law secondary spectral component. The deduced parameters of the
non-thermal (NT) emission imply a significant fractional flux amounting to ~25%
of the integrated 3-50 keV emission. NT emission is expected given the intense
level of radio emission, most prominently from a large extended (`halo')
central region of the cluster. Interpreting the deduced NT emission as Compton
scattering of the radio-emitting relativistic electrons by the CMB, we estimate
the volume-averaged value of the magnetic field in the extended radio region to
be B=0.4+/-0.2 microG.",2006-06-05T20:56:25Z
"Scientific Results from High-precision Astrometry at the Palomar Testbed
  Interferometer","A new observing mode for the Palomar Testbed Interferometer was developed
in2002-2003 which enables differential astrometry at the level of 20
micro-arcseconds for binary systems with separations of several hundred
milli-arcseconds (mas). This phase-referenced mode is the basis of the Palomar
High-precision Astrometric Search for Exoplanet Systems (PHASES), a search for
giant planets orbiting either the primary or secondary star in fifty binary
systems. We present the first science results from the PHASES search. The
properties of the stars comprising binary systems are determined to high
precision. The mutual inclinations of several hierarchical triple star systems
have been determined. We will present upper limits constraining the the
existence of giant planets in a few of the target systems.",2006-05-31T01:37:53Z
Extremely Red Objects in Two Quasar Fields at z ~ 1.5,"We present an investigation of the properties and environments of bright
extremely red objects (EROs) found in the fields of the quasars TXS 0145+386
and 4C 15.55, both at z ~ 1.4. There is marginal evidence from Chandra ACIS
imaging for hot cluster gas with a luminosity of a few 10^44 ergs/s in the
field of 4C 15.55. The TXS 0145+386 field has an upper limit at a similar
value, but it also clearly shows an overdensity of faint galaxies. None of the
EROs are detected as X-ray sources. For two of the EROs that have
spectral-energy distributions and rest-frame near-UV spectra that show that
they are strongly dominated by old stellar populations, we determine
radial-surface-brightness profiles from adaptive-optics images. Both of these
galaxies are best fit by profiles close to exponentials, plus a compact nucleus
comprising ~30% of the total light in one case and 8% in the other. Neither is
well fit by an r^1/4-law profile. This apparent evidence for the formation of
massive ~2 X 10^11 disks of old stars in the early universe indicates that at
least some galaxies formed essentially monolithically, with high star-formation
rates sustained over a few 10^8 years, and without the aid of major mergers.",2006-08-04T08:38:01Z
Direct X-ray Constraints on Sterile Neutrino Warm Dark Matter,"Warm dark matter (WDM) might more easily account for small scale clustering
measurements than the heavier particles typically invoked in Lambda cold dark
matter (LCDM) cosmologies. In this paper, we consider a Lambda WDM cosmology in
which sterile neutrinos nu_s, with a mass m_s of roughly 1-100 keV, are the
dark matter. We use the diffuse X-ray spectrum (total minus resolved point
source emission) of the Andromeda galaxy to constrain the rate of sterile
neutrino radiative decay: nu_s -> nu_{e,mu,tau} + gamma. Our findings demand
that m_s < 3.5 keV (95% C.L.) which is a significant improvement over the
previous (95% C.L.) limits inferred from the X-ray emission of nearby clusters,
m_s < 8.2 keV (Virgo A) and m_s < 6.3 keV (Virgo A + Coma).",2006-05-17T19:00:52Z
Generalized Galilei-Invariant Classical Mechanics,"To describe the ``slow'' motions of n interacting mass points, we give the
most general 4-d non-instantaneous, non-particle symmetric Galilei-invariant
variational principle. It involves two-body invariants constructed from
particle 4-positions and 4-velocities of the proper orthochronous inhomogeneous
Galilei group. The resulting 4-d equations of motion and multiple-time
conserved quantities involve integrals over the world lines of the other n-1
interacting particles. For a particular time-asymmetric retarded (advanced)
interaction, we show the vanishing of all integrals over world-lines in the ten
standard 4-d multiple-time conserved quantities, thus yielding a Newtonian-like
initial value problem. This interaction gives 3-d non-instantaneous,
non-particle symmetric, coupled non-linear second-order delay-differential
equations of motion that involve only algebraic combinations of
non-simultaneous particle positions, velocities, and accelerations. The ten 3-d
non-instantaneous, non-particle symmetric conserved quantities involve only
algebraic combinations of non-simultaneous particle positions and velocities. A
two-body example with a generalized Newtonian gravity is provided. We suggest
that this formalism might be useful as an alternative slow-motion mechanics for
astrophysical applications.",2006-05-05T19:14:25Z
"Breaking Cosmological Degeneracies in Galaxy Cluster Surveys with a
  Physical Model of Cluster Structure","Forthcoming large galaxy cluster surveys will yield tight constraints on
cosmological models. It has been shown that in an idealized survey, containing
> 10,000 clusters, statistical errors on dark energy and other cosmological
parameters will be at the percent level. It has also been shown that through
""self-calibration"", parameters describing the mass-observable relation and
cosmology can be simultaneously determined, though at a loss in accuracy by
about an order of magnitude. Here we examine the utility of an alternative
approach of self-calibration, in which a parametrized ab-initio physical model
is used to compute cluster structure and the resulting mass-observable
relations. As an example, we use a modified-entropy (""pre-heating"") model of
the intracluster medium, with the history and magnitude of entropy injection as
unknown input parameters. Using a Fisher matrix approach, we evaluate the
expected simultaneous statistical errors on cosmological and cluster model
parameters. We study two types of surveys, in which a comparable number of
clusters are identified either through their X-ray emission or through their
integrated Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. We find that compared to a
phenomenological parametrization of the mass-observable relation, using our
physical model yields significantly tighter constraints in both surveys, and
offers substantially improved synergy when the two surveys are combined. These
results suggest that parametrized physical models of cluster structure will be
useful when extracting cosmological constraints from SZ and X-ray cluster
surveys. (abridged)",2006-05-08T20:07:25Z
Stellar Populations with ELTs,"The star formation, mass assembly and chemical enrichment histories of
galaxies, and their present distributions of dark matter, remain encoded in
their stellar populations. Distinguishing the actual distribution functions of
stellar age, metallicity and kinematics at several locations in a range of
galaxies, sampling across Hubble types and representative environments, is the
information required for a robust description of galaxy histories. Achieving
this requires large aperture, to provide the sensitivity to reach a range of
environs and Hubble types beyond the Local Group, to provide high spatial
resolution, since the fields are crowded, and preferably with optical
performance since age-sensitivity is greatest near the main-sequence turn-off,
and metallicity-sensitivity for these warm stars is greatest in the optical.",2006-04-06T11:45:25Z
"Limits on Defects Formation and Hybrid Inflationary Models with
  Three-Year WMAP Observations","We confront the predicted effects of hybrid inflationary models on the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) with three years of Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
Probe (WMAP) observations. Using model selection, we compare the ability of a
simple flat power-law LCDM model to describe the data to that of hybrid
inflationary models involving global or local cosmic strings, or global
textures. We find that it is statistically impossible to distinguish between
these models: they all give a similar description of the data, the maximum
ratio of the various Bayesian evidences involved being never higher than e^{0.1
\pm 0.5}. We then derive the maximum contribution that topological defects can
make to the CMB, and place an upper bound on the possible value of cosmic
strings' tension of G\mu \leq 2.1 \times 10^{-7} (68% confidence limit).
Finally, we give the corresponding constraints on the D-term strings' mass
scale, as well as limits on the F- and D-term coupling constants (\kappa and
\lambda) and inflationary scales (M and \sqrt{\xi}).",2006-03-22T20:38:09Z
On the formation of H-alpha line emission around classical T Tauri stars,"We present radiative transfer models of the circumstellar environment of
classical T Tauri stars, concentrating on the formation of the H-alpha
emission. The wide variety of line profiles seen in observations are indicative
of both inflow and outflow, and we therefore employ a circumstellar structure
that includes both magnetospheric accretion and a disc wind. We perform
systematic investigations of the model parameters for the wind and the
magnetosphere to search for possible geometrical and physical conditions which
lead to the types of profiles seen in observations. We find that the hybrid
models can reproduce the wide range of profile types seen in observations, and
that the most common profile types observed occupy a large volume of parameter
space. Conversely, the most infrequently observed profile morphologies require
a very specific set of models parameters. We find our model profiles are
consistent with the canonical value of the mass-loss rate to mass-accretion
rate ratio (mu=0.1) found in earlier magneto-hydrodynamic calculations and
observations, but the models with 0.05<mu<0.2 are still in accord with observed
H-alpha profiles. We investigate the wind contribution to the line profile as a
function of model parameters, and examine the reliability of H-alpha as a mass
accretion diagnostic. Finally, we examine the H-alpha spectroscopic
classification used by Reipurth et. al, and discuss the basic physical
conditions that are required to reproduce the profiles in each classified type.",2006-05-09T14:11:36Z
"Masses of Astrometrically-Discovered and Imaged Binaries: G 78-28AB and
  GJ 231.1BC","The Stellar Planet Survey (STEPS) is an ongoing astrometric search for giant
planets and brown dwarfs around a sample of ~30 M-dwarfs. We have discovered
several low-mass companions by measuring the motion of our target stars
relative to their reference frames. The highest mass discovery thus far is G
78-28B, a companion to the M-dwarf G 78-28A. The orbital period is 4.18 +/-
0.03 y, the system mass is 0.565 +/- 0.055 Msolar, and the semi-major axis is
2.19 +/- 0.10 AU. Imaging observations with the Keck laser guide star adaptive
optics (LGSAO) and the Palomar AO instruments resolved the system and also
yielded JHK-band delta magnitudes. We use the orbital solution, light ratios,
and mass-luminosity relationships to derive component masses of MA = 0.370 +/-
0.034 Msolar and MB = 0.195 +/- 0.021 Msolar. G 78-28B is of type M4 V based
upon its colors and mass. We also discovered GJ 231.1C, a companion to GJ
231.1B, with STEPS and imaged the companion with LGSAO and Palomar AO, but the
orbital period is longer than our observing baseline; thus the system
parameters are less constrained. In GJ 231.1BC the masses are MB = 0.25 +/-
0.06 Msolar and MC =0.12 +/- 0.02 Msolar. The inferred spectral type of GJ
231.1C is M5 V. We demonstrate the results of the current state of mass
estimation techniques with our data.",2006-05-11T22:03:50Z
The Recurrent Eclipse of an Unusual Pre--Main-Sequence Star in IC 348,"The recurrence of a previously documented eclipse of a solar-like
pre--main-sequence star in the young cluster IC 348 has been observed. The
recurrence interval is 4.7 $\pm 0.1$ yr and portions of 4 cycles have now been
seen. The duration of each eclipse is at least 3.5 years, or $\sim 75$% of a
cycle, verifying that this is not an eclipse by a stellar companion. The light
curve is generally symmetric and approximately flat-bottomed. Brightness at
maximum and minimum have been rather stable over the years but the light curve
is not perfectly repetitive or smooth and small variations exist at all phases.
We confirm that the star is redder when fainter. Models are discussed and it is
proposed that this could be a system similar to KH 15D in NGC 2264.
Specifically, it may be an eccentric binary in which a portion of the orbit of
one member is currently occulted during some binary phases by a circumbinary
disk. The star deserves sustained observational attention for what it may
reveal about the circumstellar environment of low-mass stars of planet-forming
age.",2006-06-20T23:26:16Z
{Millimeter Multiplicity in NGC 6334 I and I(N),"Using the Submillimeter Array (SMA), we have imaged the 1.3 millimeter
continuum emission at the center of the massive star-forming regions NGC 6334 I
and I(N). In both regions, the SMA observations resolve the emission into
multiple millimeter sources, with most of the sources clustered into areas only
10,000 AU in diameter. Toward NGC 6334 I, we find four compact sources: the two
brightest (I-SMA1 and I-SMA2) are associated with previously-known ammonia
cores; I-SMA3 is coincident with the peak of the compact HII region (NGC 6334
F); and I-SMA4 is a newly-discovered object. While I-SMA3 exhibits a mixture of
free-free and dust emission, the rest of the objects are dust cores. Toward NGC
6334 I(N), seven compact dust cores are found, one of which is associated with
a faint centimeter source. With the exception of I-SMA3, none of the millimeter
sources have infrared counterparts in Spitzer Space Telescope 3-8 micron
images. Using a simple physical model for the dust continuum emission, the
estimated mass of interstellar material toward each of these compact objects is
in the range of 3 to 66 solar masses. The total mass in the compact objects
appears to be similar in I and I(N). The small size of these groups of sources
suggest that these objects are proto-Trapezia forming in the centers of
clusters of low to intermediate-mass stars.",2006-05-18T19:51:25Z
The University of Hawaii Wide Field Imager (UHWFI),"The University of Hawaii Wide-Field Imager (UHWFI) is a focal compressor
system designed to project the full half-degree field of the UH 2.2 m telescope
onto the refurbished UH 8Kx8K CCD camera. The optics use Ohara glasses and are
mounted in an oil-filled cell to minimize light losses and ghost images from
the large number of internal lens surfaces. The UHWFI is equipped with a
six-position filter wheel and a rotating sector blade shutter,both driven by
stepper motors. The instrument saw first light in 2004 in an engineering mode.
After filling the lens cell with index matching oil, integration of all
software components into the user interface, tuning of the CCD performance, and
the purchase of the final filter set, UHWFI is now fully commissioned at the UH
2.2 m telescope.",2006-04-01T03:15:25Z
Dark energy constraints from lensing-detected galaxy clusters,"We study the ability of weak lensing surveys to detect galaxy clusters and
constrain cosmological parameters, in particular the equation of state of dark
energy. There are two major sources of noise for weak lensing cluster
measurements: the ``shape noise'' from the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies;
and the large scale projection noise. We produce a filter for the shear field
which optimizes the signal-to-noise of shape-noise-dominated shear
measurements. Our Fisher-matrix analysis of this projected-mass observable
makes use of the shape of this mass function, and takes into account the
Poisson variance, sample variance, shape noise, and projected-mass noise, and
also the fact that the conversion of the shear signal into mass is
cosmology-dependent. The Fisher analysis is applied to both a nominal 15,000
square degree ground-based survey and a 1000 square degree space-based survey.
Assuming a detection threshold of S/N=5, we find both experiments detect
\~20,000 clusters, and yield 1-sigma constraints of ~0.07 for w0 and ~0.2 for
wa when combined with CMB data (for flat universe). The projection noise
exceeds the shape noise only for clusters at z<=0.1 and has little effect on
the derived dark-energy constraints. Sample variance does not significantly
affect either survey. Finally, we note that all these results are extremely
sensitive to the noise levels and detection thresholds that we impose. They can
be significantly improved if we combine ground and space surveys as independent
experiments and add their corresponding Fisher matrices.",2006-05-31T19:54:53Z
Scalar-Tensor Models of Normal and Phantom Dark Energy,"We consider the viability of dark energy (DE) models in the framework of the
scalar-tensor theory of gravity, including the possibility to have a phantom DE
at small redshifts $z$ as admitted by supernova luminosity-distance data. For
small $z$, the generic solution for these models is constructed in the form of
a power series in $z$ without any approximation. Necessary constraints for DE
to be phantom today and to cross the phantom divide line $p=-\rho$ at small $z$
are presented. Considering the Solar System constraints, we find for the
post-Newtonian parameters that $\gamma_{PN}<1$ and $\gamma_{PN,0}\approx 1$ for
the model to be viable, and $\beta_{PN,0}>1$ (but very close to 1) if the model
has a significantly phantom DE today. However, prospects to establish the
phantom behaviour of DE are much better with cosmological data than with Solar
System experiments. Earlier obtained results for a $\Lambda$-dominated universe
with the vanishing scalar field potential are extended to a more general DE
equation of state confirming that the cosmological evolution of these models
rule them out. Models of currently fantom DE which are viable for small $z$ can
be easily constructed with a constant potential; however, they generically
become singular at some higher $z$. With a growing potential, viable models
exist up to an arbitrary high redshift.",2006-06-13T10:12:03Z
"4U 1344-60: a bright intermediate Seyfert galaxy at z=0.012 with a
  relativistic Fe Kalpha emission line","We present analysis of the optical and X-ray spectra of the low Galactic
latitude bright (F(2-10) = 3.6 10^{-11} erg/cm2/s) source 4U 1344-60. On the
basis of the optical data we propose to classify 4U 1344-60 as an intermediate
type Seyfert galaxy and we measure a value of z=0.012+/-0.001 for its redshift.
  From the XMM-Newton observation we find that the overall X-ray spectral shape
of 4U 1344-60 is complex and can be described by a power-law continuum (Gamma ~
1.55) obscured by two neutral absorption components (Nh(f) ~ 10^{22} cm^{-2}
and Nh(p) ~ 4 10^{22} cm^{-2}), the latter covering only the ~50% of the
primary X-ray source. The X-ray data therefore lend support to our
classification of 4U 1344-60. It exhibits a broad and skewed Fe Kalpha line at
6.4 keV, which suggests the existence of an accretion disk that is able to
reprocess the primary continuum down to a few gravitational radii. Such a line
represents one of the clearest examples of a relativistic line observed by
XMM-Newton so far. Our analysis has also revealed the marginal presence of two
narrow line-like emission features at ~4.9 and ~5.2 keV.",2006-03-27T08:29:33Z
"Search for Oxygen Emission from Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium around
  A2218 with Suzaku","We searched for redshifted O emission lines from the possible warm-hot
intergalactic medium (WHIM) surrounding the cluster of galaxies A2218 at
z=0.1756 using the XIS instrument on Suzaku. This cluster is thought to have an
elongated structure along the line of sight based on previous studies. We
studied systematic uncertainties in the spectrum of the Galactic emission and
in the soft X-ray response of the detectors due to the contamination building
up on the XIS filters. We detected no significant redshifted O lines, and set a
tight constraint on the intensity with upper limits for the surface brightness
of OVII and OVIII lines of 1.1 x 10^-7 and 3.0 x 10^-7 photons cm^-2 s^-1
arcmin^-2, respectively. These upper limits are significantly lower than the
previously reported fluxes from the WHIM around other clusters of galaxies. We
also discuss the prospect for the detection of the WHIM lines with Suzaku XIS
in the future.",2006-08-03T04:04:34Z
Star cluster disruption by giant molecular clouds,"We investigate encounters between giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and star
clusters. We propose a single expression for the energy gain of a cluster due
to an encounter with a GMC, valid for all encounter distances and GMC
properties. This relation is verified with N-body simulations of cluster-GMC
encounters and excellent agreement is found. The fractional mass loss from the
cluster is 0.25 times the fractional energy gain. This is because 75% of the
injected energy goes to the velocities of escaping stars, that are higher than
the escape velocity. We derive an expression for the cluster disruption time
(t_dis) based on the mass loss from the simulations, taking into account the
effect of gravitational focusing by the GMC. The disruption time depends on the
cluster mass (M_c) and half-mass radius (r_h) as t_dis=2.0 S (M_c/10^4
M_sun)(3.75 pc/r_h)^3 Gyr, with S=1 for the solar neighbourhood and inversely
proportional to the GMC density. The observed shallow relation between cluster
radius and mass gives t_dis a power-law dependence on the mass with index 0.7,
similar to that found from observations and from simulations of clusters
dissolving in tidal fields (0.62). The constant of 2.0 Gyr is about a factor of
3.5 shorter than found from earlier simulations of clusters dissolving under
the combined effect of galactic tidal field and stellar evolution. It is
somewhat higher than the observationally determined value of 1.3 Gyr. It
suggests, however, that the combined effect of tidal field and encounters with
GMCs can explain the lack of old open clusters in the solar neighbourhood. GMC
encounters can also explain the (very) short disruption time that was observed
for star clusters in the central region of M51, since there rho_n is an order
of magnitude higher than in the solar neighbourhood.",2006-06-19T15:06:45Z
Gravitational Waves from the First Stars,"We consider the stochastic background of gravitational waves produced by an
early generation of Population III stars coupled with a normal mode of star
formation at lower redshift. The computation is performed in the framework of
hierarchical structure formation and is based on cosmic star formation
histories constrained to reproduce the observed star formation rate at redshift
$z \la 6$, the observed chemical abundances in damped Lyman alpha absorbers and
in the intergalactic medium, and to allow for an early reionization of the
Universe at $z\sim 10-20$ as indicated by the first year results released by
WMAP. We find that the normal mode of star formation produces a gravitational
wave background which peaks at 300-500 Hz and is within LIGO III sensitivity.
The Population III component peaks at lower frequencies (30-100 Hz depending on
the model), and could be detected by LIGO III as well as the planned BBO and
DECIGO interferometers.",2006-03-20T21:00:36Z
"Host Galaxies of Hard X-ray Selected Type-2 Active Galactic Nuclei at
  Intermediate Redshifts","We study properties of the host galaxies of 15 hard X-ray selected type-2
active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at intermediate redshifts (0.05$<z<$0.6) detected
in $ASCA$ surveys. The absorption corrected hard X-ray luminosities $L_{\rm
2-10 keV}$ range from 10$^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ to $10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We took
the $R$-band image of these AGNs with the University of Hawaii 2.2 m telescope.
Thanks to the intrinsic obscuration of nuclear light, we can decompose the
galaxies with a spheroid component and a disk component. The resulting spheroid
luminosities correlate with $L_{\rm 2-10 keV}$; higher (lower) X-ray luminosity
AGNs tend to reside in luminous (less luminous) spheroids. It is also found
that the hosts of luminous AGNs show a large spheroid-to-disk luminosity ratio
($\sim$1), while those of less luminous AGNs spread between 0 and 1. The
correlation between $L_{\rm 2-10keV}$ and spheroid luminosity indicates that
the relation between mass of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) and spheroid
luminosity (BS-relation) at the intermediate redshifts. The BS-relation agrees
with that in the local universe if the Eddington ratio of 0.24 is adopted,
which is a mean value determined from our $ASCA$ type-1 AGN sample at similar
redshifts through the broad-line width and continuum luminosity. The present
study demonstrates the effectiveness of using type-2 AGNs at high redshifts to
study their host properties.",2006-04-13T06:39:26Z
"Adaptive Optics Correction of the Wavefront Distortions Induced by
  Segments Misalignment in Extremely Large Telescope","The capability of the adaptive optics to correct for the segmentation error
is analyzed in terms of the residual wavefront RMS and the power spectral
density of the phase. The analytical model and the end-to-end simulation give
qualitatively equal results justifying the significance of the geometrical
matching between segmentation geometry and the actuators/subaperture
distribution of the adaptive optics. We also show that the design of the
wavefront sensor is rather critical.",2006-06-16T11:59:50Z
Hypernova Signatures in the Late Rebrightening of GRB 050525A,"We report observations of GRB 050525A, for which a Gemini North spectrum
shows its redshift to be z = 0.606. This is the third closest long GRB
discovered by Swift. We observed its afterglow using the VLT, Gemini and TNG
telescopes to search for an associated SN. We find that the early-time light
curve is described by a broken power law with a break at t ~ 0.3 d after the
burst. About 5 d after the burst, a flattening is apparent, followed by a
further dimming. Both the magnitude and the shape of the light curve suggest
that a supernova was emerging during the late decay of the afterglow. This
supernova, dubbed SN 2005nc, had a rise time faster than SN 1998bw and a
long-lasting maximum. A spectrum obtained about 20 d (rest-frame) after the GRB
resembles the spectrum of SN 1998bw obtained close to maximum light.",2006-04-05T19:31:49Z
"Swift Observations of GRB 050603: An afterglow with a steep late time
  decay slope","We report the results of Swift observations of the Gamma Ray Burst GRB
050603. With a V magnitude V=18.2 about 10 hours after the burst the optical
afterglow was the brightest so far detected by Swift and one of the brightest
optical afterglows ever seen. The Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) light curves show
three fast-rise-exponential-decay spikes with $T_{90}$=12s and a fluence of
7.6$\times 10^{-6}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ in the 15-150 keV band. With an $E_{\rm
\gamma, iso} = 1.26 \times 10^{54}$ ergs it was also one of the most energetic
bursts of all times. The Swift spacecraft began observing of the afterglow with
the narrow-field instruments about 10 hours after the detection of the burst.
The burst was bright enough to be detected by the Swift UV/Optical telescope
(UVOT) for almost 3 days and by the X-ray Telescope (XRT) for a week after the
burst. The X-ray light curve shows a rapidly fading afterglow with a decay
index $\alpha$=1.76$^{+0.15}_{-0.07}$. The X-ray energy spectral index was
$\beta_{\rm X}$=0.71\plm0.10 with the column density in agreement with the
Galactic value. The spectral analysis does not show an obvious change in the
X-ray spectral slope over time. The optical UVOT light curve decays with a
slope of $\alpha$=1.8\plm0.2.
  The steepness and the similarity of the optical and X-ray decay rates suggest
that the afterglow was observed after the jet break. We estimate a jet opening
angle of about 1-2$^{\circ}$",2006-03-16T15:27:42Z
Have we detected the most luminous ULX so far?,"We report the XMM-Newton detection of a moderately bright X-ray source
superimposed on the outer arms of the inactive spiral galaxy MCG-03-34-63
(z=0.0213). It is clearly offset from the nucleus (by about 19'') but well
within the D25 ellipse of the galaxy, just along its bar axis. The field has
also been observed with the HST enabling us to compute a lower limit of > 94 on
the X-ray to optical flux ratio which, together with the X-ray spectrum of the
source, argues against a background AGN. On the other hand, the detection of
excess X-ray absorption and the lack of a bright optical counterpart argue
against foreground contamination. Short-timescale variability is observed,
ruling out the hypothesis of a particularly powerful supernova. If it is
associated with the apparent host galaxy, the source is the most powerful ULX
detected so far with a peak luminosity of 1.35x10^41 erg/s in the 0.5-7 keV
band. If confirmed by future multi-wavelength observations, the inferred
bolometric luminosity (about 3x10^41 erg/s) requires a rather extreme beaming
factor (larger than 115) to accommodate accretion onto a stellar-mass black
hole of 20 solar masses and the source could represent instead one of the best
intermediate-mass black hole candidate so far. If beaming is excluded, the
Eddington limit implies a mass of >2300 solar masses for the accreting compact
object.",2006-07-21T12:54:52Z
"A weak lensing estimate from GEMS of the virial to stellar mass ratio in
  massive galaxies to z~0.8","We present constraints on the evolution of the virial to stellar mass ratio
of galaxies with high stellar masses in the redshift range 0.2<z<0.8, by
comparing weak lensing measurements of virial mass M_vir to estimates of
stellar mass M_star from COMBO-17. For a complete sample of galaxies with
log(M_star/ M_\odot) > 10.5, where the majority show an early-type morphology,
we find that the virial mass to stellar mass ratio is given by M_vir/M_star =
53^{+13}_{-16}. Assuming a baryon fraction from the concordance cosmology, this
corresponds to a stellar fraction of baryons in massive galaxies of
Omega_b^*/\Omega_b = 0.10 +/- 0.03. Analysing the galaxy sample in different
redshift slices, we find little or no evolution in the virial to stellar mass
ratio, and place an upper limit of ~2.5 on the growth of massive galaxies
through the conversion of gas into stars from z=0.8 to the present day.",2006-06-16T23:02:48Z
The first Swift X-ray Flash: The faint afterglow of XRF 050215B,"We present the discovery of XRF 050215B and its afterglow. The burst was
detected by the Swift BAT during the check-out phase and observations with the
X-ray telescope began approximately 30 minutes after the burst. These
observations found a faint, slowly fading X-ray afterglow near the centre of
the error box as reported by the BAT. Infrared data, obtained at UKIRT after 10
hours also revealed a very faint K-band afterglow. The afterglow appear unusual
since it is very faint, especially in the infrared with K>20 only 9 hours post
burst. The X-ray and infrared lightcurves exhibit a slow, monotonic decay with
alpha=0.8 and no evidence for steepening associated with the jet break to 10
days post burst. We discuss possible explanations for the faintness and slow
decay in the context of present models for the production of X-ray Flashes.",2006-05-10T12:43:35Z
Mosaicking with cosmic microwave background interferometers,"Measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies by
interferometers offer several advantages over single-dish observations. The
formalism for analyzing interferometer CMB data is well developed in the
flat-sky approximation, valid for small fields of view. As the area of sky is
increased to obtain finer spectral resolution, this approximation needs to be
relaxed. We extend the formalism for CMB interferometry, including both
temperature and polarization, to mosaics of observations covering arbitrarily
large areas of the sky, with each individual pointing lying within the flat-sky
approximation. We present a method for computing the correlation between
visibilities with arbitrary pointing centers and baselines and illustrate the
effects of sky curvature on the l-space resolution that can be obtained from a
mosaic.",2006-06-19T16:45:27Z
Infrared observations of V838 Mon,"We describe the results of fitting simple spherically symmetric models to the
first overtone CO and AlO A-X (2-0) bands in V838 Mon. We find that the
temperature and column of both CO and AlO systematically decline over the
period 2002 October - 2005 February and that an additional, hotter and denser,
component is present from 2005 January. We also describe the results of an
observation of the star and its light echo at 850micron. We do not detect the
`infrared' echo at these wavelength, and place an upper limit of 3x10^7 cm^-2
on the column of grains.",2006-06-20T17:20:07Z
Close Galaxy Counts as a Probe of Hierarchical Structure Formation,"Standard LCDM predicts that the major merger rate of galaxy-size dark matter
halos rises rapidly with redshift. The average number of close companions per
galaxy, Nc, is often used to infer the galaxy merger rate, however, recent
observational studies suggest that Nc evolves very little with redshift. Here
we use a ""hybrid"" N- body simulation plus analytic substructure model to
predict Nc directly. We identify dark matter subhalos with galaxies and show
that the observed lack of close pair count evolution arises because the high
merger rate per halo at early times is counteracted by a decrease in the number
of halos massive enough to host a galaxy pair. We compare our results to data
compiled from the DEEP2, SSRS2, and the UZC redshift surveys. Observed pair
counts match our predictions if we assume a monotonic mapping between galaxy
luminosity and the maximum circular velocity that each subhalo had when it was
first accreted onto its host halo. This suggests that satellite galaxies are
significantly more resilient to destruction than are dissipationless dark
matter subhalos. We argue that while Nc does not provide a direct measure of
the halo merger rate, it offers a powerful means to constrain the Halo
Occupation Distribution and the spatial distribution of galaxies within halos.
Interpreted in this way, close pair counts provide a useful test of galaxy
formation processes on < 100 kpc scales.",2006-04-24T22:40:19Z
"Millimagnitude Optical Photometry for the Transiting Planetary Candidate
  OGLE-TR-109","We present precise V-band photometry for the low-amplitude transit candidate
star OGLE-TR-109. This is an extreme case among the transiting candidates found
by the OGLE group because of the early spectral type of the star (F0V), of the
low transit amplitude (A_I=0.008 mag), and of the very short period (P=0.58909
days) of the orbiting companion. Using difference image photometry, we are able
to achieve millimagnitude errors in the individual data points. One transit of
this star is well defined in our light curve. This confirms the OGLE detection
and rules out the possibility of a false positive. The measurement of this
transit allows to refine the transit amplitude (A_V=0.006 +/- 0.001 mag), and
the ephemerides for this interesting system, as well as the radius of the
possible orbiting companion (R_P=0.90 +/- 0.09 ~R_J), and the inclination of
the orbit (i=77 +/- 5 deg). Two other transits observed at lower S/N confirm
the period of this system measured by OGLE. There is no evidence for a blend of
the F-type main sequence star with a redder eclipsing binary, or for secondary
transits in the present observations. The absence of ellipsoidal modulation in
the light curve of the primary rules out a low mass star companion or brown
dwarf with M>14 +/- 8 M_J. The remaining possibilities for OGLE-TR-109 are a
blend between the F-type star and a binary with a bluer primary star, or a new
transiting extrasolar planet.",2006-04-12T22:52:59Z
X-ray Spectral Study of the Photoionized Stellar Wind in Vela~X-1,"We present results from quantitative modeling and spectral analysis of the
high mass X-ray binary Vela X-1 obtained with the Chandra HETGS. The spectra
exhibit emission lines from H-like and He-like ions driven by photoionization,
as well as fluorescent emission lines from several elements in lower charge
states. In order to interpret and make full use of the high-quality data, we
have developed a simulator, which calculates the ionization and thermal
structure of a stellar wind photoionized by an X-ray source, and performs Monte
Carlo simulations of X-ray photons propagating through the wind. The emergent
spectra are then computed as a function of the viewing angle accurately
accounting for photon transport in three dimensions including dynamics. From
comparisons of the observed spectra with the simulation results, we are able to
find the ionization structure and the geometrical distribution of material in
Vela X-1 that can reproduce the observed spectral line intensities and
continuum shapes at different orbital phases remarkably well. It is found that
a large fraction of X-ray emission lines from highly ionized ions are formed in
the region between the neutron star and the companion star. We also find that
the fluorescent X-ray lines must be produced in at least three distinct regions
--(1)the extended stellar wind, (2)reflection off the stellar photosphere, and
(3)in a distribution of dense material partially covering and possibly trailing
the neutron star, which may be associated with an accretion wake. Finally, from
detailed analysis of the emission lines, we demonstrate that the stellar wind
is affected by X-ray photoionization.",2006-07-03T14:00:47Z
Cosmic Conspiracies,"The now standard vanilla-flavoured LambdaCDM model has gained further
confirmation with the release of the 3-year WMAP data combined with several
other cosmological data-sets. As the parameters of this standard model become
known with increasing precision, more of its bizarre features become apparent.
Here we describe some of the strangest of these ostensible coincidences. In
particular we appear to live (within 1sigma) at the precise epoch when the age
of the Universe multiplied by the Hubble parameter H_0 t_0 = 1.",2006-04-02T06:36:24Z
"GaBoDS: The Garching-Bonn Deep Survey -- IX. A sample of 158
  shear-selected mass concentration candidates","The aim of the present work is the construction of a mass-selected galaxy
cluster sample based on weak gravitational lensing methods. This sample will be
subject to spectroscopic follow-up observations.
  We apply the mass aperture statistics and a derivative of it to 19 square
degrees of high quality, single colour wide field imaging data obtained with
the WFI@MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope. For the statistics a family of filter functions
is used that approximates the expected tangential radial shear profile and thus
allows for the efficient detection of mass concentrations.
  We identify 158 possible mass concentrations. This is the first time that
such a large and blindly selected sample is published. 72 of the detections are
associated with concentrations of bright galaxies. For about 22 of those we
found spectra in the literature, indicating or proving that the galaxies seen
are indeed spatially concentrated. 15 of those were previously known to be
clusters or have meanwhile been secured as such. We currently follow-up a
larger number of them spectroscopically to obtain deeper insight into their
physical properties. The remaining 55% of the possible mass concentrations
found are not associated with any optical light, or could not be classified
unambiguously. We show that those ""dark"" detections are to a significant degree
due to noise, and appear preferentially in shallow data.",2006-07-03T13:42:47Z
Scalar-Tensor Models of Normal and Phantom Dark Energy,"We consider the viability of dark energy (DE) models in the framework of the
scalar-tensor theory of gravity, including the possibility to have a phantom DE
at small redshifts $z$ as admitted by supernova luminosity-distance data. For
small $z$, the generic solution for these models is constructed in the form of
a power series in $z$ without any approximation. Necessary constraints for DE
to be phantom today and to cross the phantom divide line $p=-\rho$ at small $z$
are presented. Considering the Solar System constraints, we find for the
post-Newtonian parameters that $\gamma_{PN}<1$ and $\gamma_{PN,0}\approx 1$ for
the model to be viable, and $\beta_{PN,0}>1$ (but very close to 1) if the model
has a significantly phantom DE today. However, prospects to establish the
phantom behaviour of DE are much better with cosmological data than with Solar
System experiments. Earlier obtained results for a $\Lambda$-dominated universe
with the vanishing scalar field potential are extended to a more general DE
equation of state confirming that the cosmological evolution of these models
rule them out. Models of currently fantom DE which are viable for small $z$ can
be easily constructed with a constant potential; however, they generically
become singular at some higher $z$. With a growing potential, viable models
exist up to an arbitrary high redshift.",2006-06-13T10:12:03Z
Planetary Nebulae as Probes of Stellar Populations,"Planetary nebulae (PNe) have the potential to revolutionize our understanding
of extragalactic stellar populations. Indeed, in many systems, bright PNe are
the only individual objects identifiable from the ground, and, even more often,
they are the only stars that are amenable to spectroscopy. We review the ways
in which ensembles of PNe can be used to probe the metallicity, age, and
history of a stellar population. In particular, we discuss three cases: the
weak line spectroscopic regime, where one has knowledge of the line-strengths
of faint forbidden lines such as [O III] 4363, a bright-line regime, where only
the strongest emission lines are visible, and the photometric regime, where the
only information available is the [O III] 5007 luminosity function. We show
that each of these cases, when properly calibrated, can provide unique insights
into the objects that make up a stellar population.",2006-05-02T18:35:09Z
Direct X-ray Constraints on Sterile Neutrino Warm Dark Matter,"Warm dark matter (WDM) might more easily account for small scale clustering
measurements than the heavier particles typically invoked in Lambda cold dark
matter (LCDM) cosmologies. In this paper, we consider a Lambda WDM cosmology in
which sterile neutrinos nu_s, with a mass m_s of roughly 1-100 keV, are the
dark matter. We use the diffuse X-ray spectrum (total minus resolved point
source emission) of the Andromeda galaxy to constrain the rate of sterile
neutrino radiative decay: nu_s -> nu_{e,mu,tau} + gamma. Our findings demand
that m_s < 3.5 keV (95% C.L.) which is a significant improvement over the
previous (95% C.L.) limits inferred from the X-ray emission of nearby clusters,
m_s < 8.2 keV (Virgo A) and m_s < 6.3 keV (Virgo A + Coma).",2006-05-17T19:00:52Z
"Tagging single muons and other long-flying relativistic charged
  particles by ultra-fast timing in air Cherenkov telescopes","Atmospheric air Cherenkov telescopes are successfully used for ground-based,
very high-energy (VHE) gamma ray astronomy. Triggers from the so-called single
muon and other long-flying relativistic charged particle events are an unwanted
background for the Cherenkov telescope. Because of low rate at TeV energies the
muon background is unimportant. It is much more intense for telescopes with
high photon sensitivity and low energy threshold. Below a few hundred GeV
energy, the so-called muon background becomes so intense, that it can
deteriorate the sensitivity of telescopes (the so-called muon-wall problem).
  From general considerations it can be anticipated that the signature of these
particles should be a light pulse with a narrow time structure. In fact,
simulations show that the pulses from muons have a very narrow time profile
that is well below the time resolutions of nearly all currently operating
telescopes. In this report we elaborate on the time profile of Cherenkov light
from the so-called single muons and show that a telescope with ultra-fast time
response can open a new dimension allowing one to tag and to reject those
events.",2006-05-03T13:57:16Z
The Discovery of Cepheids and a Distance to NGC 5128,"We discuss a new distance to NGC 5128 (Centaurus A) based on Cepheid
variables observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Twelve F555W (V) and six
F814W (I) epochs of cosmic-ray-split Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 observations
were obtained. A total of 56 bona-fide Cepheids were discovered, with periods
ranging from 5 to ~50 days; five of these are likely Population II Cepheids of
the W Virginis class, associated with the bulge or halo of NGC 5128. Based on
the period and V and I-band luminosities of a sub-sample of 42 classical (Pop
I) Cepheids, and adopting a Large Magellanic Cloud distance modulus and
extinction of 18.50 +/- 0.10 mag and E(B-V)=0.10 mag, respectively, the true
reddening-corrected distance modulus to NGC 5128 is mu_0 = 27.67 +/- 0.12
(random)+/- 0.16 (systematic) mag, corresponding to a distance of 3.42 +/- 0.18
(random) +/- 0.25 (systematic) Mpc. The random uncertainty in the distance is
dominated by the error on the assumed value for the ratio of total to selective
absorption, R_V, in NGC 5128, and by the possible metallicity dependence of the
Cepheid Period-Luminosity relation at V and I. This represent the first
determination of a Cepheid distance to an early-type galaxy.",2006-05-29T20:17:33Z
What mass are the smallest protohalos?,"We calculate the kinetic-decoupling temperature for weakly interacting
massive particles (WIMPs) in supersymmetric (SUSY) and
universal-extra-dimension (UED) models that can account for the
cold-dark-matter abundance determined from cosmic microwave background
measurements. Depending on the parameters of the particle-physics model, a wide
variety of decoupling temperatures is possible, ranging from several MeV to a
few GeV. These decoupling temperatures imply a range of masses for the smallest
protohalos much larger than previously thought -- ranging from 10^{-6} earth
masses to 10^{2} earth masses. We expect the range of protohalos masses derived
here to be characteristic of most particle-physics models that can thermally
accommodate the required relic abundance of WIMP dark matter, even beyond SUSY
and UED.",2006-03-14T21:00:03Z
"Scientific Results from High-precision Astrometry at the Palomar Testbed
  Interferometer","A new observing mode for the Palomar Testbed Interferometer was developed
in2002-2003 which enables differential astrometry at the level of 20
micro-arcseconds for binary systems with separations of several hundred
milli-arcseconds (mas). This phase-referenced mode is the basis of the Palomar
High-precision Astrometric Search for Exoplanet Systems (PHASES), a search for
giant planets orbiting either the primary or secondary star in fifty binary
systems. We present the first science results from the PHASES search. The
properties of the stars comprising binary systems are determined to high
precision. The mutual inclinations of several hierarchical triple star systems
have been determined. We will present upper limits constraining the the
existence of giant planets in a few of the target systems.",2006-05-31T01:37:53Z
AL 3 (BH 261): a new globular cluster in the Galaxy,"AL~3 (BH 261), previously classified as a faint open cluster candidate, is
shown to be a new globular cluster in the Milky Way, by means of B, V and I
Color-Magnitude Diagrams. The main feature of AL~3 is a prominent blue extended
Horizontal Branch. Its Color-Magnitude Diagrams match those of the intermediate
metallicity cluster M~5. The cluster is projected in a rich bulge field, also
contaminated by the disk main sequence. The globular cluster is located in the
Galactic bulge at a distance from the Sun d$_{\odot}$ = 6.0$\pm$0.5 kpc. The
reddening is E(B-V)=0.36$\pm$0.03 and the metallicity is estimated to be [Fe/H]
$\approx$ -1.3$\pm$0.25. AL~3 is probably one of the least massive globular
clusters of the Galaxy.",2006-06-29T12:33:57Z
Quantum noise and large-scale cosmic microwave background anisotropy,"We propose a new source for the cosmological density perturbation which is
passive fluctuations of the inflaton driven dynamically by a colored quantum
noise as a result of its coupling to other massive quantum fields. The created
fluctuations grow with time during inflation before horizon-crossing. However,
the larger-scale modes cross out the horizon earlier, thus resulting in a
suppression of their density perturbation as compared with those on small
scales. By using current observed CMB data to constrain the parameters
introudced, we find that a significant contribution from the noise-driven
perturbation to the density perturbation is still allowed. It in turn gives
rise to a suppression of the large-scale CMB anisotropy that may be relevant to
the observed low quadrupole in the WMAP CMB anisotropy data. We also briefly
discuss the implications to the energy scale of inflation and the spectral
index and non-Gaussianity of the density perturbation.",2006-04-13T07:23:51Z
Natural Downsizing in Hierarchical Galaxy Formation,"Stellar-population analyses of today's galaxies show ""downsizing"", where the
stars in more massive galaxies tend to have formed earlier and over a shorter
time span. We show that this phenomenon is not necessarily ""anti-hierarchical""
but rather has its natural roots in the bottom-up clustering process of
dark-matter haloes. While the main progenitor does indeed show an opposite
effect, the integrated mass in all the progenitors down to a given minimum mass
shows a robust downsizing that is qualitatively similar to what has been
observed. These results are derived analytically from the standard extended
Press Schechter (EPS) theory, and are confirmed by merger trees based on EPS or
drawn from N-body simulations. The downsizing is valid for any minimum mass, as
long as it is the same for all haloes at any given time, but the effect is
weaker for smaller minimum mass. If efficient star formation is triggered by
atomic cooling, then a minimum halo mass arises naturally from the minimum
virial temperature for cooling, T~10^4 K, though for such a small minimum mass
the effect is weaker than observed. Baryonic feedback effects, which are
expected to stretch the duration of star formation in small galaxies and shut
it down in massive haloes at late epochs, are likely to play a subsequent role
in shaping up the final downsizing behaviour. Other appearances of downsizing,
such as the decline with time of the typical mass of star-forming galaxies, may
not be attributed to the gravitational clustering process but rather arise from
the gas processes.",2006-05-01T22:57:25Z
"The Association of Compact Groups of Galaxies with Large-scale
  Structures","We use various samples of compact groups (CGs) to examine the types of
association CGs have with rich and poor clusters of galaxies at low (z~0.04)
and intermediate (z~0.1) redshifts. We find that ~10-20 % of CGs are associated
with rich clusters and a much larger fraction with poorer clusters or loose
groups. Considering the incompleteness of catalogs of poorer systems at
intermediate redshift, our result is consistent with all CGs at intermediate
redshift being associated with larger-scale systems. The richness of the
clusters associated with CGs significantly increases from z~0.04 to z~0.1,
while their Bautz-Morgan type changes from early to late type for the same
range in z. Neither trend is compatible with a selection effect in the cluster
catalogs used. We find earlier morphological types of galaxies to be more
frequent in CGs associated with larger-scale structures, compared to those in
CGs not associated to such structures. We consider this as new evidence that
CGs are part of the large-scale structure formation process and that they may
play an important role in the evolution of galaxies in these structures.",2006-03-12T23:38:46Z
"SPITZER Observations of z~3 Lyman Break Galaxies: stellar masses and
  mid-infrared properties","We describe the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of Lyman Break Galaxies
(LBGs) at z~3 using deep mid-infrared and optical observations of the Extended
Groth Strip, obtained with IRAC and MIPS on board Spitzer and from the ground,
respectively. We focus on LBGs with detections at all four IRAC bands, in
particular the 26 galaxies with IRAC 8 micron band (rest--frame K-band)
detections. We use stellar population synthesis models and probe the stellar
content of these galaxies. Based on best--fit continuous star-formation models
we derive estimates of the stellar mass for these LBGs. As in previous studies,
we find that a fraction of LBGs have very red colors and large estimated
stellar masses (M_stellar > 5 x 10 ^{10} M_solar): the present Spitzer data
allow us, for the first time, to study these massive LBGs in detail. We discuss
the link between these LBGs and submm-luminous galaxies.We find that the number
density of these massive LBGs at high redshift is higher than predicted by
current semi-analytic models of galaxy evolution.",2006-05-15T11:09:07Z
Diffraction-Based Sensitivity Analysis of Apodized Pupil Mapping Systems,"Pupil mapping is a promising and unconventional new method for high contrast
imaging being considered for terrestrial exoplanet searches. It employs two (or
more) specially designed aspheric mirrors to create a high-contrast amplitude
profile across the telescope pupil that does not appreciably attenuate
amplitude. As such, it reaps significant benefits in light collecting
efficiency and inner working angle, both critical parameters for terrestrial
planet detection. While much has been published on various aspects of pupil
mapping systems, the problem of sensitivity to wavefront aberrations remains an
open question. In this paper, we present an efficient method for computing the
sensitivity of a pupil mapped system to Zernike aberrations. We then use this
method to study the sensitivity of a particular pupil mapping system and
compare it to the concentric-ring shaped pupil coronagraph. In particular, we
quantify how contrast and inner working angle degrade with increasing Zernike
order and rms amplitude. These results have obvious ramifications for the
stability requirements and overall design of a planet-finding observatory.",2006-05-25T04:26:54Z
"High Contrast L' Band Adaptive Optics Imaging to Detect Extrasolar
  Planets","We are carrying out a survey to search for giant extrasolar planets around
nearby, moderate-age stars in the mid-infrared L' and M bands (3.8 and 4.8
microns, respectively), using the Clio camera with the adaptive optics system
on the MMT telescope. To date we have observed 7 stars, of a total 50 planned,
including GJ 450 (distance about 8.55pc, age about 1 billion years, no real
companions detected), which we use as our example here. We report the methods
we use to obtain extremely high contrast imaging in L', and the performance we
have obtained. We find that the rotation of a celestial object over time with
respect to a telescope tracking it with an altazimuth mount can be a powerful
tool for subtracting telescope-related stellar halo artifacts and detecting
planets near bright stars. We have carried out a thorough Monte Carlo
simulation demonstrating our ability to detect planets as small as 6 Jupiter
masses around GJ 450. The division of a science data set into two independent
parts, with companions required to be detected on both in order to be
recognized as real, played a crucial role in detecting companions in this
simulation. We mention also our discovery of a previously unknown faint stellar
companion to another of our survey targets, HD 133002. Followup is needed to
confirm this as a physical companion, and to determine its physical properties.",2006-06-19T18:57:38Z
"X-ray observations of the mass and entropy distributions in nearby

On the metallicity dependence of HMXBs,"It is commonly assumed that high mass X-ray binary (HMXB) populations are
little-affected by metallicity. However, the massive stars making up their
progenitor systems depend on metallicity in a number of ways, not least through
their winds. We present simulations, well-matched to the observed sample of
Galactic HMXBs, which demonstrate that both the number and the mean period of
HMXB progenitors can vary with metallicity, with the number increasing by about
a factor of three between solar and SMC metallicity. However, the SMC
population itself cannot be explained simply by metallicity effects; it
requires both that the HMXBs observed therein primarily sample the older end of
the HMXB population, and that the star formation rate at the time of their
formation was very large.",2006-06-08T16:55:18Z
"Capella Corona Revisited: A Combined View from \textit{XMM-Newton} RGS,
  \textit{Chandra} HETGS, and LETGS","We present a combined analysis of the X-ray emission of the Capella corona
obtained with \textit{XMM-Newton} RGS, \textit{Chandra} HETGS, and LETGS. An
improved atomic line database and a new differential emission measure (DEM)
deconvolution method are developed for this purpose. Our new atomic database is
based on the Astrophysical Plasma Emission Database and incorporates improved
calculations of ionization equilibrium and line emissivities for L-shell ions
of abundant elements using the Flexible Atomic Code. The new DEM deconvolution
method uses a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) technique which differs from
existing MCMC or $\chi^2$-fitting based methods. We analyze the advantages and
disadvantages of each individual instrument in determining the DEM and
elemental abundances. We conclude that results from either RGS or HETGS data
alone are not robust enough due to their failure to constrain DEM in some
temperature region or the lack of significant continuum emission in the
wavelength band of the spectrometers, and that the combination of HETGS and RGS
gives more stringent constraints on the DEM and abundance determinations. Using
the LETGS data, we show that the recently discovered inconsistencies between
the EUV and X-ray lines of Fe XVIII and XIX also exist in more highly charged
iron ions, up to Fe XXIII, and that enhanced interstellar absorption due to
partially ionized plasma along the Capella line of sight may explain some, but
not all, of these discrepancies.",2006-06-12T21:19:38Z
Gravitational instability via the Schrodinger equation,"We explore a novel approach to the study of large-scale structure formation
in which self-gravitating cold dark matter (CDM) is represented by a complex
scalar field whose dynamics are governed by coupled Schrodinger and Poisson
equations. We show that, in the quasi-linear regime, the Schrodinger equation
can be reduced to the free-particle Schrodinger equation. We advocate using the
free-particle Schrodinger equation as the basis of a new approximation method -
the free-particle approximation - that is similar in spirit to the successful
adhesion model. In this paper we test the free-particle approximation by
appealing to a planar collapse scenario and find that our results are in
excellent agreement with those of the Zeldovich approximation, provided care is
taken when choosing a value for the effective Planck constant in the theory. We
also discuss how extensions of the free-particle approximation are likely to
require the inclusion of a time-dependent potential in the Schrodinger
equation. Since the Schrodinger equation with a time-dependent potential is
typically impossible to solve exactly, we investigate whether standard
quantum-mechanical approximation techniques can be used, in a cosmological
setting, to obtain useful solutions of the Schrodinger equation. In this paper
we focus on one particular approximation method: time-dependent perturbation
theory (TDPT). We elucidate the properties of perturbative solutions of the
Schrodinger equation by considering a simple example: the gravitational
evolution of a plane-symmetric density fluctuation. We use TDPT to calculate an
approximate solution of the relevant Schrodinger equation and show that this
perturbative solution can be used to successfully follow gravitational collapse
beyond the linear regime, but there are several pitfalls to be avoided.",2006-04-29T18:13:24Z
"Polarization in the prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts and their
  afterglows","Synchrotron is considered the dominant emission mechanism in the production
of gamma-ray burst photons in the prompt as well as in the afterglow phase.
Polarization is a characteristic feature of synchrotron and its study can
reveal a wealth of information on the properties of the magnetic field and of
the energy distribution in gamma-ray burst jets. In this paper I will review
the theory and observations of gamma-ray bursts polarization. While the theory
is well established, observations have prove difficult to perform, due to the
weakness of the signal. The discriminating power of polarization observations,
however, cannot be overestimated.",2006-07-31T16:59:02Z
"Leptonic emission from microquasar jets: from radio to very high-energy
  gamma-rays","Microquasars are sources of very high-energy gamma-rays and, very probably,
high-energy gamma-ray emitters. We propose a model for a jet that can allow to
give accurate observational predictions for jet emission at different energies
and provide with physical information of the object using multiwavelength data.",2006-05-18T18:54:02Z
A Cloudy/Xspec Interface,"We discuss new functionality of the spectral simulation code CLOUDY which
allows the user to calculate grids with one or more initial parameters varied
and formats the predicted spectra in the standard FITS format. These files can
then be imported into the x-ray spectral analysis software XSPEC and used as
theoretical models for observations. We present and verify a test case.
Finally, we consider a few observations and discuss our results.",2006-06-01T18:04:25Z
The Stellar Mass Density at z~6 from Spitzer Imaging of i-drop Galaxies,"We measure the ages, stellar masses, and star formation histories of z~6
galaxies, observed within 1Gyr of the Big Bang. We use imaging from HST and
Spitzer from the public ""Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey"", coupled with
ground-based near-infrared imaging, to measure the spectral energy
distributions from 0.8-5microns, spanning the rest-frame UV and optical. From
our sample of ~50 i-drop Lyman-break star-forming galaxies in GOODS-South with
z'(AB)<27mag, we focus on ~30 with reliable photometric or spectroscopic
redshifts. Half of these are confused with foreground sources at Spitzer
resolution, but from the 16 with clean photometry we find that a surprisingly
large fraction (40%) have evidence for substantial Balmer-breaks. This
indicates the presence of old underlying stellar populations that dominate the
stellar masses. For these objects, we find ages of 200-700Myr, implying
formation redshifts of 7<z<14, and large stellar masses in the range
1-3x10^10M_sun. Analysis of 7 i-drops that are undetected at 3.6microns
indicates that these are younger, considerably less massive systems. We
calculate that line contamination should not severely affect our photometry or
derived results. Using data out to 8microns, we find little evidence for
substantial intrinsic dust reddening. Correcting for incompleteness in our
sample, we find a lower limit on the comoving stellar mass density at z~6 to be
2.5x10^6M_sun/Mpc^3. We are able to explore the star formation histories of our
selected galaxies, and we infer that the past global star formation rate may
have been much higher than that observed at z~6. The associated UV flux we
infer at z>7 could have played a major role in reionizing the universe.",2006-07-14T19:57:46Z
"Reconstruction of Neutrino-Induced Hadronic and Electromagnetic Showers
  with the ANTARES Experiment","The ANTARES neutrino telescope is being constructed at a site off the French
Mediterranean coast at a depth of 2400m. When high energy neutrinos interact in
water, the charged secondary particles produce Cherenkov light which can be
measured in photomultiplier tubes. Different event signatures are possible;
this work introduces a reconstruction algorithm for events with a hadronic and
potentially an electromagnetic shower producing a signal in the detector. An
algorithm for the combined reconstruction of shower direction and energy is
described, based on a maximum likelihood fit which matches the signal expected
in the photomultipliers for an assumed direction and energy with the signal
actually measured.",2006-06-28T20:56:10Z
"What triggers galaxy transformations? The environments of post-starburst
  galaxies","(abridged) There are good observational reasons to believe that the
progenitors of red galaxies have undergone starbursts, followed by a
post-starburst phase. We investigate the environments of post-starburst
galaxies by measuring \textsl{(1)} number densities in $8 h^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}$
radius comoving spheres, \textsl{(2)} transverse distances to nearest
Virgo-like galaxy clusters, and \textsl{(3)} transverse distances to nearest
luminous-galaxy neighbors. We compare the post-starburst galaxies to currently
star-forming galaxies identified solely by A-star excess or $\Halpha$ emission.
We find that post-starburst galaxies are in the same kinds of environments as
star-forming galaxies; this is our ``null hypothesis''. More importantly, we
find that at each value of the A-star excess, the star-forming and
post-starburst galaxies lie in very similar distributions of environment. The
only deviations from our null hypothesis are barely significant: a slight
deficit of post-starburst galaxies (relative to the star-forming population) in
very low-density regions, a small excess inside the virial radii of clusters,
and a slight excess with nearby neighbors. None of these effects is strong
enough to make the post-starburst galaxies a high-density phenomenon, or to
argue that the starburst events are primarily triggered by external tidal
impulses (e.g., from close passages of massive galaxies). The small excess
inside cluster virial radii suggests that some post-starbursts are triggered by
interactions with the intracluster medium, but this represents a very small
fraction of all post-starburst galaxies.",2006-06-23T19:55:00Z
High Accuracy Matching of Planetary Images,"We address the question of to what accuracy remote sensing images of the
surface of planets can be matched, so that the possible displacement of
features on the surface can be accurately measured. This is relevant in the
context of the libration experiment aboard the European Space Agency's
BepiColombo mission to Mercury. We focus here only on the algorithmic aspects
of the problem, and disregard all other sources of error (spacecraft position,
calibration uncertainties, etc.) that would have to be taken into account. We
conclude that for a wide range of illumination conditions, translations between
images can be recovered to about one tenth of a pixel r.m.s.",2006-06-22T12:14:29Z
On the limit cycle instability in magnetized accretion discs,"Observational evidence accumulated over the past decade indicates that
accretion discs in X-ray binaries are viscously stable unless they accrete very
close to the Eddington limit. This is at odds with the most basic standard
accretion disc theory, but could be explained by either having the discs to be
much cooler whereby they are not radiation pressure dominated, or by a more
sophisticated viscosity law. Here we argue that the latter is taking place in
practice, on the basis of a stability analysis that assumes that the
magneto-rotational-instability (MRI) responsible for generating the turbulent
stresses inside the discs is also the source for a magnetically dominated
corona. We show that observations of stable discs in the high/soft states of
black hole binaries, on the one hand, and of the strongly variable microquasar
GRS 1915+105 on the other, can all be explained if the magnetic turbulent
stresses inside the disc scale proportionally to the geometric mean of gas and
total pressure with a constant of proportionality (viscosity parameter) having
a value of a few times 10^{-2}. Implications for bright AGN are also briefly
discussed",2006-03-07T14:10:38Z
Detection of the ISW effect and corresponding dark energy constraints,"Using a directional spherical wavelet analysis we detect the integrated
Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, indicated by a positive correlation between the
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS)
data, at the 3.9 sigma level. In a flat universe the detection of the ISW
effect provides direct and independent evidence for dark energy. Moreover, we
use our detection to constrain the dark energy density Omega_Lambda. We obtain
estimates for Omega_Lambda consistent with other analysis techniques and data
sets and rule out a zero cosmological constant at greater than 99%
significance.",2006-05-04T10:21:04Z
Analysis to the entangled states from an extended Chaplygin gas model,"With considerations of the recently released WMAP year three and supernova
legacy survey (SNLS) data set analysis that favors models similar to the $%
\Lambda CDM$ model by possibly mild fluctuations around the vacuum energy or
the cosmological constant, we extend the original Chaplygin Gas model (ECG) via
modifying the Chaplygin Gas equation of state by two parameters to describe an
entangled mixture state from an available matter and the rest component (which
can take the cosmological constant or dark energy as in the current cosmic
stage, or `curvature-like' term, or radiation component in the early epoch, as
various phases) coexistence. At low redshifts, the connection of the ECG model
and the Born-infeld field is set up. As paradigms, we use the data coming from
the recently released SNLS for the first year and also the famous 157 type Ia
supernova (Ia SNe) gold dataset to constrain the model parameters. The
restricted results demonstrate clearly how large the entangled degree or the
ratio between the energy density parameters of the two entangled phases being.
The fact that the ECG models are consistent with the observations of Ia SNe is
obtained through the redshift-luminosity distance diagram, hence the ECG can be
regarded possible candidates for mimicking the current speed-up expansion of
our universe.",2006-05-29T08:06:29Z
"The Spitzer c2d Survey of Nearby Dense Cores: III: Low Mass Star
  Formation in a Small Group, L1251B","We present a comprehensive study of a low-mass star-forming region,L1251B, at
wavelengths from the near-infrared to the millimeter. L1251B, where only one
protostar, IRAS 22376+7455, was known previously, is confirmed to be a small
group of protostars based on observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The
most luminous source of L1251B is located 5"" north of the IRAS position. A
near-infrared bipolar nebula, which is not associated with the brightest object
and is located at the southeast corner of L1251B, has been detected in the IRAC
bands. OVRO and SMA interferometric observations indicate that the brightest
source and the bipolar nebula source in the IRAC bands are deeply embedded disk
sources.Submillimeter continuum observations with single-dish telescopes and
the SMA interferometric observations suggest two possible prestellar objects
with very high column densities. Outside of the small group, many young stellar
object candidates have been detected over a larger region of 12' x 12'.
Extended emission to the east of L1251B has been detected at 850 micron; this
""east core"" may be a site for future star formation since no point source has
been detected with IRAC or MIPS. This region is therefore a possible example of
low-mass cluster formation, where a small group of pre- and protostellar
objects (L1251B) is currently forming, alongside a large starless core (the
east core).",2006-05-18T21:46:25Z
"Disk Winds, Jets, and Outflows: Theoretical and Computational
  Foundations","We review advances in the theoretical and computational studies of disk
winds, jets and outflows including: the connection between accretion and jets,
the launch of jets from magnetized disks, the coupled evolution of jets and
disks, the interaction of magnetized young stellar objects with their
surrounding disks and the relevance to outflows, and finally, the link between
jet formation and gravitational collapse. We also address the predictions that
the theory makes about jet kinematics, collimation, and rotation, that have
recently been confirmed by high spatial and spectral resolution observations.
Disk winds have a universal character that may account for jets and outflows
during the formation of massive stars as well as brown dwarfs.",2006-03-21T22:42:28Z
Photometric Redshifts in the IRAC Shallow Survey,"Accurate photometric redshifts are calculated for nearly 200,000 galaxies to
a 4.5 micron flux limit of ~13 uJy in the 8.5 deg^2 Spitzer/IRAC Shallow
survey. Using a hybrid photometric redshift algorithm incorporating both
neural-net and template-fitting techniques, calibrated with over 15,000
spectroscopic redshifts, a redshift accuracy of \sigma = 0.06(1+z) is achieved
for 95% of galaxies at 0<z<1.5. The accuracy is \sigma = 0.12(1+z) for 95% of
AGN at 0<z<3. Redshift probability functions, central to several ongoing
studies of the galaxy population, are computed for the full sample. We
demonstrate that these functions accurately represent the true redshift
probability density, allowing the calculation of valid confidence intervals for
all objects. These probability functions have already been used to successfully
identify a population of Spitzer-selected high redshift (z>1) galaxy clusters.
We present one such spectroscopically confirmed cluster at <z>=1.24, ISCS
J1434.5+3427. Finally, we present a measurement of the 4.5 micron-selected
galaxy redshift distribution.",2006-07-19T21:16:39Z
"Magnetohydronamic Evolution of HII Regions in Molecular Clouds:
  Simulation Methodology, Tests, and Uniform Media","We present a method for simulating the evolution of HII regions driven by
point sources of ionizing radiation in magnetohydrodynamic media, implemented
in the three-dimensional Athena MHD code. We compare simulations using our
algorithm to analytic solutions and show that the method passes rigorous tests
of accuracy and convergence. The tests reveal several conditions that an
ionizing radiation-hydrodynamic code must satisfy to reproduce analytic
solutions. As a demonstration of our new method, we present the first
three-dimensional, global simulation of an HII region expanding into a
magnetized gas. The simulation shows that magnetic fields suppress sweeping up
of gas perpendicular to magnetic field lines, leading to small density
contrasts and extremely weak shocks at the leading edge of the HII region's
expanding shell.",2006-06-21T21:08:40Z
Noncommutative chaotic inflation and WMAP three year results,"Noncommutative inflation is based upon the consideration of some effects of
the space-time uncertainty principle motivated by ideas from string/M theory.
The CMB anisotropies may carry a signature of this very early Universe
correction from the space-time uncertainty principle and can be used to place
constraints on the parameters of the noncommutative inflation model. In this
paper we analyze the noncommutative chaotic inflation model by means of the
WMAP three year results. We show that the noncommutative chaotic inflation
model can produce a large negative running of spectral index within a
reasonable range of $e$-folding number $N$, provided that the value of $p$ in
the potential $V(\phi)\propto \phi^p$ is enhanced roughly to $p\sim 12-18$.
Applying a likelihood analysis to the WMAP results, we find the best-fit values
of parameters for the noncommutative chaotic inflation model. In addition, this
model predicts a rather big gravitational wave which may be tested by the
upcoming experiments.",2006-04-10T09:02:57Z
"Coherent Active-Sterile Neutrino Flavor Transformation in the Early
  Universe","We solve the problem of coherent Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) resonant
active-to-sterile neutrino flavor conversion driven by an initial lepton number
in the early universe. We find incomplete destruction of lepton number in this
process and a sterile neutrino energy distribution with a distinctive cusp and
high energy tail. These features imply alteration of the non-zero lepton number
primordial nucleosynthesis paradigm when there exist sterile neutrinos with
rest masses ~ 1 eV. This could result in better light element probes of
(constraints on) these particles.",2006-07-18T00:17:36Z
"Magnetic fields in our Galaxy: How much do we know? III. Progress in the
  last decade","A decade ago, there was very limited knowledge of magnetic fields of our
Galaxy. The local fields in the Solar vicinity were known to be directed
towards a Galactic longitude $l\sim~90^{\circ}$ with reversed directions at
smaller Galacto-radii. The regular field strength was found to be about
2~$\mu$G. The filaments near the Galactic Center show the possible poloidal
fields there. There was no information about the magnetic fields in the
Galactic halo. In last decade, there has been significant progress on
measurements of the Galactic magnetic fields. In the Galactic disk, from the
RMs of a large number of newly observed pulsars, large-scale magnetic fields
along the spiral arms have been delineated in a much larger region then ever
before, with alternating directions in the arm and interarm regions. The
toroidal fields in the Galactic halo were revealed to have opposite directions
below and above the Galactic plane, which is an indication of A0 dynamo
operating in the halo. The strength of large-scale fields also has been found
from pulsar RM data to exponentially increase at smaller Galacto-radii.
Compared to the steep Kolmogorov spectrum of magnetic energy at small scales,
the large-scale magnetic fields show a shallow broken spatial magnetic energy
spectrum.",2006-03-19T12:02:19Z
Primordial gas cooling behind shock waves in merging halos,"We investigate thermal regime of the baryons behind shock waves arising in
the process of virialization of dark matter halos. We find a fraction of the
shocked gas cooled by radiation of HD molecules down to the temperature of the
cosmic microwave background (CMB): this fraction increases sharply from about
$f_{\rm c}\sim 10^{-3}$ for dark halos of $M=5\times 10^7\msun$ to $\sim 0.1$
for halos with $M=10^8\msun$ at $z=10$. We show, however, that further increase
of the mass does not lead to a significant growth of $f_{\rm c}$ -- the
assymptotic value for $M\gg 10^8\msun$ is of 0.2. We estimate star formation
rate associated with such shock waves, and show that it can be a small but not
negligible fraction of the star formation connected with cooling by HI and
H$_2$. We argue that extremely metal-poor low-mass stars in the Milky Way may
have been formed from primordial gas behind such shocks.",2006-04-19T09:36:27Z
Terrestrial Planet Formation Surrounding Close Binary Stars,"Disk material has been observed around both components of some young close
binary star systems. It has been shown that if planets form at the right places
within such disks, they can remain dynamically stable for very long times.
Herein, we numerically simulate the late stages of terrestrial planet growth in
circumbinary disks around 'close' binary star systems with stellar separations
between 0.05 AU and 0.4 AU and binary eccentricities up to 0.8. In each
simulation, the sum of the masses of the two stars is 1 solar mass, and giant
planets are included. Our results are statistically compared to a set of planet
formation simulations in the Sun-Jupiter-Saturn system that begin with
essentially the same initial disk of protoplanets. The planetary systems formed
around binaries with apastron distances less than ~ 0.2 AU are very similar to
those around single stars, whereas those with larger maximum separations tend
to be sparcer, with fewer planets, especially interior to 1 AU. We also provide
formulae that can be used to scale results of planetary accretion simulations
to various systems with different total stellar mass, disk sizes, and
planetesimal masses and densities.",2006-07-11T19:36:55Z
On the dynamical evolution of hot spots in powerful radio loud AGNs,"We describe the dynamical evolution of hot spots velocity, pressure and mass
density in radio loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs), taking proper account of
(1) the conservations of the mass, momentum, and kinetic energy flux of the
unshocked jet, (2) the deceleration process of the jet by shocks, and (3) the
cocoon expansion without assuming the constant aspect ratio of the cocoon. By
the detailed comparison with two dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic
simulations, we show that our model well reproduces the whole evolution of
relativistic jets. Our model can explain also the observational trends of the
velocity, the pressure, the size, and mass density of hot spots in compact
symmetric objects (CSOs) and FR II radio galaxies.",2006-05-19T06:20:13Z
Coincidence Problem in YM Field Dark Energy Model,"The coincidence problem is studied in the effective Yang-Mills condensate
dark energy model. As the effective YM Lagrangian is completely determined by
quantum field theory, there is no adjustable parameter in this model except the
energy scale, and the cosmic evolution only depends on the initial conditions.
For generic initial conditions with the YM condensate subdominant to the
radiation and matter, the model always has a tracking solution, the Universe
transits from matter-dominated into the dark energy dominated stage only
recently $z\sim 0. 3$, and evolve to the present state with $\Omega_{y}\sim
0.73$ and $\Omega_m\sim 0.27$.",2006-04-21T06:19:35Z
Investigating halo substructures with annual modulation signature,"Galaxy hierarchical formation theories, numerical simulations, the discovery
of the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy (SagDEG) in 1994 and more recent
investigations suggest that the dark halo of the Milky Way can have a rich
phenomenology containing non thermalized substructures. In the present
preliminary study, we investigate the case of the SagDEG (the best known
satellite galaxy in the Milky Way crossing the solar neighbourhood) analyzing
the consequences of its dark matter stream contribution to the galactic halo on
the basis of the DAMA/NaI annual modulation data. The present analysis is
restricted to some WIMP candidates and to some of the astrophysical, nuclear
and particle Physics scenarios. Other candidates such as e.g. the light bosonic
ones, we discussed elsewhere, and other non thermalized substructures are not
yet addressed here.",2006-04-13T14:00:48Z
"The superimposed photospheric and stellar wind variability of the O-type
  supergiant alpha Cam","(Abridged) We provide empirical constraints on the different physical
components that can act to yield temporal variability in predominantly or
partially wind-formed optical lines of luminous OB stars, and thus potentially
affect the reliable determination of fundamental parameters, including
mass-loss rates via clumped winds. Using time-series spectroscopy from epochs
spread over $\sim$ 4 years, a case study of the O9.5 supergiant $\alpha$ Cam is
presented. We demonstrate that the He I 5876 (2$^3$P$^0$--3$^3$D) line is an
important diagnostic for photospheric and wind variability in this star. The
optical line profiles of $\alpha$ Cam are affected by (i) deep-seated
fluctuations close to, or at, the photosphere, (ii) atmospheric velocity
gradients, and (iii) large-scale stellar wind structure. This study provides
new empirical perspectives on accurate line-synthesis modelling of stellar wind
signatures in massive luminous stars. Using a pure Halpha line-synthesis code
we interpret maximum changes in the red-ward and peak emission of $\alpha$ Cam
in terms of mass-loss rate differences in the range $\sim$ 5.1 $\times$
10$^{-6}$ to 6.5 $\times$ 10$^{-6}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. However, the models
generally fail to reproduce the morphology of blueward (possibly absorptive)
regions of the profiles.",2006-06-29T13:15:48Z
"Beyond the bubble catastrophe of Type Ia supernovae: Pulsating Reverse
  Detonation models","We describe a mechanism by which a failed deflagration of a
Chandrasekhar-mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf can turn into a successful
thermonuclear supernova explosion, without invoking an ad hoc high-density
deflagration-detonation transition. Following a pulsating phase, an accretion
shock develops above a core of 1 M_sun composed of carbon and oxygen, inducing
a converging detonation. A three-dimensional simulation of the explosion
produced a kinetic energy of 1.05E51 ergs and 0.70 M_sun of 56Ni, ejecting
scarcely 0.01 M_sun of C-O moving at low velocities. The mechanism works under
quite general conditions and is flexible enough to account for the diversity of
normal Type Ia supernovae. In given conditions the detonation might not occur,
which would reflect in peculiar signatures in the gamma and UV-wavelengths",2006-04-03T12:56:56Z
"Lyman Break Galaxies Under a Microscope: The Small Scale Dynamics and
  Mass of an Arc in the Cluster 1E0657-56","Using the near-infrared integral-field spectrograph SPIFFI on the VLT, we
have studied the spatially-resolved dynamics in the z=3.2 strongly lensed
galaxy 1E0657-56 ``arc+core''. The lensing configuration suggests that the high
surface brightness ``core'' is the M=20 magnified central 1 kpc of the galaxy
(seen at a spatial resolution of about 200 pc in the source plane), whereas the
fainter ``arc'' is a more strongly magnified peripheral region of the same
galaxy at about a half-light radius, which otherwise appears to be a typical
z=3 Lyman break galaxy.
  The overall shape of the position-velocity diagram resembles the ``rotation
curves'' of the inner few kpcs of nearby L* spiral galaxies. The projected
velocities rise rapidly to 75 km/s within the core. This implies a dynamical
mass of M_dyn = 10^9.3 M_sun within the central kpc, and suggests that in this
system the equivalent of the mass of a present-day L* bulge at the same radius
was already in place by z>=3. Approximating the circular velocity of the halo
by the measured asymptotic velocity of the rotation curve, we estimate a dark
matter halo mass of M_halo = 10^11.7 +/- 0.3, in good agreement with
large-scale clustering studies of Lyman break galaxies. The baryonic collapse
fraction is low compared to actively star-forming ``BX'' and low-redshift
galaxies around z=2, perhaps implying comparatively less gas infall to small
radii or efficient feedback. Even more speculatively, the high central mass
density might indicate highly dissipative gas collapse in very early stages of
galaxy evolution, in approximate agreement with what is expected for
``inside-out'' galaxy formation models.",2006-06-21T16:20:30Z
Cosmological Evolution of the Duty Cycle of Quasars,"Quasars are powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes, but the
problem of the duty cycle related to the episodic activity of the black holes
remains open as one of the major questions of cosmological evolution of
quasars. In this Letter, we obtain quasar duty cycles based on analyses of a
large sample composed of 10,979 quasars with redshifts $z\le2.1$ from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release Three. We estimate masses of quasar
black holes and obtain their mass function (MF) of the present sample. We then
get the duty cycle $\bar{\delta}(z)=10^{-3}\sim 1$ based on the So{\l}tan's
argument, implying that black holes are undergoing multiple episodic activity.
We find that the duty cycle has a strong evolution. By comparison, we show that
evolution of the duty cycle follows the history of cosmic star formation rate
(SFR) density in the Universe, providing intriguing evidence for a natural
connection between star formation and triggering of black hole activity.
Feedback on star formation from black hole activity is briefly discussed.",2006-06-28T23:42:40Z
"3D spectroscopy with VLT/GIRAFFE - III: Mapping electron densities in
  distant galaxies","We used the moderately high spectral resolution of FLAMES/GIRAFFE (R=10000)
to derive electron densities from [OII] line ratios in 6 galaxies at z~0.55.
These measurements have been done through the GIRAFFE multiple integral field
units and are the very first mapping of electron densities in such distant
objects. This allows us to confirm an outflow and identify the role of giant
HII regions in galactic disks. Such measurements could be used in the future to
investigate the nature of the physical processes responsible for the high star
formations rates observed in galaxies between z~0.4 and z~1.",2006-03-21T12:31:09Z
The z=3 QSO Luminosity Function with SWIRE,"We use a simple optical/infrared photometric selection of high redshift QSOs
which identifies a Lyman Break in the optical and requires a red IRAC color to
distinguish QSOs from common interlopers. We find 100 U-dropout (z=3) QSO
candidates with r'<22 within 11.2 deg^2 in the ELAIS-N1 & ELAIS-N2 fields in
the Spitzer Wide-Area Infrared Extragalactic (SWIRE) Legacy Survey.
Spectroscopy of 10 candidates shows that they are all QSOs with 2.83<z<3.44. We
use detailed simulations which incorporate variations in QSO SEDs, IGM
transmission and imaging depth to derive a completeness of 85-90% between
3.0<z<3.4. The resulting luminosity function is two magnitudes fainter than
SDSS and, when combined with those data, gives a faint end slop \beta = 1.62
\pm 0.18, consistent with measurements at z<2 and steeper than initial
measurements at the same redshift.",2006-04-18T07:13:25Z
Fossil Biodiversity: Red Noise Plus Signal,"We have examined the Fourier power spectrum as well as the Hurst exponent of
extinction, origination, and total biodiversity in the marine fossil record,
using a recently improved geologic timescale. We find all of them strongly
inconsistent with past claims of self-similarity as well as inconsistent with
random walk behavior. Instead, they are dominated by low-frequency power, with
approximate f^-2 power over one decade in frequency. The spectrum turns over at
about 10^8 y, lending plausibility to connections with galactic dynamics. Even
in the background of this low-frequency dominance, a previously noted 62 My
biodiversity cycle stands out with better than 99% confidence above the noise
level, accounting for about 35% of the total variance in the fossil
biodiversity record.",2006-06-13T19:38:53Z
"The Polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background Due to Primordial
  Gravitational Waves","We review current observational constraints on the polarization of the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB), with a particular emphasis on detecting the
signature of primordial gravitational waves. We present an analytic solution to
the Polanarev approximation for CMB polarization produced by primordial
gravitational waves. This simplifies the calculation of the curl, or B-mode
power spectrum associated with gravitational waves during the epoch of
cosmological inflation. We compare our analytic method to existing numerical
methods and also make predictions for the sensitivity of upcoming CMB
polarization observations to the inflationary gravitational wave background. We
show that upcoming experiments should be able either detect the relic
gravitational wave background or completely rule out whole classes of
inflationary models.",2006-07-10T22:45:52Z
"Chandra Observations of Candidate ""True"" Seyfert 2 Nuclei","The Unification Model for active galactic nuclei posits that Seyfert 2s are
intrinsically like Seyfert 1s, but that their broad-line regions (BLRs) are
hidden from our view. A Seyfert 2 nucleus that truly lacked a BLR, instead of
simply having it hidden, would be a so-called ""true"" Seyfert 2. No object has
as yet been conclusively proven to be one. We present a detailed analysis of
four of the best ""true"" Seyfert 2 candidates discovered to date: IC 3639, NGC
3982, NGC 5283, and NGC 5427. None of the four has a broad H-alpha emission
line, either in direct or polarized light. All four have rich, high-excitation
spectra, blue continua, and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images showing them to
be unresolved sources with no host-galaxy obscuration. To check for possible
obscuration on scales smaller than that resolvable by HST, we obtained X-ray
observations using the Chandra X-ray Observatory. All four objects show
evidence of obscuration and therefore could have hidden BLRs. The picture that
emerges is of moderate to high, but not necessarily Compton-thick, obscuration
of the nucleus, with extra-nuclear soft emission extended on the
hundreds-of-parsecs scale that may originate in the narrow-line region. Since
the extended soft emission compensates, in part, for the nuclear soft emission
lost to absorption, both absorption and luminosity are likely to be severely
underestimated unless the X-ray spectrum is of sufficient quality to
distinguish the two components. This is of special concern where the source is
too faint to produce a large number of counts, or where the source is too far
away to resolve the extended soft X-ray emitting region.",2006-06-20T18:06:08Z
Probable detection of H2D+ in the starless core Barnard 68,"The presence of H2D+ in dense cloud cores underlies ion-molecule reactions
that strongly enhance the deuterium fractionation of many molecular species. We
determine the H2D+ abundance in one starless core, Barnard 68, that has a
particularly well established physical, chemical, and dynamical structure. We
observed the ortho-H2D+ ground-state line 1_10-1_11, the N2H+ J=4-3 line, and
the H13CO+ 4-3 line with the APEX telescope. We report the probable detection
of the o-H2D+ line at an intensity Tmb=0.22 +- 0.08 K and exclusively thermal
line width, and find only upper limits to the N2H+ 4-3 and H13CO+ 4-3
intensities. Within the uncertainties in the chemical reaction rates and the
collisional excitation rates, chemical model calculations and excitation
simulations reproduce the observed intensities and that of o-H2D+ in
particular.",2006-05-22T12:33:49Z
Instruments without optics: an integrated photonic spectrograph,"In recent years, a great deal of emphasis has been placed on achieving the
diffraction limit with large aperture telescopes. For a well matched
focal-plane instrument, the diffraction limit provides the highest possible
angular resolution and sensitivity per pixel. But it offers another key
advantage as we now show. Conventionally, as the telescope aperture D grows,
the instrument size grows in proportion to D, and cost increases as D^2 or
faster. However, an instrument that operates at the diffraction limit can break
the trend of spiralling costs. In traditional instruments, the light must pass
through a succession of large lenses, mirrors and gratings, making it difficult
to conserve the integrity of such as small psf. An alternative approach, as we
now show, is to couple the diffraction limited beam directly into an integrated
photonic spectrograph operating in low-order modes.",2006-06-13T02:04:10Z
"The discovery of an expanding X-ray source in the HH 154 protostellar
  jet","We have performed, in October 2005, a deep Chandra X-ray observation of HH
154. Comparison with the previous (2001) Chandra observation allows to detect
proper motion down to the level predicted by models of X-ray emitting shocks in
the jet. The 2005 Chandra observation of HH 154 shows unexpected morphological
changes of the X-ray emission in comparison with the 2001 data. Two components
are present: a stronger, point-like component with no detectable motion and a
weaker component which has expanded in size by approximately 300 AU over the 4
years time base of the two observations. This expansion corresponds to
approximately 500 km/s, very close to the velocity of the X-ray emitting shock
in the simple theoretical models. The 2005 data show a more complex system than
initially thought (and modeled), with multiple components with different
properties. The observed morphology is possibly indicating a pulsed jet
propagating through a non-homogeneous medium, likely with medium density
decreasing with distance from the driving source. Detailed theoretical modeling
and deeper X-ray observations will be needed to understand the physics of this
fascinating class of sources.",2006-03-08T09:55:33Z
"The nature of the close magnetic white dwarf + probable brown dwarf
  binary SDSS J121209.31+013627.7","Optical time series photometry of the short period magnetic white dwarf +
probable brown dwarf binary SDSS 121209.31+013627.7 reveals pulse-like
variability in all bands from i' to u', peaking at u'. These modulations are
most likely due to a self-eclipsing accretion hot spot on the white dwarf,
rotating into view every 88.43 minutes. This period is commensurate with the
radial velocity period determined by Schmidt et al. 2005 of ~90 minutes, and
consistent with the rotation period of the accretor being equal to the binary
orbital period. We combine our observations with those recently published by
Koen and Maxted 2006 to provide an accurate ephemeris. We also detect the
system in X-rays with Swift, and estimate the accretion rate at ~1x10^-13Msun
per year. We suggest that SDSS1212 is most likely a magnetic cataclysmic
variable in an extended state of very low accretion, similar to the
well-studied Polar EF Eri. Alternatively, the putative brown dwarf is not
filling its Roche Lobe and the system is a detached binary in which the white
dwarf is efficiently accreting from the wind of the secondary. Six such
post-common envelope, ``pre-Polar'' systems - termed ``low accretion rate
Polars (LARPs)'' by Schwope et al. 2002 - have previously been identified
through optical cyclotron emission lines. Cyclotron emission from SDSS1212 has
recently been detected in the near-IR Debes et al. 2006 but, if detached, it
would be the first ``LARP'' with a probably sub-stellar secondary. It is
unclear whether an L-dwarf wind is strong enough to provide the measured
accretion rate. We suggest further observations to distinguish between the
Roche Lobe over-flow and wind accretion scenarios.",2006-07-17T16:06:16Z
"Star Formation History of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field: Comparison with
  the HDFN","We use the NICMOS Treasury and ACS HUDF images to measure the extinction
corrected star formation history for 4681 galaxies in the region common to both
images utilizing the star formation rate distribution function and other
techniques similar to those employed with the NICMOS and WFPC2 images in the
HDFN. Unlike the HDFN the NICMOS region of the HUDF appears to lack highly
luminous and high star formation rate galaxies at redshifts beyond 3. The HUDF
provides a region that is completely uncorrelated to the HDFN and therefore
provides and independent measure of the star formation history of the universe.
The combined HUDF and HDFN star formation rates show an average star formation
rate of 0.2 solar masses per yer per cubic megaparsec. The average SFR of the
combined fields at z = 1-3 is 0.29 solar masses per year per cubic megaparsec
while the average at z = 4-6 is 1.2 solar masses per year per cubic megaparsec.
The SFRs at all redshifts are within 3 sigma of the average over all redshifts.",2006-05-02T17:03:56Z
"The mean electro-motive force, current- and cross-helicity under the
  influence of rotation, magnetic field and shear","The mean electromotive force (MEMF) in a rotating stratified
magnetohydrodynamical turbulence is studied.Our study rests on the mean-field
magnetohydrodynamics framework and $\tau$ approximation. We compute the effects
of the large-scale magnetic fields (LSMF), global rotation and large-scale
shear flow on the different parts of the MEMF (such as $\alpha$ - effect,
turbulent diffusion, turbulent transport, etc.) in an explicit form. The
influence of the helical magnetic fluctuations which stem from the small-scale
dynamo is taken into account, as well. In the paper, we derive the equation
governing the current helicity evolution. It is shown that the joint effect of
the differential rotation and magnetic fluctuations in the stratified media can
be responsible for the generation, maintenance and redistribution of the
current helicity. The implication of the obtained results to astrophysical
dynamos is considered as well.",2006-06-12T10:19:51Z
Orbital Evolution of Algol Binaries with a Circumbinary Disk,"It is generally thought that conservative mass transfer in Algol binaries
causes their orbits to be wider, in which the less massive star overflows its
Roche-lobe. The observed decrease in the orbital periods of some Algol binaries
suggests orbital angular momentum loss during the binary evolution, and the
magnetic braking mechanism is often invoked to explain the observed orbital
shrinkage. Here we suggest an alternative explanation, assuming that a small
fraction of the transferred mass forms a circumbinary disk, which extracts
orbital angular momentum from the binary through tidal torques. We also perform
numerical calculations of the evolution of Algol binaries with typical initial
masses and orbital periods. The results indicate that, for reasonable input
parameters, the circumbinary disk can significantly influence the orbital
evolution, and cause the orbit to shrink on a sufficiently long timescale.
Rapid mass transfer in Algol binaries with low mass ratios can also be
accounted for in this scenario.",2006-06-05T03:55:12Z
"Massive Star Cluster Populations in Irregulars as Probable Younger
  Counterparts of Old Metal-Rich Globular Cluster Populations in Spheroids","Peak metallicities of metal-rich(MR) populations of GCs belonging to
spheroids of different mass fall within the somewhat conservative
-0.7<=[Fe/H]<=-0.3 range. Indeed, if possible age effects are taken into
account,this metallicity range might become smaller. Irregulars, like the LMC,
with longer timescales of their formation and lower star formation (SF)
efficiency do not contain the old MRGCs with [Fe/H]>-1.0,but they are observed
to form populations of young/ intermediate-age massive star clusters (MSCs)
with masses exceeding 10^4 Msol. Their formation is widely believed to be
accidental process fully depending on external factors. From analysis of data
available on the populations and their hosts, including populous star clusters
in the LMC, we find that their most probable mean metallicities fall within
-0.7<=[Fe/H]<=-0.3, as the peak metallicities of MRGCs do, irrespective of
sings of interaction. Moreover, both the disk giant metallicity distribution
function (MDF) in the LMC and the MDFs for old giants in the halos of massive
spheroids exhibit significant increasing toward [Fe/H]~-0.5. That is in
agreement with a correlation found between SF activity in galaxies and their
metallicity. The formation of both the old MRGCs in spheroids and MSC
populations in irregulars probably occurs approximately at the same stage of
the host galaxies' chemical evolution and is related to the essentially
increased SF activity in the hosts around the same metallicity that is achieved
very soon in massive spheroids, later in lower-mass spheroids, and much more
later in irregulars. (Abridged)",2006-05-23T17:15:22Z
Chandra and XMM-Newton Observations of a Group of Galaxies HCG 62,"We present results from Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of the bright
group of galaxies HCG 62. There are two cavities at about 30'' northeast and
20'' southwest of the central galaxy in the Chandra image. The energy spectrum
shows no significant change in the cavity compared with that in the surrounding
region. The radial X-ray profile is described by a sum of 3-beta components
with core radii about 2, 10, and 160 kpc, respectively. We studied radial
distributions of temperature and metal abundance with joint spectral fit for
the Chandra and XMM-Newton data, and two temperatures were required in the
inner r< 2' (35 kpc) region. The sharp drop of temperature at r about 5'
implies the gravitational mass density even lower than the gas density,
suggesting the gas may not be in hydrostatic equilibrium. Fe and Si abundances
are 1-2 solar at the center and drop to about 0.1 solar at r about 10'. O
abundance is less than 0.5 solar and shows a flatter profile. Observed metal
distribution supports the view that iron and silicon are produced by type Ia
supernova in the central galaxy, while galactic winds by type II supernova have
caused wide distribution of oxygen. The supporting mechanism of the cavity is
discussed. Pressure for the sum of electrons and magnetic field is too low to
displace the hot group gas, and the required pressure due to high energy
protons are nearly 700 times higher than the electron pressure. This leaves the
origin of the cavities a puzzle, and we discuss other possible origins of the
cavities.",2006-07-08T08:57:00Z
"Detection regimes of the cosmological gravitational wave background from
  astrophysical sources","Key targets for gravitational wave (GW) observatories, such as LIGO and the
next generation interferometric detector, Advanced LIGO, include core-collapse
of massive stars and the final stage of coalescence of compact stellar
remnants. The combined GW signal from such events occurring throughout the
Universe will produce an astrophysical GW background (AGB), one that is
fundamentally different from the GW background by very early Universe
processes. One can classify contributions to the AGB for different classes of
sources based on the strength of the GW emissions from the individual sources,
their peak emission frequency, emission duration and their event rate density
distribution. This article provides an overview of the detectability regimes of
the AGB in the context of current and planned gravitational wave observatories.
We show that there are two important AGB signal detection regimes, which we
define as `continuous' and `popcorn noise'. We describe how the `popcorn noise'
AGB regime evolves with observation time and we discuss how this feature
distinguishes it from the GW background produced from very early Universe
processes.",2006-07-04T08:36:40Z
Inflation is the generic feature of phantom field-not the big-rip,"A class of solutions for phantom field corresponding to a generalized
k-essence lagrangian has been presented, employing a simple method which
provides the scope to explore many such. All the solutions having dynamical
state parameter are found to touch the magic line w = -1, asymptotically. The
solutions with constant equation of state can represent phantom, quitessence or
an ordinary scalar field cosmologies depending on the choice of a couple of
parameters of the theory. For w approximately equal to -1, quintessence and
phantom models are indistinguishable through the Hubble parameter. Finally,
inflation rather than big-rip has been found to be the generic feature of
phantom cosmology.",2006-05-16T13:48:45Z
New Pulsating White Dwarfs in Cataclysmic Variables,"The number of discovered non-radially pulsating white dwarfs (WDs) in
cataclysmic variables (CVs) is increasing rapidly by the aid of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We performed photometric observations of two
additional objects, SDSS J133941.11+484727.5 (SDSS 1339), independently
discovered as a pulsator by Gansicke et al., and SDSS J151413.72+454911.9,
which we identified as a CV/ZZ Ceti hybrid. In this Letter we present the
results of the remote observations of these targets performed with the Nordic
Optical Telescope (NOT) during the Nordic-Baltic Research School at Moletai
Observatory, and follow-up observations executed by NOT in service mode. We
also present 3 candidates we found to be non-pulsating. The results of our
observations show that the main pulsation frequencies agree with those found in
previous CV/ZZ Ceti hybrids, but specifically for SDSS 1339 the principal
period differs slightly between individual observations and also from the
recent independent observation by Gansicke et al. Analysis of SDSS colour data
for the small sample of pulsating and non-pulsating CV/ZZ Ceti hybrids found so
far, seems to indicate that the r-i colour could be a good marker for the
instability strip of this class of pulsating WDs.",2006-05-22T11:27:36Z
"Broad H-alpha wings from the optically thin stellar wind of the hot
  components in symbiotic binaries","Aims: To model broad H-alpha wings observed in symbiotic binaries by an
optically thin, bipolar stellar wind from their hot components as an
alternative to that considering the Raman scattering of Ly-beta photons on
atomic hydrogen. Methods: Profile-fitting analysis. Comparison of the observed
broad H-alpha wings and their luminosity with those predicted by the model.
Results: Synthetic H-alpha profiles fit excellently the observed wings for |RV|
> 200 km/s in our sample of 10 symbiotic stars during the quiescent as well as
active phases. The wing profile formed in the stellar wind can be approximated
by a function f(RV) proportional to RVexp-2, which is of the same type as that
arising from the Raman scattering. Therefore it is not possible to distinguish
between these two processes only by modeling the line profile. Some
observational characteristics of the H-alpha emission suggest the ionized
stellar wind from the hot component to be the dominant source contributing to
the H-alpha wings during active phases. The model corresponding mass-loss rates
from the hot components are of a few x 10exp(-8) M(Sun)/yr and of a few x
(10exp(-7) - 10exp(-6)) M(Sun)/yr during quiescent and active phases,
respectively.",2006-07-20T08:14:55Z
"Energy input and response from prompt and early optical afterglow
  emission in gamma-ray bursts","The taxonomy of optical emission detected during the critical first few
minutes after the onset of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) defines two broad classes:
prompt optical emission correlated with prompt gamma-ray emission, and early
optical afterglow emission uncorrelated with the gamma-ray emission. The
standard theoretical interpretation attributes prompt emission to internal
shocks in the ultra-relativistic outflow generated by the internal engine;
early afterglow emission is attributed to shocks generated by interaction with
the surrounding medium. Here we report on observations of a bright GRB that,
for the first time, clearly show the temporal relationship and relative
strength of the two optical components. The observations indicate that early
afterglow emission can be understood as reverberation of the energy input
measured by prompt emission. Measurements of the early afterglow reverberations
therefore probe the structure of the environment around the burst, whereas the
subsequent response to late-time impulsive energy releases reveals how earlier
flaring episodes have altered the jet and environment parameters. Many GRBs are
generated by the death of massive stars that were born and died before the
Universe was ten per cent of its current age, so GRB afterglow reverberations
provide clues about the environments around some of the first stars.",2006-05-18T20:40:40Z
Isolated galaxies: residual of primordial building blocks?,"CONTEXT.The mass assembly is believed to be the dominant process of early
galaxy formation. This mechanism of galaxy building can proceed either by
repeated major mergers with other systems, or by means of accretion of matter
from the surrounding regions. AIMS.In this paper we compare the properties of
local disk galaxies that appear isolated, i.e. not tidally affected by other
galaxies during the last few Gyr within the volume given by cz<= 5000 km/s,
with those galaxies at z values from 0.25 to 5.
  METHODS.Effective radii for 203 isolated galaxies and 1645 galaxies from the
RC3 have been collected and the two samples have been analyzed statistically. A
similar comparison has been made with half light radii studied at high z from
the literature.
  RESULTS.We found that isolated galaxies are in general smaller than other
present epoch galaxies from the RC3. We notice the lack of systems larger than
7 kpc among them. Their size distribution appears to be similar to that of
galaxies at 1.4 <= z <= 2. The models of the merging history also indicate that
the isolated galaxies did stop their merging process at about that redshift,
evolving passively since then. The galaxy density seems to have remained
unchanged since that epoch.
  CONCLUSIONS.Isolated galaxies appears to be the end products of the merging
process as proposed in the hierarchical accretion scenario at around z=1.4. For
this class of galaxies this was the last significant merging event in their
lives and have evolved passively since then. This is confirmed by the
analytical estimate of the merging fraction with z and by the comparison with
sizes of distant galaxies.",2006-05-03T17:08:07Z
"Collisional Ionization Equilibrium for Optically Thin Plasmas. I.
  Updated Recombination Rate Coefficients for Bare though Sodium-like Ions","Reliably interpreting spectra from electron-ionized cosmic plasmas requires
accurate ionization balance calculations for the plasma in question. However,
much of the atomic data needed for these calculations have not been generated
using modern theoretical methods and are often highly suspect. This translates
directly into the reliability of the collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE)
calculations. We make use of state-of-the-art calculations of dielectronic
recombination (DR) rate coefficients for the hydrogenic through Na-like ions of
all elements from He up to and including Zn. We also make use of
state-of-the-art radiative recombination (RR) rate coefficient calculations for
the bare through Na-like ions of all elements from H through to Zn. Here we
present improved CIE calculations for temperatures from $10^4$ to $10^9$ K
using our data and the recommended electron impact ionization data of
\citet{Mazz98a} for elements up to and including Ni and Mazzotta (private
communication) for Cu and Zn. DR and RR data for ionization stages that have
not been updated are also taken from these two additional sources. We compare
our calculated fractional ionic abundances using these data with those
presented by Mazzotta et al. for all elements from H to Ni. The differences in
peak fractional abundance are up to 60%. We also compare with the fractional
ionic abundances for Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca, Fe, and Ni derived from the modern DR
calculations of \citet{Gu03a,Gu04a} for the H-like through Na-like ions, and
the RR calculations of \citet{Gu03b} for the bare through F-like ions. These
results are in better agreement with our work, with differences in peak
fractional abundance of less than 10%.",2006-04-17T21:57:47Z
Low Mach Number Modeling of Type Ia Supernovae. II. Energy Evolution,"The convective period leading up to a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) explosion is
characterized by very low Mach number flows, requiring hydrodynamical methods
well-suited to long-time integration. We continue the development of the low
Mach number equation set for stellar scale flows by incorporating the effects
of heat release due to external sources. Low Mach number hydrodynamics
equations with a time-dependent background state are derived, and a numerical
method based on the approximate projection formalism is presented. We
demonstrate through validation with a fully compressible hydrodynamics code
that this low Mach number model accurately captures the expansion of the
stellar atmosphere as well as the local dynamics due to external heat sources.
This algorithm provides the basis for an efficient simulation tool for studying
the ignition of SNe Ia.",2006-06-21T16:52:08Z
A neutron-star-driven X-ray flash associated with supernova SN 2006aj,"Supernovae connected with long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are
hyper-energetic explosion resulting from the collapse of very massive stars
(about 40Mo, where Mo is the mass of the Sun) stripped of their outher hydrogen
and helium envelopes. A very massive progenitor, collapsing to a black hole,
was thought to be a requirement for the launch of a GRB. Here we report the
results of modelling the spectra and light curve of SN 2006aj, which
demonstrate that the supernova had a much smaller explosion energy and ejected
much less mass than the other GRB-sueprnovae, suggesting that it was produced
by a star whose initial mass was only about 20Mo. A star of this mass is
expected to form a neutron star rather than a black hole when its core
collapses. The smaller explosion energy of SN 2006aj is matched by the weakness
and softness of GRB 060218 (an X-ray flash), and the weakness of the radio flux
of the supernova. Our results indicate that the supernova-GRB connection
extends to a much broader range of stellar masses than previously thought,
possibly involving different physical mechanisms: a `collapsar' for the more
massive stars collapsing to a black hole, and magnetic activity of the nascent
neutron star for the less massive stars.",2006-03-21T14:41:43Z
"Interferometric Observations of Explosive Variables: V838 Mon, Nova Aql

months after its eruption, and were able to resolve the ejecta. Observations of
V1663 Aql were obtained starting 9 days after peak brightness and continued for
10 days. We were able to resolve the milliarcsecond-scale emission and follow
the expansion of the nova photosphere. When combined with radial-velocity

"Early structure formation in quintessence models and its implications
  for cosmic reionisation from first stars","We present the first hydrodynamic N-body simulations of primordial gas clouds
responsible for the reionisation process in dark energy cosmologies. We compare
the cosmological constant scenario with a SUGRA quintessence model with marked
dynamics in order to highlight effects due to the different acceleration
histories imposed by the dark energy. We show that both the number density of
gas clouds and their clumpiness keep a record of the expansion rate during
evolution, similar to the non-linear dark matter profile at virialisation, as
was recently demonstrated by Dolag et al. (2004). Varying the shape of the
primordial power spectrum, we show how this effect is mitigated by a running
spectral index decreasing the power at small scales. Our results demonstrate
that, in order to constrain the dark energy from large scale structures, one
must track its effects down to the distribution of luminous matter.",2006-07-18T10:37:14Z
When Extrasolar Planets Transit Their Parent Stars,"When extrasolar planets are observed to transit their parent stars, we are
granted unprecedented access to their physical properties. It is only for
transiting planets that we are permitted direct estimates of the planetary
masses and radii, which provide the fundamental constraints on models of their
physical structure. In particular, precise determination of the radius may
indicate the presence (or absence) of a core of solid material, which in turn
would speak to the canonical formation model of gas accretion onto a core of
ice and rock embedded in a protoplanetary disk. Furthermore, the radii of
planets in close proximity to their stars are affected by tidal effects and the
intense stellar radiation. As a result, some of these ""hot Jupiters"" are
significantly larger than Jupiter in radius. Precision follow-up studies of
such objects (notably with the space-based platforms of the Hubble and Spitzer
Space Telescopes) have enabled direct observation of their transmission spectra
and emitted radiation. These data provide the first observational constraints
on atmospheric models of these extrasolar gas giants, and permit a direct
comparison with the gas giants of the Solar system. Despite significant
observational challenges, numerous transit surveys and quick-look radial
velocity surveys are active, and promise to deliver an ever-increasing number
of these precious objects. The detection of transits of short-period
Neptune-sized objects, whose existence was recently uncovered by the
radial-velocity surveys, is eagerly anticipated. Ultra-precise photometry
enabled by upcoming space missions offers the prospect of the first detection
of an extrasolar Earth-like planet in the habitable zone of its parent star,

GRB 060218/SN 2006aj: A Gamma-Ray Burst and Prompt Supernova at z=0.0335,"We report the imaging and spectroscopic localization of GRB 060218 to a
low-metallicity dwarf starburst galaxy at z = 0.03345 +/- 0.00006. In addition
to making it the second nearest gamma-ray burst known, optical spectroscopy
reveals the earliest detection of weak, supernova-like Si II near 5720
Angstroms (0.1c), starting 1.95 days after the burst trigger. UBVRI photometry
obtained between 1 and 26 days post-burst confirms the early rise of supernova
light, and suggests a short time delay between the gamma-ray burst and the
onset of SN 2006aj if the early appearance of a soft component in the X-ray
spectrum is understood as a ``shock breakout''. Together, these results verify
the long-hypothesized origin of soft gamma-ray bursts in the deaths of massive
stars.",2006-03-24T21:00:06Z
"Shock Breakout in Type Ibc Supernovae and Application to GRB 060218/SN
  2006aj","Recently, a soft black-body component was observed in the early X-ray
afterglow of GRB 060218, which was interpreted as shock breakout from the thick
wind of the progenitor Wolf-Rayet (WR) star of the underlying Type Ic SN
2006aj. In this paper we present a simple model for computing the
characteristic quantities (including energy, temperature, and time-duration)
for the transient event from the shock breakout in Type Ibc supernovae produced
by the core-collapse of WR stars surrounded by dense winds. In contrast to the
case of a star without a strong wind, the shock breakout occurs in the wind
region rather than inside the star, caused by the large optical depth in the
wind. We find that, for the case of a WR star with a dense wind, the total
energy of the radiation generated by the supernova shock breakout is larger
than that in the case of the same star without a wind by a factor > 10. The
temperature can be either hotter or cooler, depending on the wind parameters.
The time-duration is larger caused by the increase in the effective radius of
the star due to the presence of a thick wind. Then, we apply the model to GRB
060218/SN 2006aj. We show that, to explain both the temperature and the total
energy of the black-body component observed in GRB 060218 by the shock
breakout, the progenitor WR star has to have an unrealistically large core
radius (the radius at optical depth of 20), larger than 100 Rsun. In spite of
this disappointing result, our model is expected to have important applications
to the observations on Type Ibc supernovae in which the detection of shock
breakout will provide important clues to the progenitors of SNe Ibc.",2006-05-16T12:49:34Z
On the fraction of X-ray obscured quasars in the local universe,"Recent wide area hard X-ray and soft Gamma ray surveys have shown that the
fraction of X-ray obscured AGNs in the local universe significantly decreases
with intrinsic luminosity. In this letter we point out that two correction have
to be made to the samples: 1) radio loud AGNs have to be excluded since their
X-ray emission might be dominated by the jet component; 2) Compton thick
sources have to be excluded too since their hard X-ray and soft gamma ray
emission are also strongly attenuated by Compton scattering. The soft gamma-ray
selected AGN samples obtained by SWIFT and INTEGRAL provide the best
opportunity to study the fraction of obscured AGN in the local universe in the
least biased way. We choose these samples to check if the corrections could
alter the above result on the fraction of obscured AGNs. We find that before
the corrections both samples show significant anti-correlation between L_X and
N_H, indicating obvious decrease in the fraction of obscured AGNs with
luminosity. However, after the corrections, we find only marginal evidence of
anti-correlation (at 98% confidence level) in the SWIFT sample, and no evidence
at all in the INTEGRAL sample which consists of comparable number of objects.
We conclude that current samples only show a marginal decrease in the fraction
of obscured AGNs in the local universe, and much larger samples are required to
reach a more robust conclusion.",2006-06-14T01:10:12Z
"Orientation dependency of broad-line widths in quasars and consequences
  for black-hole mass estimation","In this paper we report new evidence that measurements of the broad-line
widths in quasars are dependent on the source orientation, consistent with the
idea that the broad-line region is flattened or disc-like. This reinforces the
view derived from radio-selected samples, where the radio-core dominance has
been used as a measure of orientation. The results presented here show a highly
significant (>99.95%) correlation between radio spectral index (which we use as
a proxy for source orientation) and broad-line width derived from the H-beta
and MgII emission lines. This is the first time that this type of study has
used quasars derived from a large optically selected quasar sample, where the
radio-loud quasars (RLQs) and radio-quiet quasars (RQQs) have indistinguishable
distributions in redshift, bolometric luminosity and colour, and therefore
overcomes any biases which may be present in only selecting via radio emission.
We find that the mean FWHM for the flat-spectrum radio-loud quasars (FSQs) to
be <FWHM(FSQ)>= 4990 +/- 536km/s, which differs significant from the mean FWHM
of the steep-spectrum radio-loud quasars (SSQs), where <FWHM(SSQ)>=6464 +/-
506km/s. We also find that the distribution in FWHM for the FSQs is
indistinguishable from that of the radio-quiet quasars (RQQs), where
<FWHM(RQQ)>= 4831 +/-25km/s. Considering other observational results in the
literature we interpret this result in the context of a significant fraction of
the FSQs being derived from the underlying RQQ population which have their
radio flux Doppler boosted above the RLQ/RQQ divide. Under the assumption of a
disc-like broad-line region we find no evidence for a difference in the average
line-of-sight angle for RQQs and RLQs, implying that the difference is due to
black-hole mass. (abridged)",2006-03-09T12:16:10Z
"Modelling galaxy clustering in a high resolution simulation of structure
  formation","We use the Millennium Simulation, a 10 billion particle simulation of the
growth of cosmic structure, to construct a new model of galaxy clustering. We
adopt a methodology that falls midway between the traditional semi-analytic
approach and the halo occupation distribution(HOD) approach. In our model, we
adopt the positions and velocities of the galaxies that are predicted by
following the orbits and merging histories of the substructures in the
simulation. Rather than using star formation and feedback `recipes' to specify
the physical properties of the galaxies, we adopt parametrized functions to
relate these properties to the quantity M_{infall}, defined as the mass of the
halo at the epoch when the galaxy was last the central dominant object in its
own halo. We test whether these parametrized relations allow us to recover the
basic statistical properties of galaxies in the semi-analytic catalogues,
including the luminosity function, the stellar mass function and the shape and
amplitude of the two-point correlation function evaluated in different stellar
mass and luminosity ranges. We then use our model to interpret recent
measurements of these quantities from Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. We derive
relations between the luminosities and the stellar masses of galaxies in the
local Universe and their host halo masses. Our results are in excellent
agreement with recent determinations of these relations by Mandelbaum et al
using galaxy-galaxy weak lensing measurements from the SDSS.",2006-03-20T21:02:29Z
Transient pulsed radio emission from a magnetar,"Anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) are slowly rotating neutron stars with very
bright and highly variable X-ray emission that are believed to be powered by
ultra-strong magnetic fields of >1e14 G, according to the 'magnetar' model. The
radio pulsations that have been observed from more than 1,700 neutron stars
with weaker magnetic fields have never been detected from any of the dozen
known magnetars. The X-ray pulsar XTE J1810-197 was revealed (in 2003) as the
first AXP with transient emission when its luminosity increased 100-fold from
the quiescent level; a coincident radio source of unknown origin was detected
one year later. Here we show that XTE J1810-197 emits bright, narrow, highly
linearly polarized radio pulses, observed at every rotation, thereby
establishing that magnetars can be radio pulsars. There is no evidence of radio
emission before the 2003 X-ray outburst (unlike ordinary pulsars, which emit
radio pulses all the time), and the flux varies from day to day. The flux at
all radio frequencies is approximately equal -- and at >20 GHz XTE J1810-197 is
currently the brightest neutron star known. These observations link magnetars
to ordinary radio pulsars, rule out alternative accretion models for AXPs, and
provide a new window into the coronae of magnetars.",2006-05-17T20:04:32Z
"An upper limit on anomalous dust emission at 31 GHz in the diffuse cloud
  [LPH96]201.663+1.643","[LPH96]201.663+1.643, a diffuse H{\sc ii} region, has been reported to be a
candidate for emission from rapidly spinning dust grains. Here we present
Cosmic Background Imager (CBI) observations at 26-36 GHz that show no evidence
for significant anomalous emission. The spectral index within the CBI band, and
between CBI and Effelsberg data at 1.4/2.7 GHz, is consistent with optically
thin free-free emission. The best-fitting temperature spectral index from 2.7
to 31 GHz, $\beta=-2.06 \pm 0.03$, is close to the theoretical value,
$\beta=-2.12$ for $T_{e}=9100$ K. We place an upper limit of 24% ~ (2\sigma)
for excess emission at 31 GHz as seen in a $6\arcmin$ FWHM beam. Current
spinning dust models are not a good fit to the spectrum of LPH96. No polarized
emission is detected in the CBI data with an upper limit of 2% on the
polarization fraction.",2006-03-06T20:49:56Z
On the migration of protogiant solid cores,"The increase of computational resources has recently allowed high resolution,
three dimensional calculations of planets embedded in gaseous protoplanetary
disks. They provide estimates of the planet migration timescale that can be
compared to analytical predictions. While these predictions can result in
extremely short migration timescales for cores of a few Earth masses, recent
numerical calculations have given an unexpected outcome: the torque acting on
planets with masses between 5 M_Earth and 20 M_Earth is considerably smaller
than the analytic, linear estimate. These findings motivated the present work,
which investigates existence and origin of this discrepancy or ``offset'', as
we shall call it, by means of two and three dimensional numerical calculations.
We show that the offset is indeed physical and arises from the coorbital
corotation torque, since (i) it scales with the disk vortensity gradient, (ii)
its asymptotic value depends on the disk viscosity, (iii) it is associated to
an excess of the horseshoe zone width. We show that the offset corresponds to
the onset of non-linearities of the flow around the planet, which alter the
streamline topology as the planet mass increases: at low mass the flow
non-linearities are confined to the planet's Bondi sphere whereas at larger
mass the streamlines display a classical picture reminiscent of the restricted
three body problem, with a prograde circumplanetary disk inside a ``Roche
lobe''. This behavior is of particular importance for the sub-critical solid
cores (M <~ 15 M_Earth) in thin (H/r <~0.06) protoplanetary disks. Their
migration could be significantly slowed down, or reversed, in disks with
shallow surface density profiles.",2006-07-07T21:07:46Z
Generating the primordial curvature perturbations in preheating,"We show that the primordial curvature perturbations may originate not from
the quantum fluctuations of inflaton during inflation but from isocurvature
perturbations which are amplified during preheating after inflation. We
consider a simple preheating model, whose potential is given by $V(\phi,
\chi)={1/4}\lambda \phi^4+{1/2}g^2 \phi^2 \chi^2$ with $g^2/\lambda=2$, as a
possible realization of generating curvature perturbations during preheating.
We make use of the $\delta N$ formalism which requires only knowledge of the
homogeneous background solutions in order to evaluate the evolution of
curvature perturbations on super-horizon scales. We solve the background
equations numerically and find that the amplitude and the spectral index of
curvature perturbations originating from preheating can be tuned to the
observed values if the isocurvature perturbations at the end of inflation is
not suppressed on super-horizon scales. We also point out that the tensor to
scalar ratio in ${1/4}\lambda \phi^4$ inflation model can be significantly
lowered, hence letting the ${1/4}\lambda \phi^4$ model, which is ruled out by
the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data combined with SDSS data,
get back into the observationally allowed region.",2006-06-09T13:46:15Z
A Universe Dominated by Dilaton Field,"Using a single dilaton field, a unified model of the Universe is proposed,
which evolves from the radiation-like dominance in the Big Bang, to the
dark-matter-like dominance in the early Universe, to the coexistence of both
dark-matter-like and dark energy today, and finally to the dark energy
dominance in the infinite future. This model is consistent with current results
on the age of the Universe, the transition redshift from deceleration to
acceleration, BBN and evolution of dark energy. Future higher quality data may
constrain the cosmic evolution of dark matter, dark energy and Hubble constant
more precisely and make critical tests on our model predictions.",2006-05-26T23:58:12Z
"Swift Observations of the highly X-ray variable Narrow Line Seyfert 1
  galaxy RX J0148.3-2758","We report on Swift observations of the Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy (NLS1) RX
J0148.3--2758. It was observed for 41.6 ks in 2005 May and for 15.8 ks in 2005
December. On short as well as on long timescales RX J0148.3--2758 is a highly
variable source. It doubles its X-ray flux within 18-25 ks. The observation of
2005 December 09, which had a flux 4 times lower than during the 2005 May
observations, shows a significant hardening of the X-ray hardness ratio
compared with the 2005-May and 2005-December 20/21 observations. A detailed
analysis of the X-ray spectra shows that we actually observe two spectral
changes in RX J0148.3-2758: First a decrease of the soft X-ray component
between 2005 May and December 09, which is most likely due to an increase of
the intrinsic absorber column, and second a decrease of the hard X-ray flux in
the December 20/21 observations. The soft X-ray spectral slope $\alpha_{\rm X,
soft}$=2.58$^{+0.15}_{-0.12}$ during the high state in 2005 May agrees well
with that measured by ROSAT (\axs=2.54\plm0.82). In contrast to the strong
X-ray variability, the analysis of the Swift UVOT photometry from December 2005
of RX J0148.3--2758 shows no significant variability in any of the 6 UVOT
filters. From the simultaneous X-ray and UV observations in 2005 December we
measured the X-ray loudness alpha-ox varies between alpha-ox=1.5 and 1.8. Our
Swift observations of RX J0148.3-2758 demonstrate the great potential the
multi-wavelength observatory Swift has for AGN science. (shortened)",2006-03-21T21:02:48Z
Proper motion of gamma-rays from microhalo sources,"I discuss the prospects of detecting the smallest dark matter bound
structures present in the Milky Way by searching for the proper motion of
$\gamma$-ray sources in the upcoming GLAST all sky map. I show that for dark
matter particle candidates that couple to photons the detection of at least one
$\gamma$-ray microhalo source with proper motion places a constraint on the
couplings and mass of the dark matter particle. For SUSY dark matter, proper
motion detection implies that the mass of the particle is less than 500 GeV and
the kinetic decoupling temperature is in the range of [4-100] MeV.",2006-06-08T20:51:09Z
"Lensing Effects on Gravitational Waves in a Clumpy Universe -Effects of
  Inhomogeneity on the Distance-Redshift Relation-","The distance-redshift relation determined by means of gravitational waves in
the clumpy universe is simulated numerically by taking into account the effects
of gravitational lensing. It is assumed that all of the matter in the universe
takes the form of randomly distributed point masses, each of which has the
identical mass $M_L$. Calculations are carried out in two extreme cases:
$\lambda\gg GM_L/c^2$ and $\lambda\ll GM_L/c^2$, where $\lambda$ denotes the
wavelength of gravitational waves. In the first case, the distance-redshift
relation for the fully homogeneous and isotropic universe is reproduced with a
small distance dispersion, whereas in the second case, the distance dispersion
is larger. This result suggests that we might obtain information about the
typical mass of lens objects through the distance-redshift relation gleaned
through observation of gravitational waves of various wavelengths. In this
paper, we show how to set limitations on the mass $M_L$ through the observation
of gravitational waves in the clumpy universe model described above.",2006-04-06T08:34:59Z
The milliarcsecond-scale jet of PKS 0735+178 during quiescence,"We present polarimetric 5 GHz to 43 GHz VLBI observations of the BL Lacertae
object PKS 0735+178, spanning March 1996 to May 2000. Comparison with previous
and later observations suggests that the overall kinematic and structural
properties of the jet are greatly influenced by its activity. Time intervals of
enhanced activity, as reported before 1993 and after 2000 by other studies, are
followed by highly superluminal motion along a rectilinear jet. In contrast the
less active state in which we performed our observations, shows subluminal or
slow superluminal jet features propagating through a twisted jet with two sharp
bends of about 90 deg. within the innermost three-milliarcsecond jet structure.
Proper motion estimates from the data presented here allow us to constrain the
jet viewing angle to values < 9 deg., and the bulk Lorentz factor to be between
2 and 4.",2006-04-26T11:13:42Z
A 0.8-2.4 microns spectral atlas of Active Galactic Nuclei,"Aims: We present a near-infrared spectral atlas of 47 active galactic nuclei
(AGN), of all degrees of activity, in the wavelength interval of 0.8-2.4
microns, including the fluxes of the observed emission lines. We analyze the
spectroscopic properties of the continuum and emission line spectra of the
sources Methods: In order to exclude aperture and seeing effects we use
near-infrared spectroscopy in the short cross-dispersed mode (SXD, 0.8-2.4
microns), taking the JHK-bands spectra simultaneously. Results: We present the
most extensive NIR spectral atlas of AGN to date. This atlas offers a suitable
database for studying the continuum and line emission properties of these
objects in a region full of interesting features. The shape of the continuum of
QSOs and Seyfert 1's are similar, being essentially flat in H and K band, in
the J band, a strong variation is found. In Seyfert 2 galaxies, the continuum
in the F_lambda X lambda space smoothly decreases from 1.2 microns redwards in
almost all sources. In J, it smoothly rises bluewards in some sources while in
others a small decreased in flux is observed. The spectra are dominated by
strong emission features of H I, He I, He II, [S III] and conspicuous forbidden
lines of low and high ionization species. Molecular lines of H2 are common
features to most objects. The absence of O I and Fe II lines in Seyfert 2
galaxies give observational support to the fact that these lines are formated
in the outermost portion of the broad line region. [P II] and coronal lines are
detected in all degrees of activity. The [Fe II] 12570A/16436A line ratio
becomes a reliable reddening indicator for the narrow-line region of Seyfert
galaxies.",2006-05-18T17:11:08Z
"Helium enhancements in globular cluster stars from Asymptotic Giant
  Branch star pollution","Using a chemical evolution model we investigate the intriguing suggestion
that there are populations of stars in some globular clusters (e.g. NGC 2808,
omega Centauri) with enhanced levels of helium (Y from about 0.28 to 0.40)
compared to the majority of the population that presumably have a primordial
helium abundance. We assume that a previous generation of massive
low-metallicity Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars has polluted the cluster
gas via a slow stellar wind. We use two independent sets of AGB yields computed
from detailed models to follow the evolution of helium, carbon, nitrogen and
oxygen in the cluster gas using a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) and a
number of top-heavy IMFs. In no case were we able to fit the observational
constraints, Y > 0.30 and C+N+O approximately constant. Depending on the shape
of the IMF and the yields, we either obtained Y approximately greater than 0.30
and large increases in C+N+O or Y < 0.30 and C+N+O approximately constant.
These results suggest that either AGB stars alone are not responsible for the
large helium enrichment or that any dredge-up from this generation of stars was
less than predicted by standard models.",2006-05-21T21:56:23Z
Wave-mechanics and the adhesion approximation,"The dynamical equations describing the evolution of a self-gravitating fluid
of cold dark matter (CDM) can be written in the form of a Schrodinger equation
coupled to a Poisson equation describing Newtonian gravity. It has recently
been shown that, in the quasi-linear regime, the Schrodinger equation can be
reduced to the exactly solvable free-particle Schrodinger equation. The
free-particle Schrodinger equation forms the basis of a new approximation
scheme -the free-particle approximation - that is capable of evolving
cosmological density perturbations into the quasi-linear regime. The
free-particle approximation is essentially an alternative to the adhesion model
in which the artificial viscosity term in Burgers' equation is replaced by a
non-linear term known as the quantum pressure. Simple one-dimensional tests of
the free-particle method have yielded encouraging results. In this paper we
comprehensively test the free-particle approximation in a more cosmologically
relevant scenario by appealing to an N-body simulation. We compare our results
with those obtained from two established methods: the linearized fluid approach
and the Zeldovich approximation. We find that the free-particle approximation
comprehensively out-performs both of these approximation schemes in all tests
carried out and thus provides another useful analytical tool for studying
structure formation on cosmological scales.",2006-04-29T19:02:31Z
Characterizing Charge Diffusion in CCDs with X-rays,"We demonstrate the effectiveness of two techniques for using x-rays to
evaluate the amount of charge diffusion in charge coupled devices (CCDs). We
quantify the degree of charge diffusion with two parameters: sigma_d, the
standard deviation for a Gaussian diffusion model, and Q, a ratio of the point
spread function (PSF) peak to its wings. sigma_d and Q are determined by
fitting a model to a pixel energy histogram, and by summing the PSF of all
x-ray events, respectively. Using seven test devices, we investigate the
precision of these two techniques and demonstrate that they produce compatible
results. The histogram fitting method is sensitive to the structure of the
electric field within these devices, in addition to the inherent charge
diffusion properties. The Q ratio is a very simple parameter to measure and
provides an easily accessible method for quickly evaluating a CCD's diffusion
length.",2006-04-14T00:31:33Z

The Southern Flanking Fields of the 25 Orionis Group,"The stellar group surrounding the Be (B1Vpe) star 25 Orionis was discovered
to be a pre-main-sequence population by the Centro de Investigaciones de
Astronomia (CIDA) Orion Variability Survey and subsequent spectroscopy. We
analyze Sloan Digital Sky Survey multi-epoch photometry to map the southern
extent of the 25 Ori group and to characterize its pre-main-sequence
population. We compare this group to the neighboring Orion OB1a and OB1b
subassociations and to active star formation sites (NGC 2068/NGC 2071) within
the Lynds 1630 dark cloud. We find that the 25 Ori group has a radius of 1.4
degrees, corresponding to 8-11 pc at the distances of Orion OB1a and OB1b.
Given that the characteristic sizes of young open clusters are a few pc or less
this suggests that 25 Ori is an unbound association rather than an open
cluster. Due to its PMS population having a low Classical T Tauri fraction
(~10%) we conclude that the 25 Ori group is of comparable age to the 11 Myr
Orion OB1a subassociation.",2006-03-13T19:25:50Z
"Filaments, Bubbles, and Weak Shocks in the Gaseous Atmosphere of M87","We present the first results from a 500 ksec Chandra ACIS-I observation of
M87. At soft energies (0.5-1.0 keV), we detect filamentary structures
associated with the eastern and southwestern X-ray and radio arms. Many
filaments are spatially resolved with widths of ~300 pc. This filamentary
structure is particularly striking in the eastern arm where we suggest the
filaments are outer edges of a series of plasma-filled, buoyant bubbles whose
ages differ by ~6 x 10^6 years. These X-ray structures may be influenced by
magnetic filamentation. At hard energies (3.5-7.5 keV), we detect a nearly
circular ring of outer radius 2.8' (13 kpc) which provides an unambiguous
signature of a weak shock, driven by an outburst from the SMBH. The density
rise in the shock is ~1.3 (Mach number, M~1.2). The observed spectral hardening
in the ring corresponds to a temperature rise T_shock / T_0 ~ 1.2, or M~1.2, in
agreement with the Mach number derived independently from the gas density.
Thus, for the first time, we detect gas temperature and density jumps
associated with a classical shock in the atmosphere around a supermassive black
hole. We also detect two additional surface brightness edges and pressure
enhancements at radii of ~0.6' and ~1'. The ~0.6' feature may be
over-pressurized thermal gas surrounding the relativistic plasma in the radio
cocoon, the ``piston'', produced by the current episode of AGN activity. The
over-pressurized gas is surrounded by a cool gas shell. The ~1' feature may be
an additional weak shock from a secondary outburst. In an earlier episode, the
``piston'' was responsible for driving the 2.8' shock.",2006-04-27T20:35:41Z
"No Expanding Fireball: Resolving the Recurrent Nova RS Ophiuchi with
  Infrared Interferometry","Following the recent outburst of the recurrent nova RS Oph on 2006 Feb 12, we
measured its near-infrared size using the IOTA, Keck, and PTI Interferometers
at multiple epochs. The characteristic size of ~3 milliarcseconds hardly
changed over the first 60 days of the outburst, ruling out currently-popular
models whereby the near-infrared emission arises from hot gas in the expanding
shock. The emission was also found to be significantly asymmetric, evidenced by
non-zero closure phases detected by IOTA. The physical interpretation of these
data depend strongly on the adopted distance to RS Oph. Our data can be
interpreted as the first direct detection of the underlying RS Oph binary,
lending support to the recent ``reborn red giant'' models of Hachisu & Kato.
However, this result hinges on an RS Oph distance of ~< 540 pc, in strong
disagreement with the widely-adopted distance of ~1.6 kpc. At the farther
distance, our observations imply instead the existence of a non-expanding,
dense and ionized circumbinary gaseous disk or reservoir responsible for the
bulk of the near-infrared emission. Longer-baseline infrared interferometry is
uniquely suited to distinguish between these models and to ultimately determine
the distance, binary orbit, and component masses for RS Oph, one of the
closest-known (candidate) SNIa progenitor systems.",2006-07-17T21:21:53Z
A focal plane detector design for a wide-band Laue-lens telescope,"The energy range above 60 keV is important for the study of many open
problems in high energy astrophysics such as the role of Inverse Compton with
respect to synchrotron or thermal processes in GRBs, non thermal mechanisms in
SNR, the study of the high energy cut-offs in AGN spectra, and the detection of
nuclear and annihilation lines. Recently the development of high energy Laue
lenses with broad energy bandpasses from 60 to 600 keV have been proposed for a
Hard X ray focusing Telescope (HAXTEL) in order to study the X-ray continuum of
celestial sources. The required focal plane detector should have high detection
efficiency over the entire operative range, a spatial resolution of about 1 mm,
an energy resolution of a few keV at 500 keV and a sensitivity to linear
polarization. We describe a possible configuration of the focal plane detector
based on several CdTe/CZT pixelated layers stacked together to achieve the
required detection efficiency at high energy. Each layer can operate both as a
separate position sensitive detector and polarimeter or work with other layers
to increase the overall photopeak efficiency. Each layer has a hexagonal shape
in order to minimize the detector surface required to cover the lens field of
view. The pixels would have the same geometry so as to provide the best
coupling with the lens point spread function and to increase the symmetry for
polarimetric studies.",2006-05-19T12:56:34Z
On the formation of dwarf galaxies and stellar halos,"Using analytic arguments and a suite of very high resolution (10^3 Msun per
particle) cosmological hydro-dynamical simulations, we argue that high
redshift, z ~ 10, M ~ 10^8 Msun halos, form the smallest `baryonic building
block' (BBB) for galaxy formation. These halos are just massive enough to
efficiently form stars through atomic line cooling and to hold onto their gas
in the presence of supernovae winds and reionisation. These combined effects,
in particular that of the supernovae feedback, create a sharp transition: over
the mass range 3-10x10^7 Msun, the BBBs drop two orders ofmagnitude in stellar
mass. Below ~2x10^7 Msun, galaxies will be dark with almost no stars and no
gas. Above this scale is the smallest unit of galaxy formation: the BBB.
  A small fraction (~100) of these gas rich BBBs fall in to a galaxy the size
of the Milky Way. Ten percent of these survive to become the observed LG dwarf
galaxies at the present epoch. Those in-falling halos on benign orbits which
keep them far away from the Milky Way or Andromeda manage to retain their gas
and slowly form stars - these become the smallest dwarf irregular galax ies;
those on more severe orbits lose their gas faster than they can form stars and
become the dwarf spheroidals. The remaining 90% of the BBBs will be accreted.
We show that this gives a metallicity and total stellar mass consistent with
the Milky Way old stellar halo (abridged).",2006-06-16T08:23:03Z
"Virgo cluster early-type dwarf galaxies with the Sloan Digital Sky
  Survey. I. On the possible disk nature of bright early-type dwarfs","We present a systematic search for disks in 476 Virgo cluster early-type
dwarf (dE) galaxies. Disk features (spiral arms, edge-on disks, or bars) were
identified by applying unsharp masks to a combined image from three bands (g,
r, i), as well as by subtracting the axisymmetric light distribution of each
galaxy from that image. 14 objects are unambiguous identifications of disks, 10
objects show 'probable disk' features, and 17 objects show 'possible disk'
features. The number fraction of these galaxies, for which we introduce the
term dEdi, reaches more than 50% at the bright end of the dE population, and
decreases to less than 5% for magnitudes B>16. The luminosity function of our
full dE sample can be explained by a superposition of dEdis and ordinary dEs,
strongly suggesting that dEdis are a distinct type of galaxy. This is supported
by the projected spatial distribution: dEdis show basically no clustering and
roughly follow the spatial distribution of spirals and irregulars, whereas
ordinary dEs are distributed similarly to the strongly clustered E/S0 galaxies.
While the flattening distribution of ordinary dEs is typical for spheroidal
objects, the distribution of dEdis is significantly different and agrees with
their being flat oblate objects. We therefore conclude that the dEdis are not
spheroidal galaxies that just have an embedded disk component, but are instead
a population of genuine disk galaxies. Several dEdis display well-defined
spiral arms with grand design features that clearly differ from the flocculent,
open arms typical for late-type spirals that have frequently been proposed as
progenitors of early-type dwarfs. This raises the question of what process is
able to create such spiral arms - with pitch angles like those of Sab/Sb
galaxies - in bulgeless dwarf galaxies. (Abridged)",2006-04-10T20:00:15Z

New Approaches for Modeling Type Ia Supernovae,"Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are the largest thermonuclear explosions in the
Universe. Their light output can be seen across great distances and has led to
the discovery that the expansion rate of the Universe is accelerating. Despite
the significance of SNe Ia, there are still a large number of uncertainties in
current theoretical models. Computational modeling offers the promise to help
answer the outstanding questions. However, even with today's supercomputers,
such calculations are extremely challenging because of the wide range of length
and time scales. In this paper, we discuss several new algorithms for
simulations of SNe Ia and demonstrate some of their successes.",2006-06-28T19:44:28Z
"Isolated neutron stars: Magnetic fields, distances, and spectra","We present timing measurements, astrometry, and high-resolution spectra of a
number of nearby, thermally emitting, isolated neutron stars. We use these to
infer magnetic field strengths and distances, but also encounter a number of
puzzles. We discuss three specific ones in detail: (i) For RX J0720.4-3125 and
RX J1308.6+2127, the characteristic ages are in excess of 1~Myr, while their
temperatures and kinematic ages indicate that they are much younger; (ii) For
RX J1856.5-3754, the brightness temperature for the optical emission is in
excess of that measured at X-ray wavelengths for reasonable neutron-star radii;
(iii) For RX J0720.4-3125, the spectrum changed from an initially featureless
state to one with an absorption feature, yet there was only a relatively small
change in effective temperature. Furthermore, we attempt to see whether the
spectra of all seven sourced, in six of which absorption features have now been
found, can be understood in the context of strongly magnetised hydrogen
atmospheres. We find that the energies of the absorption features can be
reproduced, but that the featureless spectra of some sources, especially the
Wien-like high-energy tails, remain puzzling.",2006-07-14T02:37:23Z
"The VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey. Color bimodality and the mix of galaxy
  populations up to z~2","In this paper we discuss the mix of star-forming and passive galaxies up to
z~2, based on the first epoch VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey (VVDS) data.In agreement
with previous works we find that the galaxy rest-frame color distribution
follows a bimodal distribution at z<=1, and we establish that this bimodality
holds up to z~2. The details of the rest-frame color distribution depend
however on redshift and on galaxy luminosity: faint galaxies are bluer than the
luminous ones over the whole redshift range of our data, and galaxies become
bluer as redshift increases. This blueing trend does not depend, to a first
approximation, on galaxy luminosity. Using our spectroscopic dataset we can
also separate galaxies based on a star-formation, estimated combining the
equivalent width of the [OII] emission line and the strength of the Dn(4000)
break. The comparison between this spectral classification and the rest-frame
colors shows that about 35-40 % of the red objects are star forming galaxies.
Hence we conclude that the red sequence cannot be used to effectively isolate a
sample of purely passively evolving objects within a cosmological survey. We
also find that the color-magnitude relations derived for the color and for the
spectroscopically selected early-type galaxies have remarkably similar
properties, with the contaminating star-forming galaxies within the red
sequence objects introducing no significant offset in the rest frame colors.
Therefore the average color of the red objects does not appear to be a very
sensitive indicator for measuring the evolution of the early-type galaxy
population.Finally, we use the multi-band VVDS photometric data and SED fitting
to derive multi-color galaxy types, which have a slightly higher efficiency
than rest-frame color in isolating the passive, non star-forming galaxies
within the VVDS sample.",2006-07-05T14:30:31Z
"The AGN Outflow in the HDFS Target QSO J2233-606 from a High-Resolution
  VLT/UVES Spectrum","We present a detailed analysis of the intrinsic UV absorption in the central
HDFS target QSO J2233-606, based on a high-resolution, high S/N (~25 -- 50)
spectrum obtained with VLT/UVES. This spectrum samples the cluster of intrinsic
absorption systems outflowing from the AGN at radial velocities v ~ -5000 --
-3800 km/s in the key far-UV diagnostic lines - the lithium-like CNO doublets
and H I Lyman series. We fit the absorption troughs using a global model of all
detected lines to solve for the independent velocity-dependent covering factors
of the continuum and emission-line sources and ionic column densities. This
reveals increasing covering factors in components with greater outflow
velocity. Narrow substructure is revealed in the optical depth profiles,
suggesting the relatively broad absorption is comprised of a series of multiple
components. We perform velocity-dependent photoionization modeling, which
allows a full solution to the C, N, and O abundances, as well as the velocity
resolved ionization parameter and total column density. The absorbers are found
to have supersolar abundances, with [C/H] and [O/H] ~0.5 -- 0.9, and [N/H] ~
1.1 -- 1.3, consistent with enhanced nitrogen production expected from
secondary nucleosynthesis processes. Independent fits to each kinematic
component give consistent results for the abundances. The lowest-ionization
material in each of the strong absorbers is modeled with similar ionization
parameters. Components of higher-ionization (indicated by stronger O VI
relative to C IV and N V) are present at velocities just redward of each
low-ionization absorber. We explore the implications of these results for the
kinematic-geometric-ionization structure of the outflow.",2006-04-17T18:18:41Z
Near Infrared Adaptive Optics Imaging of QSO Host Galaxies,"We report near-infrared (primarily H-band) adaptive optics (AO) imaging with
the Gemini-N and Subaru Telescopes, of a representative sample of 32 nearby
(z<0.3) QSOs selected from the Palomar-Green (PG) Bright Quasar Survey (BQS),
in order to investigate the properties of the host galaxies. 2D modeling and
visual inspection of the images shows that ~36% of the hosts are ellipticals,
\~39% contain a prominent disk component, and ~25% are of undetermined type.
30% show obvious signs of disturbance. The mean M_H(host) = -24.82 (2.1L_H*),
with a range -23.5 to -26.5 (~0.63 to 10 L_H*). At <L_H*, all hosts have a
dominant disk component, while at >2 L_H* most are ellipticals. ""Disturbed""
hosts are found at all M_H(host), while ""strongly disturbed"" hosts appear to
favor the more luminous hosts. Hosts with prominent disks have less luminous
QSOs, while the most luminous QSOs are almost exclusively in ellipticals or in
mergers (which presumably shortly will be ellipticals). At z<0.13, where our
sample is complete at B-band, we find no clear correlation between M_B(QSO) and
M_H(host). However, at z>0.15, the more luminous QSOs (M_B<-24.7), and 4/5 of
the radio-loud QSOs, have the most luminous H-band hosts (>7L_H*), most of
which are ellipticals. Finally, we find a strong correlation between the
""infrared-excess"", L_IR/L_BB, of QSOs with host type and degree of disturbance.
Disturbed and strongly disturbed hosts and hosts with dominant disks have
L_IR/L_BB twice that of non-disturbed and elliptical hosts, respectively. QSOs
with ""disturbed"" and ""strongly-disturbed"" hosts are also found to have
morphologies and mid/far-infrared colors that are similar to what is found for
""warm"" ultraluminous infrared galaxies, providing further evidence for a
possible evolutionary connection between both classes of objects.",2006-05-03T03:14:23Z
Rapid Star Formation in the Presence of Active Galactic Nuclei,"Recent observations reveal galaxies in the early Universe (2<z<6.4) with
large reservoirs of molecular gas and extreme star formation rates. For a very
large range of sources, a tight relationship exists between star formation rate
and the luminosity of the HCN J=1-0 spectral line, but sources at redshifts of
z~2 and beyond do not follow this trend. The deficit in HCN is conventionally
explained by an excess of infrared (IR) radiation due to active galactic nuclei
(AGN). We show in this letter not only that the presence of AGN cannot account
for the excess of IR over molecular luminosity, but also that the observed
abundance of HCN is in fact consistent with a population of stars forming from
near-primordial gas.",2006-06-07T16:33:41Z
AEGIS20: a radio survey of the Extended Groth Strip,"We describe AEGIS20 - a radio survey of the Extended Groth Strip (EGS)
conducted with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 1.4GHz. The resulting catalog
contains 1,123 emitters and is sensitive to ultraluminous starbursts to z<=1.3,
well matched to the redshift range of the DEEP2 spectroscopic survey in this
region. We use stacking techniques to explore the uJy-level emission from a
variety of galaxy populations selected via conventional criteria - Lyman-break
galaxies (LBGs), distant red galaxies (DRGs), UV-selected galaxies and
extremely red objects (EROs) - determining their properties as a function of
color, magnitude and redshift and their extinction-free contributions to the
history of star formation. We confirm the familiar pattern that the
star-formation-rate (SFR) density, SFRD, rises by at least ~5x from z=0-1,
although we note highly discrepant UV- and radio-based SFR estimates. Our
radio-based SFRs become more difficult to interpret at z>1 where correcting for
contamination by radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) comes at the price of
rejecting luminous starbursts. Whilst stacking radio images is a useful
technique, accurate radio-based SFRs for z>>1 galaxies require precise
redshifts and extraordinarily high-fidelity radio data to identify and remove
accretion-related emission.",2006-07-12T20:04:13Z
Galaxy orbits and the intracluster gas temperature in clusters,"In this paper we examine how well galaxies and intra-cluster gas trace the
gravitational potential of clusters. Utilizing mass profiles derived from
gravitational lensing and X-ray observations, coupled with measured galaxy
velocities, we solve for the velocity anisotropy parameter using the
anisotropic Jeans equation. This is done for five clusters, three at low
redshift: A2199, A496 and A576 and two at high redshifts: A2390 and MS1358.
With X-ray temperature profiles obtained from Chandra and ASCA/ROSAT data, we
estimate the ratio of energy in the galaxies compared to the X-ray gas. We find
that none of these clusters is strictly in hydro-static equilibrium. We compare
the properties of our sample with clusters that form in high-resolution
cosmological N-body simulations that include baryonic physics. Simulations and
data show considerable scatter both these profiles. We demonstrate the future
feasibility and potential for directly comparing the orbital structure of
clusters inferred from multi-wavelength observations with high resolution
simulated clusters.",2006-05-03T20:00:08Z
No-go theorem for k-essence dark energy,"We demonstrate that if k-essence can solve the coincidence problem and play
the role of dark energy in the universe, the fluctuations of the field have to
propagate superluminally at some stage. We argue that this implies that
successful k-essence models violate causality. It is not possible to define a
time ordered succession of events in a Lorentz invariant way. Therefore,
k-essence cannot arise as low energy effective field theory of a causal,
consistent high energy theory.",2006-06-23T13:06:51Z
"Fe emission and ionized excess absorption in the luminous quasar 3C109
  with XMM-Newton","We report results from an XMM-Newton observation of the broad-line radio
galaxy 3C109 (z=0.3056). Confirming previous results, an Fe emission line is
detected, possibly comprising a broad component. However, the data cannot
distinguish between an untruncated accretion disc and a case in which the
innermost 20-30 gravitational radii are missing. In fact, a partial-covering
plus narrow Fe line scenario is not ruled out statistically. However, the
absorber would have to comprise hundreds/thousands very compact clouds close to
the X-ray source, which seems rather extreme a requirement. The 2-10 keV
intrinsic luminosity of 3C109 is of the order of 2-3x10^45 erg/s which,
combined with a recent black hole mass estimate of ~2x10^8 M_sun, implies an
Eddington ratio greater than unity. If partial covering is excluded, the
observed reflection fraction (of the order of unity), steep photon index
(1.86), and Fe line equivalent width (about 100 eV) all suggest to exclude that
the X-ray continuum is strongly beamed, indicating that the large Eddington
ratio is associated with a radiatively efficient accretion process. We also
confirm previous findings on the detection of low energy absorption in excess
of the Galactic value. The better quality of the XMM-Newton data enables us to
attribute the excess absorption to slightly ionized gas in the line of sight,
located at the redshift of 3C109. [abriged]",2006-05-31T16:48:56Z
"Two evolutional paths of an axisymmetric gravitational instability in
  the dust layer of a protoplanetary disk","Nonlinear numerical simulations are performed to investigate the density
evolution in the dust layer of a protoplanetary disk due to the gravitational
instability and dust settling toward the midplane. We assume the region where
the radial pressure gradient at equilibrium is negligible so that the
shear-induced instability is avoided, and also restrict to an axisymmetric
perturbation as a first step of nonlinear numerical simulations of the
gravitational instability. We find that there are two different evolutional
paths of the gravitational instability depending on the nondimensional gas
friction time, which is defined as the product of the gas friction time and the
Keplerian angular velocity. If the nondimensional gas friction time is equal to
0.01, the gravitational instability grows faster than dust settling. On the
other hand, if the nondimensional gas friction time is equal to 0.1, dust
aggregates settle sufficiently before the gravitational instability grows. In
the latter case, an approximate analytical calculation reveals that dust
settling is faster than the growth of the gravitational instability regardless
of the dust density at the midplane. Thus, the dust layer becomes extremely
thin and may reach a few tenth of the material density of the dust before the
gravitational instability grows.",2006-05-08T08:21:38Z
The Fate of Discs around Massive Stars in Young Clusters,"AIMS: The aim of this work is to understand whether there is a difference in
the dispersion of discs around stars in high-density young stellar clusters
like the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) according to the mass of the star.
  METHODS: Two types of simulations were combined -- N-body simulations of the
dynamics of the stars in the ONC and mass loss results from simulations of
star-disc encounters, where the disc mass loss of all stars is determined as a
function of time.
  RESULTS: We find that in the Trapezium, the discs around high-mass stars are
dispersed much more quickly and to a larger degree by their gravitational
interaction than for intermediate-mass stars. This is consistent with the very
recent observations of IC 348, where a higher disc frequency was found around
solar mass stars than for more massive stars, suggesting that this might be a
general trend in large young stellar clusters.",2006-04-04T05:51:28Z
The pattern of accretion flow onto Sgr A*,"The material accreting onto Sgr A* most probably comes from the nearby stars.
We analyze the pattern of this flow at distances of a fraction of a parsec and
we argue that the net angular momentum of this material is low but
non-negligible, and the initially supersonic disk accretion changes into
subsonic flow with constant angular momentum. Next we estimate the flow
parameters at a distance $R_{BHL}$ from the black hole and we argue that for
the plausible parameter range the accretion flow is non-stationary. The inflow
becomes supersonic at distance of $\sim 10^4 R_g$ but the solution does not
continue below the horizon and the material piles up forming a torus, or a
ring, at a distance of a few up to tens of Schwarzchild radii. Such a torus is
known to be unstable and may explain strong variability of the flow in Sgr A*.
Our considerations show that the temporary formation of such a torus seems to
be unavoidable.
  Our best fitting model predicts a rather large accretion rate of around $4
\cdot 10^{-6} M_{\odot}/yr$ directly on Sgr A*. We argue that magnetic fields
in the flow are tangled and this allows our model to overcome the disagreement
with the Faraday rotation limits.",2006-04-25T07:50:32Z
Discovery of Interstellar CF+,"We discuss the first astronomical detection of the CF+ (fluoromethylidynium)
ion, obtained by observations of the J=1-0 (102.6 GHz), J=2-1 (205.2 GHz) and
J=3-2 (307.7 GHz) rotational transitions toward the Orion Bar region. Our
search for CF+, carried out using the IRAM 30m and APEX 12m telescopes, was
motivated by recent theoretical models that predict CF+ abundances of a few
times 1.E-10 in UV-irradiated molecular regions where C+ is present. The CF+
ion is produced by exothermic reactions of C+ with HF. Because fluorine atoms
can react exothermically with H2, HF is predicted to be the dominant reservoir
of fluorine, not only in well-shielded regions but also in the surface layers
of molecular clouds where the C+ abundance is large. The observed CF+ line
intensities imply the presence of CF+ column densities of at least 1.E+12 cm-2
over a region of size at least ~ 1 arcmin, in good agreement with theoretical
predictions. They provide support for our current theories of interstellar
fluorine chemistry, which suggest that hydrogen fluoride should be ubiquitous
in interstellar gas clouds and widely detectable in absorption by future
satellite and airborne observatories.",2006-03-08T17:05:36Z
Neutron-capture elements in the metal-poor globular cluster M15,"We report on observations of six giants in the globular cluster M15 (NGC
7078) using the Subaru Telescope to measure neutron-capture elemental
abundances. Our abundance analyses based on high-quality blue spectra confirm
the star-to-star scatter in the abundances of heavy neutron-capture elements
(e.g., Eu), and no significant s-process contribution to them, as was found in
previous studies. We have found, for the first time, that there are
anti-correlations between the abundance ratios of light to heavy
neutron-capture elements ([Y/Eu] and [Zr/Eu]) and heavy ones (e.g., Eu). This
indicates that light neutron-capture elements in these stars cannot be
explained by only a single r-process. Another process that has significantly
contributed to the light neutron-capture elements is required to have occurred
in M15. Our results suggest a complicated enrichment history for M15 and its
progenitor.",2006-03-13T21:19:22Z
"First evidence for molecular interfaces between outflows and ambient
  cloud in high-mass star forming regions?","We present new observations of the CepA-East region of massive star formation
and describe an extended and dynamically distinct feature not previously
recognised. This feature is present in emission from H2CS, OCS, CH3OH, and HDO
at -5.5 km/s, but is not traced by conventional tracers of star forming regions
H2S, SO2, SO, CS. The feature is extended up to at least 0.1 pc. We show that
the feature is neither a hot core nor a shocked outflow. However, the chemistry
of the feature is consistent with predictions of a model of an eroding
interface between a fast wind and a dense core; mixing between the two media
occurs in the interface on a timescale of 10-50 years. If these observations
are confirmed by detailed maps and by detections in species also predicted to
be abundant (e.g. HCO+, H2CO, and NH3) this feature would be the first
detection of such an interface in regions of massive star formation. An
important implication of the model is that a significant reservoir of sulfur in
grain mantles is required to be in the form of OCS.",2006-05-05T13:48:28Z
"Modelling galaxy spectra in presence of interstellar dust. II. From the
  UV to the far infrared","In this paper, we present spectrophotometric models for galaxies of different
morphological type whose spectral energy distributions (SEDs) take into account
the effect of dust in absorbing UV-optical light and re-emitting it in the
infrared (IR). The models contain three main components: (i) the diffuse
interstellar medium (ISM) composed of gas and dust, (ii) the large complexes of
molecular clouds (MCs) in which new stars are formed and (iii) the stars of any
age and chemical composition. The galaxy models stand on a robust model of
chemical evolution taylored in such a way to match the gross properties of
galaxies of different morphological type. A simple geometrical model is adopted
for each type of galaxy. The total gas and star mass provided by the chemical
model are distributed over the whole volume by means of suitable density
profiles, one for each component and depending on the galaxy type (spheroidal,
disk and disk plus bulge). The galaxy is then split in suitable volume elements
to each of which the appropriate amounts of stars, MCs and ISM are assigned. We
derive the SEDs of galaxies of different morphological type. First the the
basic relations driving the interaction between the physical components of the
galaxy are presented. Second, the main parameters are examined and their
effects on the SED of three prototype galaxies (a disk, an elliptical and a
starburster) are highlighted. The final part of the paper is devoted to assess
the ability of our galaxy models in reproducing the SEDs of a few real galaxies
of the Local Universe.",2006-05-22T15:16:11Z
"Solar ions in the heliosheath: a possible new source of heavy neutral
  atoms","We show that multiply ionized coronal C, N, O, Mg, Si, S ions carried by the
solar wind and neutralized by consecutive electron captures from neutral
interstellar atoms constitute an important new source of neutral atoms in the
inner heliosheath, with energies up to ~ 1 keV/n. In the model we developed,
the heavy ions are treated as test particles carried by hydrodynamic plasma
flow (with a Monte-Carlo description of interstellar neutrals) and undergoing
all relevant atomic processes determining the evolution of all charge-states of
considered species (radiative and dielectronic recombination, charge exchange,
photo-, and electron impact ionization). The total strength of the source is
from ~10^6 g/s for S to ~10^8 g/s for O, deposited as neutrals below the
heliopause. These atoms should provide, as they drift to supersonic wind
region, important sources of PUIs and eventually ACRs, especially for species
that are excluded from entering the heliosphere because of their ionization in
the LISM. The expected corresponding ENA fluxes at 1 AU are in the range 10^-4
- 10^0 at./(cm^2 s sr), depending on the species and direction (Table 2).",2006-04-28T13:39:15Z
Aromatic Features in M101 HII Regions and Starburst Galaxies,"The behavior of the aromatic features as a function of metallicity/radiation
field hardness in M101 HII regions and starburst galaxies is investigated using
Spitzer/IRS spectra. These spectra reveal that the 6.2, 7.8+8.6, and 11.3
micron aromatics have different dependencies on metallicity/radiation field
hardness. Specifically, the 6.2 and 7.8+8.6 micron aromatics are weak or absent
at a metallicity, 12+log(O/H), of approx. 8.0 while the 11.3 micron feature
remains relatively strong. These results apply to both the M101 HII regions and
starbursts showing that HII regions can indeed be thought of as
``mini-starbursts.'' Comparison of this work with various candidate materials
results in a good match with the annealing behavior in Quenched Carbonaceous
Composite (QCC) which is an amorphous, hydrogenated, carbonaceous solid.",2006-05-22T02:09:39Z
"Can Experiments Studying Ultrahigh Energy Cosmic Rays Measure the
  Evolution of the Sources?","Interactions between cosmic ray protons and the photons of the cosmic
microwave background radiation, as well as the expansion of the universe, cause
cosmic rays to lose energy in a way that depends on the distance from the
cosmic nray source to the earth. Because of this, there is a correlation
between cosmic ray energies and the average redshift of their origin. This
correlation may be exploited to measure the evolution of the sources of cosmic
rays.
  Sky surveys of Quasi Stellar Objects (QSO's) and Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN's), made at optical and x-ray wavelengths, are consistent in showing that
the evolution of such objects exhibits a break at a redshift, z, of about 1.6.
At smaller redshifts, the luminosity density of QSO's and AGN's follows a
$(1+z)^m$ distribution, with $m \sim 2.6$, and exhibit a much flatter
distribution above the break. Measurements of the star formation rate are also
consistent with this picture.
  If QSO's and AGN's are sources of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays the break in
their evolution should appear in the cosmic ray spectrum at an energy of about
$10^{17.6}$ eV. This is the energy of the second knee.",2006-03-29T17:14:35Z
Mass functions in coupled Dark Energy models,"We evaluate the mass function of virialized halos, by using Press & Schechter
(PS) and/or Steth & Tormen (ST) expressions, for cosmologies where Dark Energy
(DE) is due to a scalar self-interacting field, coupled with Dark Matter (DM).
We keep to coupled DE (cDE) models known to fit linear observables. To
implement the PS-ST approach, we start from reviewing and extending the results
of a previous work on the growth of a spherical top-hat fluctuation in cDE
models, confirming their most intriguing astrophysical feature, i.e. a
significant baryon-DM segregation, occurring well before the onset of any
hydrodynamical effect. Accordingly, the predicted mass function depends on how
halo masses are measured. For any option, however, the coupling causes a
distortion of the mass function, still at z=0. Furthermore, the z-dependence of
cDE mass functions is mostly displaced, in respect to LambdaCDM, in the
opposite way of uncoupled dynamical DE. This is an aspect of the basic
underlying result, that even a little DM-DE coupling induces relevant
modifications in the non-linear evolution. Therefore, without causing great
shifts in linear astrophysical observables, the DM-baryon segregation induced
by the coupling can have an impact on a number of cosmological problems, it
e.g., galaxy satellite abundance, spiral disk formation, apparent baryon
shortage, entropy input in clusters, etc..",2006-05-24T10:07:37Z
"Clumpiness of Dark Matter and Positron Annihilation Signal: Computing
  the odds of the Galactic Lottery","The small-scale distribution of dark matter in Galactic halos is poorly
known. Several studies suggest that it could be very clumpy, which turns out to
be of paramount importance when investigating the annihilation signal from
exotic particles (e.g. supersymmetric or Kaluza-Klein). In this paper we focus
on the annihilation signal in positrons. We estimate the associated
uncertainty, due to the fact that we do not know exactly how the clumps are
distributed in the Galactic halo. To this aim, we perform a statistical study
based on analytical computations, as well as numerical simulations. In
particular, we study the average and variance of the annihilation signal over
many Galactic halos having the same statistical properties. We find that the
so-called boost factor used by many authors should be handled with care, as i)
it depends on energy and ii) it may be different for positrons, antiprotons and
gamma rays, a fact which has not received any attention before. As an
illustration, we use our results to discuss the positron spectrum measurements
by the HEAT experiment.",2006-03-29T17:28:06Z
A Flare of AE Aquarii Observed with XMM-Newton,"We present the results of analyzing the XMM-Newton data obtained in 2001
November 7 - 8. A flare is observed simultaneously in X-ray and UV together
with a quiescence. We find that during the flare event X-ray flux varies with
UV with no significant time lag, indicating a close correlation of flux
variation for X-ray and UV flares. An upper limit of the lag is estimated to be
\~1 min. From a timing analysis for X-ray data, we find that both pulsed and
unpulsed flux increase clearly as the flare advances in the entire energy band
0.15 - 10 keV. The net increase of pulsed flux to the quiescence is, however,
small and corresponds to about 3 - 4% of the increase in unpulsed flux,
confirming that a flux variation of flare in AE Aqr is dominated by unpulsed
X-rays. A spectral analysis reveals that the energy spectrum is similar to that
of the quiescence at the beginning of the flare, but the spectrum becomes
harder as the flare advances. Based on these results, we discuss the current
issues that need to be clarified, e.g., the possible flaring site and the mass
accretion problem of the white dwarf. We also discuss the flare properties
obtained in this study.",2006-04-15T12:49:38Z
The Birth of Quark Stars: Photon-driven Supernovae?,"In this letter we propose a possible mechanism trying to alleviate the
current difficulty in core-collapse supernovae by forming a strange quark star
inside the collapsing core. Although the initial longtime cooling behavior of
nascent strange stars is dominated by neutrino emissions, thermal emissions
including photons and $e^\pm$ pair plasma do play a significant role in the
explosion dynamics under this picture. The key to promote a successful shock
outside a bare strange star is more likely to be the radiation pressure caused
by thermal photons rather than neutrinos in conventional models. We observed
through calculation that radiation pressure can push the overlying mantle away
through photon-electron scattering with energy (the work done by radiation
pressure) as much as ~10^{51} erg if protoquark stars are born with
temperatures higher than ~ (30-40) MeV. This result not only indicates that
strange quark stars should be bare ever since their formations, it could also
provide a possible explanation to the formation of fireballs in cosmic
long-soft $\gamma$-ray bursts associated to supernovae.",2006-05-11T08:17:07Z
4C 39.29 - extended emission around a powerful Type 2 quasar,"We present new X-ray and optical spectroscopy of a Type 2 quasar candidate
selected from a follow-up program of hard, optically-dim, serendipitous Chandra
sources. The source is confirmed to be a Type 2 quasar at z=0.536 with an
intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity L_{2-10}=5x10^{44} h_{0.7}^{-2} erg/s, an
absorbing column density N_H=8x10^{23} cm^{-2} and a neutral Fe K alpha line
detected by XMM-Newton EPIC-MOS1 as well as Chandra ACIS-S. An extended optical
forbidden emission line cloud is detected at the same redshift, and at about 15
kpc in projected separation. This cloud lies in close proximity to the peak of
the compact steep spectrum radio source 4C+39.29, which has previously been
identified with a foreground galaxy in the cluster Abell 963. We present
evidence to show that 4C+39.29 is associated with the background X-ray Type 2
quasar. The radio luminosity is dominated by lobes with complex structure and
the radio core is weak in comparison to narrow-line radio galaxies at the same
X-ray luminosity. The morphology and emission line properties of the extended

complex radio sources and distant obscured AGN.",2006-04-08T19:56:08Z
"Detection of the radial velocity curve of the B5-A0 supergiant companion
  star of Cir X-1?","In this Paper we report on phase resolved I-band optical spectroscopic and
photometric observations of CirX-1 obtained with the Very Large Telescope. The
spectra are dominated by Paschen absorption lines at nearly all orbital phases
except near phase zero (coinciding with the X-ray dip) when the absorption
lines are filled-in by broad Paschen emission lines. The radial velocity curve
of the absorption lines corresponds to an eccentric orbit (e=0.45) whose period
and time of periastron passage are consistent with the period and phase
predicted by the most recent X-ray dip ephemeris. We found that the I-band
magnitude decreases from 17.6 to ~16.8 near phase 0.9-1.0, this brightening
coincides in phase with the X-ray dip. Even though it is likely that the
absorption line spectrum is associated with the companion star of CirX-1, we
cannot exclude the possibility that the spectrum originates in the accretion
disc. However, if the spectrum belongs to the companion star, it must be a
supergiant of spectral type B5-A0. If we assume that the compact object does
not move through the companion star at periastron, the companion star mass is
constrained to ~<10 Msun for a 1.4 Msun neutron star, whereas the inclination
has to be ~> 13.7 degrees. Alternatively, the measured absorption lines and
their radial velocity curve can be associated with the accretion disc
surrounding a 1.4 Msun neutron star and its motion around the centre of mass.
An absorption line spectrum from an accretion disc is typically found when our
line-of-sight passes through the accretion disc rim implying a high
inclination. However, from radio observations it was found that the angle
between the line-of-sight and the jet axis is smaller than 5 degrees implying
that the jet ploughs through the accretion disc in this scenario.",2006-05-19T14:17:02Z
"A New Probe of Dense Gas at High Redshift: Detection of HCO+(5-4) Line
  Emission in APM 08279+5255","We report the detection of HCO+(5-4) emission from the Broad Absorption Line
(BAL) quasar APM08279+5255 at z=3.911 based on observations conducted at the
IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer. This represents the first detection of
this molecular ion at such a high redshift. The inferred line luminosity,
uncorrected for lensing, is L'(HCO+)=(3.5+-0.6)x10^10 Kkms^-1pc^2. The HCO+
J=5-4 source position coincides within the errors with that reported from
previous HCN J=5-4 and high-J CO line observations of this quasar. The HCO+
line profile central velocity and width are consistent with those derived from
HCN. This result suggests that HCO+(5-4) emission comes roughly from the same
circumnuclear region probed by HCN. However, the HCN(5-4)/HCO+(5-4) intensity
ratio measured in APM08279+5255 is significantly larger than that predicted by
simple radiative transfer models, which assume collisional excitation and equal
molecular abundances. This could imply that the [HCN]/[HCO^+] abundance ratio
is particularly large in this source, or that the J=5 rotational levels are
predominantly excited by IR fluorescent radiation.",2006-05-25T22:04:14Z
Neutrino-Accelerated Hot Hydrogen Burning,"We examine the effects of significant electron anti-neutrino fluxes on
hydrogen burning. Specifically, we find that the bottleneck weak nuclear
reactions in the traditional pp-chain and the hot CNO cycle can be accelerated
by anti-neutrino capture, increasing the energy generation rate. We also
discuss how anti-neutrino capture reactions can alter the conditions for break
out into the rp-process. We speculate on the impact of these considerations for
the evolution and dynamics of collapsing very- and super- massive compact
objects.",2006-06-23T00:26:22Z
Carbon Abundances in the Small Magellanic Cloud Planetary Nebulae,"As an ongoing study of Magellanic Cloud PNe we have obtained UV spectra of 9
PNe in the SMC to measure their carbon abundances. The spectra have been
acquired with ACS HRC/PR200L and SBC/PR130L. The ACS prisms give a reasonable
resolution in the range of 1200 -- 2500 A to detect the C IV, C III], and C II]
nebular emission, essential for chemical studies of the PNe. The carbon
abundances of SMC PNe, together with those of the LMC previously determined
with STIS spectroscopy, will allow a comparative study of nebular enrichment
and provide the basis for comparison with stellar evolution models at various
metallicity.",2006-05-31T01:24:41Z
"Selfgravitating Gas Spheres in a Box and Relativistic Clusters: Relation
  between Dynamical and Thermodynamical Stability","We derive a variational principle for the dynamical stability of a cluster as
a gas sphere in a box. Newtonian clusters are always dynamically stable and,
for relativistic clusters, the relation between dynamical and thermodynamical
instabilities is analyzed. The boundaries between dynamically and
thermodynamically stable and unstable models are found numerically for
relativistic stellar systems with different cut off parameters. A criterion
based on binding energy curve is used for determination of the boundary of
dynamical stability.",2006-03-15T16:07:36Z
"Numerical Simulations of the Lyman-alpha forest - A comparison of
  Gadget-2 and Enzo","We compare simulations of the Lyman-alpha forest performed with two different
hydrodynamical codes, Gadget-2 and Enzo. A comparison of the dark matter power
spectrum for simulations run with identical initial conditions show differences
of 1-3% at the scales relevant for quantitative studies of the Lyman-alpha
forest. This allows a meaningful comparison of the effect of the different
implementations of the hydrodynamic part of the two codes. Using the same
cooling and heating algorithm in both codes the differences in the temperature
and the density probability distribution function are of the order of 10%.
These differences can be mainly attributed to a slight mismatch in the
resolution. The differences are smaller than or equal to the effects of boxsize
and resolution on these statistics. Once resolution effects are taken into
account the differences in the flux power spectrum - the statistics most widely
used for estimating the matter power spectrum and cosmological parameters from
Lyman-alpha forest data - are about 5%. This is again smaller than or equal to
the effects of boxsize and resolution. Numerical uncertainties due to a
particular implementation of solving the hydrodynamic or gravitational
equations appear therefore to contribute only moderately to the error budget in
estimates of the flux power spectrum from numerical simulations. We further
find that the differences in the flux power spectrum for Enzo simulations run
with and without adaptive mesh refinement are also of order 5% or smaller. The
latter require 10 times less CPU time making the CPU time requirement similar
to that of a version of Gadget-2 that is optimised for Lyman-alpha forest
simulations.",2006-06-27T12:59:21Z
An Atlas of STIS-HST Spectra of Seyfert Galaxies,"We present a compilation of spectra of 101 Seyfert galaxies obtained with the
Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (HST-STIS), covering the UV and/or optical
spectral range. Information on all the available spectra have been collected in
a Mastertable, which is a very useful tool for anyone interested in a quick
glance at the existent STIS spectra for Seyfert galaxies in the HST archive,
and it can be recovered electronically at the URL address
www.if.ufrgs.br/~pat/atlas.htm. Nuclear spectra of the galaxies have been
extracted in windows of 0.2 arcsec for an optimized sampling (as this is the
slit width in most cases), and combined in order to improve the signal-to-noise
ratio and provide the widest possible wavelength coverage. These combined
spectra are also available electronically.",2006-05-26T19:15:29Z
Coincidence of Universe age in $Λ$CDM and Milne cosmologies,"The age of the Universe in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with
$\Omega_{matter}=0.26$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.74$ is the same as in the Milne
cosmology which correspods to an almost empty universe. In both cases it is a
reciprocal Hubble constant, $1/H_0$, that for now preferred value $H_0=71
km/s/Mpc$ is 13.7 billion years. The most curious coincidence is that at the
present time, in the $\Lambda$CDM model the decelerated expansion is exactly
compensated by the accelerated expansion, as if the Universe coast for 13.7
billion years.",2006-05-08T17:32:32Z
"On the validity of the 630 nm Fe I nm lines for the magnetometry of the
  internetwork quiet Sun","The purpose of this work is to analyze the reliability of the magnetic field
strengths inferred from the 630 nm pair of Fe I lines at internetwork quiet Sun
regions. Some numerical experiments have been performed that demonstrate the
inability of these lines to recover the magnetic field strength in such low
flux solar regions. It is shown how different model atmospheres, with magnetic
field strengths ranging from few hundred Gauss to kiloGauss, give rise to
Stokes profiles that can not be distinguished. The reasons for this degeneracy
are discussed.",2006-05-18T08:05:24Z
Intrinsic short time scale variability of W3(OH) maser,"We have studied the OH masers in the star forming region, W3(OH), with data
obtained from the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). The data provide an angular
resolution of $\sim$5 mas, and a velocity resolution of 106 m s$^{-1}$. A novel
analysis procedure allows us to differentiate between broadband temporal
intensity fluctuations introduced by instrumental gain variations plus
interstellar diffractive scintillation, and intrinsic narrowband variations.
Based on this 12.5 hours observation, we are sensitive to variations with time
scales of minutes to hours. We find statistically significant intrinsic
variations with time scales of $\sim$15--20 minutes or slower, based on the
{\it velocity-resolved fluctuation spectra}. These variations are seen
predominantly towards the line shoulders. The peak of the line profile shows
little variation, suggesting that they perhaps exhibit saturated emission. The
associated modulation index of the observed fluctuation varies from
statistically insignificant values at the line center to about unity away from
the line center. Based on light-travel-time considerations, the 20-minute time
scale of intrinsic fluctuations translates to a spatial dimension of $\sim$2--3
AU along the sight-lines. On the other hand, the transverse dimension of the
sources, estimated from their observed angular sizes of about $\sim$3 mas, is
about 6 AU. We argue that these source sizes are intrinsic, and are not
affected by interstellar scatter broadening. The implied peak brightness
temperature of the 1612/1720 maser sources is about $\sim2\times 10^{13}$ K,
and a factor of about five higher for the 1665 line.",2006-08-04T05:03:42Z
Adiabatic scaling relations of galaxy clusters,"The aim of the present work is to show that, contrary to popular belief,
galaxy clusters are **not** expected to be self-similar, even when the only
energy sources available are gravity and shock-wave heating. In particular, we
investigate the scaling relations between mass, luminosity and temperature of
galaxy groups and clusters in the absence of radiative processes. Theoretical
expectations are derived from a polytropic model of the intracluster medium and
compared with the results of high-resolution adiabatic gasdynamical
simulations. It is shown that, in addition to the well-known relation between
the mass and concentration of the dark matter halo, the effective polytropic
index of the gas also varies systematically with cluster mass, and therefore
neither the dark matter nor the gas profiles are exactly self-similar. It is
remarkable, though, that the effects of concentration and polytropic index tend
to cancel each other, leading to scaling relations whose logarithmic slopes
roughly match the predictions of the most basic self-similar models. We provide
a phenomenological fit to the relation between polytropic index and
concentration, as well as a self-consistent scheme to derive the non-linear
scaling relations expected for any cosmology and the best-fit normalizations of
the M-T, L-T and F-T relations appropriate for a Lambda-CDM universe. The
predicted scaling relations reproduce observational data reasonably well for
massive clusters, where the effects of cooling and star formation are expected
to play a minor role.",2006-05-30T15:30:35Z
"Influence of Thermalisation on Electron Injection in Supernova Remnant
  Shocks","Within a test-particle description of the acceleration process in parallel
nonrelativistic shocks, we present an analytic treatment of the electron
injection. We estimate the velocity distribution of the injected electrons as
the product of the post-shock thermal distribution of electrons times the
probability for electrons with a given velocity to be accelerated; the
injection efficiency is then evaluated as the integral of this velocity
distribution. We estimate the probability of a particle to be injected as that
of going back to the upstream region at least once. This is the product of the
probability of returning to the shock from downstream times that of recrossing
the shock from downstream to upstream. The latter probability is expected to be
sensitive to details of the process of electron thermalisation within the
(collisionless) shock, a process that is poorly known. In order to include this
effect, for our treatment we use results of a numerical, fully kinetic study,
by Bykov & Uvarov (1999). According to them, the probability of recrossing
depends on physics of thermalisation through a single free parameter (Gamma),
which can be expressed as a function of the Mach number of the shock, of the
level of electron-ion equilibration, as well as of the spectrum of turbulence.
It becomes apparent, from our analysis, that the injection efficiency is
related to the post-shock electron temperature, and that it results from the
balance between two competing effects: the higher the electron temperature, the
higher the fraction of downstream electrons with enough velocity to return to
the shock and thus to be ready to cross the shock from downstream to upstream;
at the same time, however, the higher the turbulence, which would hinder the
crossing.",2006-06-05T11:44:47Z
"Recipes for stellar jets: results of combined optical/infrared
  diagnostics","We examine the conditions of the plasma along a sample of 'classical'
Herbig-Haro jets located in the Orion and Vela star forming regions, through
combined optical-infrared spectral diagnostics. Our sample includes HH 111, HH
34, HH 83, HH 73, HH 24 C/E, HH 24 J, observed at moderate spatial/spectral
resolution. The obtained spectra cover a wide wavelength range from 0.6-2.5 um,
including many transitions from regions of different excitation conditions.
This allows us to probe the density and temperature stratification which
characterises the cooling zones behind the shock fronts along the jet. The
derived physical parameters (such as the extinction, the electron density and
temperature, the ionisation fraction, and the total density) are used to
estimate the depletion onto dust grains of Calcium and Iron with respect to
solar abundances. This turns out to be between 70% and 0% for Ca and ~90% for
Fe, suggesting that the weak shocks present in the beams are not capable of
completely destroying the dust grains. We then derive the mass flux rates
(Mdot_jet is on average 5 10^-8 M_solar yr^-1) and the associated linear
momentum fluxes. The latter are higher than, or of the same order as, those
measured in the coaxial molecular flows, suggesting that the flows are jet
driven. Finally, we discuss differences between jets in our sample.",2006-06-12T20:21:07Z
"Eclipsing binaries observed with the WIRE satellite I. Discovery and
  photometric analysis of the new bright A0IV eclipsing binary Psi Centauri","Determinations of stellar mass and radius with realistic uncertainties at the
level of 1% provide important constraints on models of stellar structure and
evolution. We present a high-precision light curve of the A0IV star Psi
Centauri, from the star tracker on board the WIRE satellite and the Solar Mass
Ejection Imager camera on the Coriolis spacecraft. The data show that Psi Cen
is an eccentric eclipsing binary system with a relatively long orbital period.
The WIRE light curve extends over 28.7 nights and contains 41334 observations
with 2 mmag point-to-point scatter. The eclipse depths are 0.28 and 0.16 mag,
and show that the two eclipsing components of Psi Cen have very different
radii. As a consequence, the secondary eclipse is total. We find the
eccentricity to be e=0.55 with an orbital period of 38.8 days from combining
the WIRE light curve with data taken over two years from the Solar Mass
Ejection Imager camera. We have fitted the light curve with EBOP and have
assessed the uncertainties of the resulting parameters using Monte Carlo
simulations. The fractional radii of the stars and the inclination of the orbit
have random errors of only 0.1% and 0.01 degrees, respectively, but the
systematic uncertainty in these quantities may be somewhat larger. We have used
photometric calibrations to estimate the effective temperatures of the
components of Psi Cen to be 10450+-300 and 8800+-300 K, indicating masses of
about 3.1 and 2.0 Msun. There is evidence in the WIRE light curve for g-mode
pulsations in the primary star.",2006-06-22T09:23:03Z
HI in Local Group analogs: what does it tell us about galaxy formation?,"We present the results of our HI survey of six loose groups of galaxies
analogous to the Local Group. The survey was conducted using the Parkes
telescope and the Australia Telescope Compact Array to produce a census of all
the gas-rich galaxies and potential analogs to the high-velocity clouds (HVCs)
within these groups down to M(HI)<10^7 M(sun) as a test of models of galaxy
formation. We present the HI mass function and halo mass function for these
analogous groups and compare them with the Local Group and other environments.
We also demonstrate that our non-detection of HVC analogs in these groups
implies that they must have low HI masses and be clustered tightly around
galaxies, including around our own Milky Way, and are not distributed
throughout the Local Group.",2006-03-23T06:29:14Z
Using cosmology to constrain the topology of hidden dimensions,"A four-dimensional universe, arising from a flux compactification of Type IIB
string theory, contains scalar fields with a potential determined by
topological and geometric parameters of the internal -hidden- dimensions. We
show that inflation can be realized via rolling towards the large internal
volume minima that are generic in these scenarios, and we give explicit
formulae relating the microscopic parameters (e.g., the Euler number of the
internal space) to the cosmological observables (e.g., the spectral index). We
find that the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the running of the spectral index, and
the potential energy density at the minimum are related by consistency
relations and are exponentially small in the number of e-foldings. Further,
requiring that these models arise as low-energy limits of string theory
eliminates most of them, even if they are phenomenologically valid. In this
context, this approach provides a strategy for systematically falsifying
stringy inflation models.",2006-05-15T22:20:50Z
A quasi periodic signal with ultra low frequency discovered in V0332+53?,"The reported likely QPO is found to be an instrumental effect, which was

Estimation of Polarized Power Spectra by Gibbs sampling,"Earlier papers introduced a method of accurately estimating the angular
cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature power spectrum based on Gibbs
sampling. Here we extend this framework to polarized data. All advantages of
the Gibbs sampler still apply, and exact analysis of mega-pixel polarized data
sets is thus feasible. These advantages may be even more important for
polarization measurements than for temperature measurements. While approximate
methods can alias power from the larger E-mode spectrum into the weaker B-mode
spectrum, the Gibbs sampler (or equivalently, exact likelihood evaluations)
allows for a statistically optimal separation of these modes in terms of power
spectra. To demonstrate the method, we analyze two simulated data sets: 1) a
hypothetical future CMBPol mission, with the focus on B-mode estimation; and 2)
a Planck-like mission, to highlight the computational feasibility of the
method.",2006-08-01T00:32:03Z
Primordial gas cooling behind shock waves in merging halos,"We investigate thermal regime of the baryons behind shock waves arising in
the process of virialization of dark matter halos. We find a fraction of the
shocked gas cooled by radiation of HD molecules down to the temperature of the
cosmic microwave background (CMB): this fraction increases sharply from about
$f_{\rm c}\sim 10^{-3}$ for dark halos of $M=5\times 10^7\msun$ to $\sim 0.1$
for halos with $M=10^8\msun$ at $z=10$. We show, however, that further increase
of the mass does not lead to a significant growth of $f_{\rm c}$ -- the
assymptotic value for $M\gg 10^8\msun$ is of 0.2. We estimate star formation
rate associated with such shock waves, and show that it can be a small but not
negligible fraction of the star formation connected with cooling by HI and
H$_2$. We argue that extremely metal-poor low-mass stars in the Milky Way may
have been formed from primordial gas behind such shocks.",2006-04-19T09:36:27Z
Radio Constraints on Activity in Young Brown Dwarfs,"We report on searches for radio emission from three of the nearest known
young brown dwarfs using the Very Large Array. We have obtained sensitive upper
limits on 3.6cm emission from 2MASSW J1207334-393254, TWA~5B and SSSPM
J1102-3431, all of which are likely members of the $\sim$8-Myr-old TW Hydrae
association. We derive constraints on the magnetic field strength and the
number density of accelerated electrons, under the assumption that young brown
dwarf atmospheres are able to produce gyrosynchrotron emission, as seems to be
indicated in older brown dwarfs. For the young brown dwarf TWA~5B, the ratio of
its detected X-ray luminosity to the upper limit on radio luminosity places it
within the expected range for young stars and older, active stars. Thus, its
behavior is anomalous compared to older brown dwarfs, in which radio luminosity
is substantially enhanced over the expected relationship. Our observations
deepen the conundrum of magnetic activity in brown dwarfs, and suggest that a
factor other than age is more important for determining radio emission in cool
substellar objects.",2006-04-25T15:36:55Z
A new sample of bright galaxy pairs in UZC,"We present a new sample of bright galaxy pairs extracted applying an
objective selection code to UZC catalog.The sample is volume limited to
M$_{zw}$ = -18.9 +5 log ${\it h}$ and contains 89 galaxy pairs.We analyze the
kinematical, morphological and photometrical properties of galaxies belonging
to this sample. We show that velocity separation, $| \Delta v_{r} |$, between
pair members is significantly lower in spiral type (S+S) pairs than in
early-type (E+E) and mixed (E+S) pairs.This indicates that truly isolated
galaxy pairs are more likely to be found among S+S pairs. We show that
ellipticals are rare and underluminous in B and that late spirals (T $\ge$ 4)
are overluminous. We confirm that the formation of bright ellipticals is a
phenomenon linked to group/cluster environment, while galaxy-galaxy interaction
may enhance blue luminosity of disk galaxies through SF phenomena. This last
statement is supported by the presence of strong FIR emission from early
spirals in this sample and by the high frequency of AGN/SB phenomenon, revealed
mainly in pairs of low relative radial velocity separation and showing signs of
interaction.",2006-05-05T09:02:52Z
"Standing Accretion Shocks in the Supernova Core: Effects of Convection
  and Realistic EOS","We investigated the structure of the spherically symmetric accretion flows
through the standing shock wave onto the proto-neutron star in the post-bounce
phase of the collapse-driven supernova. We assume that the accretion flow is in
a steady state controlled by the neutrino luminosity and mass accretion rate
that are kept constant. We obtain solutions of the steady Euler equations for a
wide range of neutrino luminosity and mass accretion rate. We employ a
realistic EOS and neutrino-heating rates. More importantly, we take into
account the effect of convection phenomenologically. For each mass accretion
rate, we find the critical neutrino luminosity, above which there exists no
steady solution. These critical points are supposed to mark the onset of the
shock revival. As the neutrino luminosity increases for a given mass accretion
rate, there appears a convectively unstable region at some point before the
critical value is reached. We introduce a phenomenological energy flux by
convection so that the negative entropy gradient should be canceled out. We
find that the convection lowers the critical neutrino luminosity substantially.
We also consider the effect of the self-gravity. It is found that the
self-gravity is important only when the neutrino luminosity is high. The
critical luminosity, however, is little affected if the energy transport by
convection is taken into account.",2006-06-21T02:25:44Z
"Extinction Columns and Intrinsic X-ray Spectra of the Anomalous X-ray
  Pulsars","The X-ray spectra of Anomalous X-ray Pulsars have long been fit by smooth,
empirical models such as the sum of a black-body plus a power law. These
reproduce the ~0.5 to 10 keV range well, but fail at lower and higher energies,
grossly over-predicting the optical and under-predicting the hard X-ray
emission. A poorly constrained source of uncertainty in determining the true,
intrinsic spectra, in particular at lower energies, is the amount of
interstellar extinction. In previous studies, extinction column densities with
small statistical errors were derived as part of the fits of the spectra to
simple continuum models. Different choices of model, however, each produced
statistically acceptable fits, but a wide range of columns. Here, we attempt to
measure the interstellar extinction in a model-independent way, using
individual absorption edges of the elements O, Fe, Ne, Mg and Si in X-ray
grating spectra taken with XMM-Newton. We find that our inferred equivalent
hydrogen column density NH for 4U 0142+61 is a factor of 1.4 lower than the
typically quoted value from black-body plus power-law fits, and is now
consistent with estimates based on the dust scattering halo and visual
extinction. For three other sources, we find column densities consistent with
earlier estimates. We use our measurements to recover the intrinsic spectra of
the AXPs empirically, without making assumptions on what the intrinsic spectral
shapes ought to be. We find that the power-law components that dominate at
higher energies do not extend below the thermal peak.",2006-06-23T21:55:21Z
Talk about Pivots,"We consider two different methods of parameterizing the dark energy equation
of state in order to assess possible ``figures of merit'' for evaluating dark
energy experiments. The two models are $w(a) = w_0 + (1-a)w_a$ and $w(a) = w_p
+ (a_p - a)w_a$. This brief note shows that the size of the error contours
cannot change under such a reparameterization. This makes the figures of merit
associated with these parameterizations mathematically identical. This also
means that any ``bias'' exhibited by one model is equally present in the other.",2006-04-19T19:24:16Z
"Are Diffuse High Energy Neutrinos and Gamma-Rays from Starburst Galaxies
  Observable?","Loeb and Waxman have argued that high energy neutrinos from the decay of
pions produced in interactions of cosmic rays with interstellar gas in
starburst galaxies would be produced with a large enough flux to be observable.
Their model is reexamined here and we obtain an upper limit to the diffuse
neutrino flux from starburst galaxies. The upper limit obtained here is a
factor of ~5 lower than the flux which they predict. Our predicted neutrino
flux would be below the atmospheric neutrino foreground flux at energies below
\~300 TeV and therefore would be unobservable. PeV neutrinos from starburst
galaxies are also unlikely to be detected. Compared with predicted fluxes from
other extragalactic high energy neutrino sources, starburst neutrinos with ~PeV
energies would have a flux considerably below that predicted for AGN models. We
also estimate an upper limit for the diffuse GeV gamma-ray flux from starburst
galaxies to be about two orders of magnitude below the observed gamma-ray
background, much less than the background from blazars and more than an order
of magnitude below that calculated by Thompson et al.",2006-07-10T15:50:01Z

Implications of WMAP 3 Year Data for the Sources of Reionization,"New results on the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and
its polarization based on the first 3 years of data from the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) have revised the electron scattering optical
depth downward from tau_es=0.17+0.08-0.07 to tau_es=0.09+/-0.03. This implies a
shift of the effective reionization redshift from z_r~17 to z_r~11. Previous
attempts to explain the high redshift of reionization inferred from the WMAP 1
year data have led to widespread speculation that the sources of reionization
must have been much more efficient than those associated with the star
formation observed at low redshift. This is consistent, for example, with the
suggestion that early star formation involved massive, Population III stars
that early on produced most of the ionizing radiation escaping from halos. It
is therefore tempting to interpret the new WMAP results as implying that we can
now relax those previous high demands on the efficiency of the sources of
reionization and perhaps even turn the argument around as evidence against such
high efficiency. We show that this is not the case, however. The new WMAP
results also find that the primordial density fluctuation power spectrum has a
lower amplitude, sigma_8, and departs substantially from the scale-invariant
spectrum. We show that these effects combine to cancel the impact of the later
reionization implied by the new value of tau_es on the required ionizing
efficiency per collapsed baryon. The delay of reionization is surprisingly well
matched by a comparable delay (by a factor of ~1.4 in scale factor) in the
formation of the halos responsible for reionization.",2006-04-20T20:48:57Z

"Solar-like oscillations in the metal-poor subgiant nu Indi: constraining
  the mass and age using asteroseismology","Asteroseismology is a powerful method for determining fundamental properties
of stars. We report the first application to a metal-poor object, namely the
subgiant star nu Ind. We measured precise velocities from two sites, allowing
us to detect oscillations and infer a large frequency separation of Delta_nu =
24.25 +/- 0.25 microHz. Combining this value with the location of the star in
the H-R diagram and comparing with standard evolutionary models, we were able
to place constraints on the stellar parameters. In particular, our results
indicate that nu Ind has a low mass (0.85 +/- 0.04 M_sun) and is at least 9 Gyr
old.",2006-04-21T03:51:44Z
The Spectroscopic Properties of Bright Extragalactic Planetary Nebulae,"The properties of bright extragalactic planetary nebulae are reviewed based
upon the results of low and high resolution spectroscopy. It is argued that
bright extragalactic planetary nebulae from galaxies (or subsystems) with and
without star formation have different distributions of central star temperature
and ionization structure. As regards the chemical compositions, oxygen and neon
are generally found to be unchanged as a result of the evolution of the stellar
progenitors. Nitrogen enrichment may occur as a result of the evolution of the
progenitors of bright planetary nebulae in all stellar populations, though this
enrichment may be (more) random in old stellar populations. Helium abundances
appear to be influenced by the chemical evolution of the host galaxy, with
planetary nebulae in dwarf spheroidals having systematically elevated
abundances. Neither the age nor the metallicity of the progenitor stellar
population has a strong effect upon the kinematics observed for nebular shells.
Both the range of expansion velocites, 8-28 km/s, and the typical expansion
velocity, ~18 km/s, are found to be relatively constant in all galaxies. On the
other hand, bright planetary nebulae in the bulge of M31 have systematically
higher expansion velocities than their counterparts in M31's disk. The
expansion velocities show no trend with nebular Hbeta luminosity, apart from a
lack of large expansion velocities at the highest luminosities (the youngest
objects), but appear to correlate with the 5007/Hbeta ratio, at least until
this ratio saturates. These results suggest a link between the evolution of the
nebular shells and central stars of bright extragalactic planetary nebulae.",2006-05-15T07:02:28Z
"Measurements and analysis of helium-like triplet ratios in the X-ray
  spectra of O-type stars","We discuss new methods of measuring and interpreting the
forbidden-to-intercombination line ratios of helium-like triplets in the X-ray
spectra of O-type stars, including accounting for the spatial distribution of
the X-ray emitting plasma and using the detailed photospheric UV spectrum.
Measurements are made for four O stars using archival Chandra HETGS data. We
assume an X-ray emitting plasma spatially distributed in the wind above some
minimum radius R_0. We find minimum radii of formation typically in the range
of 1.25 < R_0 / R_* < 1.67, which is consistent with results obtained
independently from line profile fits. We find no evidence for anomalously low
f/i ratios and we do not require the existence of X-ray emitting plasmas at
radii that are too small to generate sufficiently strong shocks.",2006-06-15T04:28:36Z
Accretion models of Sgr A*,"The supermassive black hole in the center of our Galaxy, Sgr A*, is unique
because the angular size of the black hole is the largest in the sky thus
providing detailed boundary conditions on, and much less freedom for, accretion
flow models. In this paper I review advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF;
another name is radiatively inefficient accretion flow) models for Sgr A*. This
includes the developments and dynamics of ADAFs, and how to explain
observational results including the multi-waveband spectrum, radio
polarization, IR and X-ray flares, and the size measurements at radio
wavebands.",2006-07-07T02:35:29Z
Planetary Nebula Velocities in the Disk and Bulge of M31,"We present radial velocities for a sample of 723 planetary nebulae (PNe) in
the disk and bulge of M31, measured using the WYFFOS fibre spectrograph on the
William Herschel telescope. Velocities are determined using the [OIII] 5007
Angstrom emission line. Rotation and velocity dispersion are measured to a
radius of 50 arcminutes (11.5 kpc), the first stellar rotation curve and
velocity dispersion profile for M31 to such a radius. Our kinematics are
consistent with rotational support at radii well beyond the bulge effective
radius of 1.4kpc, although our data beyond a radius of 5kpc are limited. We
present tentative evidence for kinematic substructure in the bulge of M31 to be
studied fully in a later work. This paper is part of an ongoing project to
constrain the total mass, mass distribution and velocity anisotropy of the
disk, bulge and halo of M31.",2006-03-26T12:52:05Z
"A Survey of Kiloparsec-Scale Radio Outflows in Radio-Quiet Active
  Galactic Nuclei","Seyfert galaxies commonly host compact jets spanning 10-100 pc scales, but
larger structures (KSRs) are resolved out in long baseline, aperture synthesis
surveys. We report a new, short baseline Very Large Array (VLA) survey of a
complete sample of Seyfert and LINER galaxies. Out of all of the surveyed
radio-quiet sources, we find that 44% (19 / 43) show extended radio structures
at least 1 kpc in total extent that do not match the morphology of the disk or
its associated star-forming regions. The KSR Seyferts stand out by deviating
significantly from the far-infrared - radio correlation for star-forming
galaxies, and they are more likely to have a relatively luminous, compact radio
source in the nucleus; these results argue that KSRs are powered by the AGN
rather than starburst. KSRs probably originate from jet plasma that has been
decelerated by interaction with the nuclear ISM. We demonstrate the jet loses
virtually all of its power to the ISM within the inner kiloparsec to form the
slow KSRs.",2006-04-10T20:08:54Z
"New symmetries in microphysics, new stable forms of matter around us","Extension of particle symmetry implies new conserved charges and the lightest
particles, possessing such charges, should be stable. Created in early
Universe, stable charged heavy leptons and quarks can exist and, hidden in
elusive atoms bound by Coulomb attraction, can play the role of dark matter.
The problem of this scenario is that in the expanding Universe it is not
possible to recombine all the charged particles into elusive ""atoms"", and
positively charged particles, which escape such recombination, bind with
electrons in atoms of anomalous isotopes with pregalactic abundance, generally
exceeding terrestrial upper limits. Realistic scenarios of composite dark
matter, avoiding this problem of anomalous isotope over-production, inevitably
predict the existence of primordial ""atoms"", in which primordial helium traps
all the free negatively charged heavy constituents with charge -2. Study of the
possibility for such primordial heavy alpha-particle with compensated charge to
exist as well as the search for the stable charged constituents in cosmic rays
and accelerators provide crucial test for the new forms of stable matter.",2006-07-04T11:28:41Z
"Minkowski's Object: A Starburst Triggered by a Radio Jet, Revisited","We present neutral hydrogen, ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared imaging,
and optical spectroscopy, of Minkowski's Object (MO), a star forming peculiar
galaxy near NGC 541. The observations strengthen evidence that star formation
in MO was triggered by the radio jet from NGC 541. Key new results are the
discovery of a 4.9E8 solar mass double HI cloud straddling the radio jet
downstream from MO, where the jet changes direction and decollimates; strong
detections of MO, also showing double structure, in UV and H-alpha; and
numerous HII regions and associated clusters in MO. In UV, MO resembles the
radio-aligned, rest-frame UV morphologies in many high redshift radio galaxies
(HzRGs), also thought to be caused by jet-induced star formation. MO's stellar
population is dominated by a 7.5 Myr-old, 1.9E7 solar mass instantaneous burst,
with current star formation rate 0.52 solar masses per year (concentrated
upstream from where the HI column density is high). This is unlike the
jet-induced star formation in Centaurus A, where the jet interacts with
pre-existing cold gas; in MO the HI may have cooled out of a warmer, clumpy
intergalactic or interstellar medium as a result of jet interaction, followed
by collapse of the cooling clouds and subsequent star formation (consistent
with numerical simulations). Since the radio source that triggered star
formation in MO is much less luminous, and therefore more common, than powerful
HzRGs, and because the environment around MO is not particularly special in
terms of abundant dense, cold gas, jet-induced star formation in the early
universe might be even more prevalent than previously thought.",2006-04-27T00:45:37Z
"The Host Galaxies of Narrow-Line Seyfert 1s: Nuclear Dust Morphology and
  Starburst Rings","We present a study of the nuclear morphology of a sample of narrow- and
broad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1's and BLS1's) based on broad-band images in
the Hubble Space Telescope archives. In our previous study, we found that
large-scale stellar bars at > 1 kpc from the nucleus are more common in NLS1's
than BLS1's. In this paper we find that NLS1's preferentially have grand-design
dust spirals within approx. 1 kpc of their centers. We also find that NLS1's
have a higher fraction of nuclear star-forming rings than BLS1's. We find that
many of the morphological differences are due to the presence or absence of a
large-scale stellar bar within the spiral host galaxy. In general, barred
Seyfert 1s tend to have grand-design dust spirals at their centers, confirming
the results of other researchers. The high fraction of grand-design nuclear
dust spirals and stellar nuclear rings observed in NLS1's host galaxies
suggests a means for efficient fueling of their nuclei to support their high
Eddington ratios.",2006-03-29T22:43:01Z
Dispersal of Gaseous Circumstellar Discs around High-Mass Stars,"We study the dispersal of a gaseous disc surrounding a central high-mass
stellar core once this circumstellar disc becomes fully ionized. If the stellar
and surrounding EUV and X-ray radiations are so strong as to rapidly heat up
and ionize the entire circumstellar disc as further facilitated by disc
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, a shock can be driven to travel outward
in the fully ionized disc, behind which the disc expands and thins. For an
extremely massive and powerful stellar core, the ionized gas pressure
overwhelms the centrifugal and gravitational forces in the disc. In this limit,
we construct self-similar shock solutions for such an expansion and depletion
phase. As a significant amount of circumstellar gas being removed, the relic
disc becomes vulnerable to strong stellar winds and fragments into clumps. We
speculate that disc disappearance happens rapidly, perhaps on a timescale of
$\sim 10^3-10^4\hbox{yr}$ once the disc becomes entirely ionized sometime after
the onset of thermal nuclear burning in a high-mass stellar core.",2006-05-19T17:29:32Z
"SN 2005cs in M51 I. The first month of evolution of a subluminous SN II
  plateau","Early time optical observations of supernova (SN) 2005cs in the Whirlpool
Galaxy (M51), are reported. Photometric data suggest that SN 2005cs is a
moderately under-luminous Type II plateau supernova (SN IIP). The SN was
unusually blue at early epochs (U-B ~ -0.9 about three days after explosion)
which indicates very high continuum temperatures. The spectra show relatively
narrow P-Cygni features, suggesting ejecta velocities lower than observed in
more typical SNe IIP. The earliest spectra show weak absorption features in the
blue wing of the He I 5876A absorption component and, less clearly, of H$\beta$
and H$\alpha$. Based on spectral modelling, two different interpretations can
be proposed: these features may either be due to high-velocity H and He I
components, or (more likely) be produced by different ions (N II, Si II).
Analogies with the low-luminosity, $^{56}$Ni-poor, low-velocity SNe IIP are
also discussed.
  While a more extended spectral coverage is necessary in order to determine
accurately the properties of the progenitor star, published estimates of the
progenitor mass seem not to be consistent with stellar evolution models.",2006-05-29T15:52:54Z
"The Star Formation Histories of the Bulge and Disk of M31 from Gemini
  North+NIRI/Altair and HST/NICMOS","We discuss H and K observations of three fields in the bulge and disk of M31
obtained with the Altair adaptive optics system and NIRI instrument on Gemini
North. These are the highest resolution and deepest near-infrared observations
obtained to date of the inner regions of M31, and demonstrate the promise of
ground-based adaptive optics for studying the crowded regions of nearby
galaxies. We have combined our observations with previously published
HST/NICMOS observations of nine M31 fields and have derived the coarse star
formation histories of M31's bulge and inner disk. From fits to the M_K
luminosity functions, we find the stellar population mix to be dominated by
old, nearly solar-metallicity stars. The old populations, which we define as
having age >~6 Gyr, indeed dominate the star formation histories at all radii
independent of the relative contributions of bulge and disk stars. Although all
of our fields contain some bulge contribution, our results suggest that there
is no age difference between the bulge and disk to the limit of our precision.",2006-03-29T15:38:48Z
Discovery of an 86 AU Radius Debris Ring Around HD 181327,"HST/NICMOS PSF-subtracted coronagraphic observations of HD 181327 have
revealed the presence of a ring-like disk of circumstellar debris seen in 1.1
micron light scattered by the disk grains, surrounded by a di use outer region
of lower surface brightness. The annular disk appears to be inclined by 31.7
+/- 1.6 deg from face on with the disk major axis PA at 107 +/-2 deg . The
total 1.1 micron flux density of the light scattered by the disk (at 1.2"" < r <
5.0"") of 9.6 mJy +/- 0.8 mJy is 0.17% +/- 0.015% of the starlight. Seventy
percent of the light from the scattering grains appears to be confined in a 36
AU wide annulus centered on the peak of the radial surface brightness (SB)
profile 86.3 +/- 3.9 AU from the star, well beyond the characteristic radius of
thermal emission estimated from IRAS and Spitzer flux densities assuming
blackbody grains (~ 22 AU). The light scattered by the ring appears bilaterally
symmetric, exhibits directionally preferential scattering well represented by a
Henyey-Greenstein scattering phase function with g = 0.30 +/- 0.03, and has an
azimuthally medianed SB at the 86.3 AU radius of peak SB of 1.00 +/- 0.07 mJy
arcsec^-2. No photocentric offset is seen in the ring relative to the position
of the central star. A low surface brightness diffuse halo is seen in the
NICMOS image to a distance of ~ 4"" Deeper 0.6 micron HST/ACS PSF-subtracted
coronagraphic observations reveal a faint outer nebulosity, asymmetrically
brighter to the North of the star. We discuss models of the disk and properties
of its grains, from which we infer a maximum vertical scale height of 4 - 8 AU
at the 87.6 AU radius of maximum surface density, and a total maximum dust mass
of collisionally replenished grains with minimum grain sizes of ~ 1 micron of ~
4 M(moon).",2006-06-08T20:52:04Z
"Basic considerations about experimental approaches to the B-mode of the
  CMB Polarization","The B-mode detection of Cosmic Microwave Background polarization will require
new technological developments, able to get sensitivities at least 2 orders of
magnitude better than for the E-mode. This really ambitious goal cannot be
reached simply by either improving the present technology or by adding more
detectors to current design, at least in the frame of having a new space
mission operating within a decade. Thus, the scientific community have to take
important decisions about the most suitable technologies on which converge the
needed effort. Basically, at present two receiver families do exist: bolometric
and radiometric. Both of them are continuoulsly improving their basic
performances, but the optimal approach to B-modes may require some decisions
have to be taken in short time scale. In any case, radiometric and bolometric
receivers have to deal with some common sources of systematics as well as they
both require some cryogenics. Thus, we should expect that systematics and
cryogenics may play as watershed line in designing future experiments aimed at
measuring the B-mode of Cosmic Microwave Background.",2006-04-07T15:56:08Z
"Spectral Statistics and Local Luminosity Function of a Hard X-ray
  Complete Sample of Brightest AGNs","We have measured the X-ray spectral properties of a complete flux-limited
sample of bright AGNs from HEAO-1 all-sky catalogs to investigate their
statistics and provide greater constraints on the bright-end of the hard X-ray
luminosity function (HXLF) of AGNs and the AGN population synthesis model of
the X-ray background. Spectral studies using data from ASCA, XMM-Newton and/or
Beppo-SAX observations have been made for almost all AGNs in this sample.
  The spectral measurements enable us to construct the neutral absorbing column
density (Log nH) distribution and separate HXLFs for absorbed (Log nH[cm-2]>
21.5) and unabsorbed AGNs in the local universe. Our results show evidence for
a difference in the shapes of HXLFs of absorbed and unabsorbed AGNs in that
absorbed AGN HXLF drops more rapidly at higher luminosities than that of
unabsorbed AGNs, which is similar to that previously reported. In the Lx - nH
plot, we found no AGN in the high-luminosity high-intrinsic absorption regime
(Log Lx[erg/s]> 44.5, Log nH[cm-2]> 21.5) in our sample, where we expect about
5 AGNs if we assume that absorbed and unabsorbed having identical AGN HXLF
shapes. We also find that the observed flux with ASCA or XMM-Newton is smaller
than that with HEAO-1 by a factor of 0.29 on average, which is expected for
re-observation of sources with a factor 2.5 variability amplitude scale.",2006-03-25T12:59:12Z
The origin and fate of short-period low-mass black-hole binaries,"We present results of a population synthesis study for semidetached short
orbital period binaries which contain low-mass(<1.5 Msun) donors and black hole
(>4 Msun) accretors. Evolution of these binaries is determined by nuclear
evolution of the donors and/or orbital angular momentum loss due to magnetic
braking by the stellar wind of the donors and gravitational wave radiation.
According to our model, the estimated total number of this type of black-hole
binaries in the Galaxy is about 10000. If the magnetic braking is described by
the Verbunt & Zwaan formula, the model predicts around 3000 transient systems
with periods >2 hours and around 300 luminous stable systems with periods
between 3 and 8 hours. Several dozens of these bright systems should be above
the RXTE ASM sensitivity limit. The absence of such systems implies that
angular momentum losses are reduced by a factor more than 2 with respect to the
Verbunt & Zwaan prescription. We show that it is unlikely that the transient
behaviour of black-hole short-period X-ray binaries is explained by the evolved
nature of the stellar companion. A substantial fraction of black-hole binaries
with periods >3 hours could be faint with truncated, stable cold accretion
discs as proposed by Menou et al. Most of the semidetached black-hole binaries
are expected to have periods shorter than ~2 hours. Properties of such, still
to be observed, very small mass-ratio (q<0.02) binaries are different from
those of their longer period cousins.",2006-04-20T15:29:56Z
"Infrared SEDs of Seyfert Galaxies: Starbursts and the Nature of the
  Obscuring Medium","We present the results of IRS low-resolution spectroscopy of 51 Seyfert
galaxies, part of a large Spitzer observing program to determine the mid-to-far
infrared spectral energy distributions of a well-defined sample of 87 nearby,
12 micron-selected Seyferts. We find that the spectra clearly divide into
groups based on their continuum shapes and spectral features. The infrared
spectral types appear to be related to the Seyfert types. Some features are
clearly related to a starburst contribution to the IR spectrum, while the
observed power-law continuum shapes, attributed to the AGN, may be dust or
non-thermal emission. Principal component analysis results suggest that the
relative contribution of starburst emission is the dominant cause of variance
in the spectra. We find that the Sy 2's show on average stronger starburst
contributions than the Sy 1's.",2006-03-16T22:55:00Z
Exploring the spectroscopic diversity of Type Ia Supernovae,"The velocities and equivalent widths (EWs) of a set of absorption features
are measured for a sample of 28 well-observed Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia)
covering a wide range of properties. The values of these quantities at maximum
are obtained through interpolation/extrapolation and plotted against the
decline rate, and so are various line ratios. The SNe are divided according to
their velocity evolution into three classes defined in a previous work of
Benetti et al.: low velocity gradient (LVG), high velocity gradient (HVG) and
FAINT. It is found that all the LVG SNe have approximately uniform velocities
at B maximum, while the FAINT SNe have values that decrease with increasing
Delta m_15(B), and the HVG SNe have a large spread. The EWs of the Fe-dominated
features are approximately constant in all SNe, while those of Intermediate
mass element (IME) lines have larger values for intermediate decliners and
smaller values for brighter and FAINT SNe. The HVG SNe have stronger Si II
6355-A lines, with no correlation with Delta m_15(B). It is also shown that the
Si II 5972 A EW and three EW ratios, including one analogous to the R(Si II)
ratio introduced by Nugent et al., are good spectroscopic indicators of
luminosity. The data suggest that all LVG SNe have approximately constant
kinetic energy, since burning to IME extends to similar velocities. The FAINT
SNe may have somewhat lower energies. The large velocities and EWs of the IME
lines of HVG SNe appear correlated with each other, but are not correlated with
the presence of high-velocity features in the Ca II infrared triplet in the
earliest spectra for the SNe for which such data exist.",2006-04-21T17:43:36Z
"HST and Spitzer Observations of the Host Galaxy of GRB 050904: A
  Metal-Enriched, Dusty Starburst at z=6.295","We present deep Hubble Space Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope
observations of the host galaxy of GRB 050904 at z=6.295. The host is detected
in the H-band and marginally at 3.6 micron. From these detections, and limits
in the z'-band and 4.5 micron, we infer an extinction-corrected absolute
magnitude, M(UV)=-20.7 mag, or ~L*, a substantial star formation rate of 15
solar masses per year, and a stellar mass of a few 10^9 solar masses. A
comparison to the published sample of spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at
z>5.5 reveals that the host of GRB 050904 would evade detection and/or
confirmation in any of the current surveys due to the lack of detectable
Ly-alpha emission, which is likely the result of dust extinction (A[1200]~1.5
mag). This suggests that not all luminous starburst galaxies at z~6 are
currently being accounted for. Most importantly, using the metallicity of
Z~0.05 solar inferred from the afterglow absorption spectrum, our observations
indicate for the first time that the observed evolution in the mass- and
luminosity-metallicity relations from z=0 to z~2 continues on to z>6. The ease
of measuring redshifts and metallicities from the afterglow emission suggests
that in tandem with the next generation ground- and space-based telescopes, a
GRB mission with dedicated near-IR follow-up can provide unique information on
the evolution of stars and galaxies through the epoch of re-ionization.",2006-03-27T18:23:29Z
"A Very High Spectral Resolution Study of Ground-State OH Masers in
  W3(OH)","We present VLBA observations of the ground-state hydroxyl masers in W3(OH) at
0.02 km s-1 spectral resolution. Over 250 masers are detected, including 56
Zeeman pairs. Lineshapes are predominantly Gaussian or combinations of several
Gaussians, with normalized deviations typically of the same magnitude as in
masers in other species. Typical FWHM maser linewidths are 0.15 to 0.38 km s-1
and are larger in the 1665 MHz transition than in the other three ground-state
transitions. The satellite-line 1612 and 1720 MHz masers show no evidence of
sigma^+/-2,3 components. The spatial positions of most masers are seen to vary
across the line profile, with many spots showing clear, organized positional
gradients. Equivalent line-of-sight velocity gradients in the plane of the sky
typically range from 0.01 to 1 km s-1 AU-1 (i.e., positional gradients of 1 to
100 AU (km s-1)-1). Small velocity gradients in the 1667 MHz transition support
theoretical predictions that 1667 MHz masers appear in regions with small
velocity shifts along the amplification length. Deconvolved maser spot sizes
appear to be larger in the line wings but do not support a spherical maser
geometry.",2006-04-25T21:19:09Z
"On the Environmental Dependence of Galaxy Properties Established by the
  Initial Cosmological Conditions","We study theoretically how the initial cosmological conditions establish the
dependence of galaxy properties on the environment. First, we adopt the linear
tidal torque theory according to which the angular momentum of a proto-galaxy
is generated at first order by the misalignment between the proto-galaxy
inertia tensor and the local tidal tensor. Then, we quantify analytically the
degree of the misalignment between the two tensors, and show quantitatively
that it increases as the density of the environment decreases. It implies that
the proto-galaxies forming in the lower density regions should end up with
having higher angular momentum than those in the higher density regions, which
is consistent with recent numerical finding that the void and field galaxies
have higher spin parameters than the cluster galaxies. Since the galaxy angular
momentum plays a role of developing a disk-like structure and hindering the
star-formation, our theoretical insight provides an answer to such fundamental
observational question as why the large void galaxies have young stellar
populations and high specific star formation rate, which was not explained by
the previous morphology-density relation.",2006-04-03T02:41:25Z
Vlbi Diagnostics of Jet Instabilities in 0836+710,"In this paper, we present new VLBA observations of the radio jet in the
quasar S5 0836+710 at 8 and 22 GHz. The identification of the ridge lines allow
us to interpret the jet structure in terms of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.
Combined with previous epochs of VLBA and VSOP data at 1.6 and 5 GHz, these new
observations will allow us to study the evolution of the instabilities in the
jet. We have detected signatures of possible jet disruption in the jet due to
the growth of instabilities, which points towards a possible morphological
classification of the source as an FRI, contrary to what previously thought in
terms of luminosity criteria.",2006-07-17T14:49:49Z
Intergalactic medium heating by dark matter,"We derive the evolution of the energy deposition in the intergalactic medium
(IGM) by dark matter (DM) decays/annihilations for both sterile neutrinos and
light dark matter (LDM) particles. At z > 200 sterile neutrinos transfer a
fraction f_abs~0.5 of their rest mass energy into the IGM; at lower redshifts
this fraction becomes <~ 0.3 depending on the particle mass. The LDM particles
can decay or annihilate. In both cases f_abs~0.4-0.9 at high (> 300) redshift,
dropping to ~0.1 below z=100. These results indicate that the impact of DM
decays/annihilations on the IGM thermal and ionization history is less
important than previously thought. We find that sterile neutrinos (LDM) decays
are able to increase the IGM temperature by z=5 at most up to 4K (100K), about
50-200 times less than predicted by estimates based on the assumption of
complete energy transfer to the gas.",2006-06-20T14:14:11Z
"Fe-bump instability: the excitation of pulsations in subdwarf B and
  other low-mass stars","We consider the excitation of radial and non-radial oscillations in low-mass
B stars by the iron-bump opacity mechanism. The results are significant for the
interpretation of pulsations in subdwarf B stars, helium-rich subdwarfs and
extreme helium stars, including the EC14026 and PG1716 variables. We
demonstrate that, for radial oscillations, the driving mechanism becomes
effective by increasing the contrast between the iron-bump opacity and the
opacity from other sources. The location of the iron-bump instability boundary
depends on the mean molecular weight in the envelope and also on the radial
order of the oscillation. A bluer instability boundary is provided by
increasing the iron abundance alone, explaining the observed EC14026 variables,
and by higher radial order oscillations. We show that the coolest EC14026
variables may vary in the fundamental radial mode, but the hottest variables
must be of higher radial order. In considering non-radial oscillations, we
demonstrate that g-modes of high radial order and low spherical degree (l<4)
may be excited in some blue horizontal branch stars with near-normal
composition (Z=0.02). Additional iron enhancement extends the g-mode
instability zone to higher effective temperatures and also creates a p-mode
instability zone. With sufficient iron, the p-mode and g-mode instability zones
overlap, allowing a small region where the EC14026 and PG1716-type variability
can be excited simultaneously. However its location is roughly 5000 K too low
compared with the observed boundary between EC14026 and PG1716 variables.",2006-06-23T16:24:21Z
Associations of Dwarf Galaxies,"Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Cameras for Surveys has been used to
determine accurate distances for 20 galaxies from measurements of the
luminosity of the brightest red giant branch stars. Five associations of dwarf
galaxies that had originally been identified based on strong correlations on
the plane of the sky and in velocity are shown to be equally well correlated in
distance. Two more associations with similar properties have been discovered.
Another association is identified that is suggested to be unbound through tidal
disruption. The associations have the spatial and kinematic properties expected
of bound structures with 1 - 10 x 10^11 solar mass. However, these entities
have little light with the consequence that mass-to-light ratios are in the
range 100 - 1000 in solar units. Within a well surveyed volume extending to 3
Mpc, all but one known galaxy lies within one of the groups or associations
that have been identified.",2006-03-15T02:48:05Z
"Loki, Io: New groundbased observations and a model describing the change
  from periodic overturn","Loki Patera is the most powerful volcano in the solar system. We have
obtained measurements of Loki's 3.5 micron brightness from NASA's Infrared
Telescope Facility (IRTF) and have witnessed a change from the periodic
behavior previously noted. While Loki brightened by a factor of several every
540 days prior to 2001, from 2001 through 2004 Loki remained at a constant,
medium brightness. We have constructed a quantitative model of Loki as a
basaltic lava lake whose solidified crust overturns when it becomes buoyantly
unstable. By altering the speed at which the overturn propagates across the
patera, we can match our groundbased brightness data. In addition, we can match
other data taken at other times and wavelengths. By slowing the propagation
speed dramatically, we can match the observations from 2001-2004. This slowing
may be due to a small change in volatile content in the magma.",2006-05-09T20:02:58Z
Compact X-ray Binaries in and out of Core Collapsed Globulars,"We review new Chandra and HST observations of the core collapsed cluster NGC
6397 as a guide to understanding the compact binary (CB) populations in core
collapse globulars. New cataclysmic variables (CVs) and main sequence
chromospherically active binaries (ABs) have been identified, enabling a larger
sample for comparison of the Lx, Fx/Fv and X-ray vs. optical color
distributions. Comparison of the numbers of CBs with Lx >10^31 erg/s in 4 core
collapse vs. 12 King model clusters reveals that the specific frequency Sx
(number of CBs per unit cluster mass) is enhanced in core collapse clusters,
even when normalized for their stellar encounter rate. Although core collapse
is halted by the dynamical heating due to stellar (and binary) interaction with
CBs in the core, we conclude that production of the hardest CBs -- especially
CVs -- is enhanced during core collapse. NGC 6397 has its most luminous CVs
nearest the cluster center, with two newly discovered very low luminosity (old,
quiescent) CVs far from the core. The active binaries as well as neutron star
systems (MSP and qLMXB) surround the central core. The overall CB population
appears to be asymmetric about the cluster center, as in several other core
collapse clusters observed with Chandra, suggesting still poorly-understood
scattering processes.",2006-05-04T19:26:32Z
Galaxies in front of Quasars: Mrk 1456 and SDSS J114719.90+522923.2,"The chance projection of the disk of Mrk~1456 onto a background QSO is
similar to the case of SBS 1543+593/HS 1543+5921. Mrk~1456 is a luminous,
late-type spiral at z ~ 0.05. Though the QSO, SDSS J114719.90+522923.2 at z ~
2, has not yet been observed with ultraviolet spectroscopy, it shows strong Ca
II absorption at the redshift of Mrk 1456 which gives evidence that it is a
possible Damped Lyman Alpha absorber. Spectroscopy of the star-forming nucleus
of Mrk~1456 allows us to apply emission-line diagnostics to infer the chemical
abundances at the center of the galaxy, and to make a prediction of the
expected metallicity on the sightline to the QSO.",2006-07-17T14:33:36Z
E- and B-mode mixing from incomplete knowledge of the shear correlation,"Aims. We quantify the mixing of the measured cosmic-shear E- and B-modes
caused by the lack of shear-correlation measurements on small and large scales,
arising from a lack of close projected galaxy pairs and the finite field size,
respectively.
  Methods. We calculate the aperture-mass statistics <M_{ap, perp}^2> and the
E-/B-mode shear-correlation functions xi_{E, B +/-} where small- and
large-scale cutoffs are taken into account. We assess the deviation of the
obtained E-mode to the true E-mode and the introduction of a spurious B-mode.
  Results. The measured aperture-mass dispersion is underestimated by more than
10% on scales smaller than 12 times the lower cutoff. For a precise measurement
of the E- and B-modes at the percent level using a combination of xi_{E, B +}
and xi_{E, B -}, a field as large as 7 (2.4) degrees is necessary for
ground-based (space-based) observations.",2006-04-25T14:38:32Z
"Early-type stars in the young open cluster IC1805. II. The probably
  single stars HD15570 and HD15629, and the massive binary/triple system
  HD15558","Aims: We address the issue of the multiplicity of the three brightest
early-type stars of the young open cluster IC1805, namely HD15570, HD15629 and
HD15558. Methods: For the three stars, we measured the radial velocity by
fitting Gaussian curves to line profiles in the optical domain. In the case of
the massive binary HD15558, we also used a spectral disentangling method to
separate the spectra of the primary and of the secondary in order to derive the
radial velocities of the two components. These measurements were used to
compute orbital solutions for HD15558. Results: For HD15570 and HD15629, the
radial velocities do not present any significant trend attributable to a binary
motion on time scales of a few days, nor from one year to the next. In the case
of HD15558 we obtained an improved SB1 orbital solution with a period of about
442 days, and we report for the first time on the detection of the spectral
signature of its secondary star. We derive spectral types O5.5III(f) and O7V
for the primary and the secondary of HD15558. We tentatively compute a first
SB2 orbital solution although the radial velocities from the secondary star
should be considered with caution. The mass ratio is rather high, i.e. about 3,
and leads to very extreme minimum masses, in particular for the primary object.
Minimum masses of the order of 150 \pm 50 and 50 \pm 15 M_\odot are found
respectively for the primary and the secondary. Conclusions: We propose that
HD15558 could be a triple system. This scenario could help to reconcile the
very large minimum mass derived for the primary object with its spectral type.
In addition, considering new and previously published results, we find that the
binary frequency among O-stars in IC1805 has a lower limit of 20%, and that
previously published values (80%) are probably overestimated.",2006-06-15T13:25:25Z
"Dust Extinction of Gamma-ray Burst Host Galaxies: Identification of Two
  Classes?","Dust in the host galaxies of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) dims and reddens their
afterglow spectra. Knowledge of the nature of this dust is crucial for
correcting for extinction, providing clues to the nature of GRB progenitors,
and probing the interstellar medium of high-redshift galaxies as well as the
nature of cosmic dust when the universe was much younger and galaxies were much
less evolved. The dust and extinction properties of GRB host galaxies are still
poorly known. Unlike previous work, we derive in this Letter the extinction
curves for 10 GRB host galaxies without a priori assumption of any specific
extinction types (such as that of the Milky Way, or the Small/Large Magellanic
Clouds). It is found that there appears to exist two different types of
extinction curves: one is relatively flat and gray, the other displays a
steeper dependence on inverse wavelength, closely resembling that of the Milky
Way but with the 2175$\Angstrom$ feature removed.",2006-03-09T05:56:09Z
"A search for kilogauss magnetic fields in white dwarfs and hot subdwarf
  stars","We present new results of a survey for weak magnetic fields among DA white
dwarfs with inclusion of some brighter hot subdwarf stars. We have detected
variable circular polarization in the Halpha line of the hot subdwarf star
Feige 34 (SP: sdO). From these data, we estimate that the longitudinal magnetic
field of this star varies from -1.1 +/- 3.2 kG to +9.6 +/- 2.6 kG, with a mean
of about +5 kG and a period longer than 2 h. In this study, we also confirm the
magnetic nature of white dwarf WD1105-048 and present upper limits of kilogauss
longitudinal magnetic fields of 5 brightest DA white dwarfs. Our data support
recent finding that 25% of white dwarfs have kilogauss magnetic fields. This
frequency also confirms results of early estimates obtained using the magnetic
field function of white dwarfs.",2006-05-16T21:33:37Z
"Avoiding the Big-Rip Jeopardy in a Quintom Dark Energy Model with Higher
  Derivatives","In the framework of a single scalar field quintom model with higher
derivative, we construct in this paper a dark energy model of which the
equation of state (EOS) $w$ crosses over the cosmological constant boundary.
Interestingly during the evolution of the universe $w<-1$ happens just for a
period of time with a distinguished feature that $w$ starts with a value above
-1, transits into $w<-1$, then comes back to $w>-1$. This avoids the Big Rip
jeopardy induced by $w<-1$.",2006-03-30T16:26:14Z
Radio-Excess IRAS Galaxies: IV. Optical Spectroscopy,"This is the fourth in our series of papers investigating radio-excess
galaxies, which have radio emission associated with an active nucleus but which
do not fit into the traditional categories of either radio-loud or radio-quiet
active galaxies. In this paper, we present optical spectra of our sample of
FIR-luminous radio-excess galaxies. Optical emission line diagnostics are used
to determine the dominant source of the ionizing radiation. We find that radio
excess is an excellent indicator of the presence of an active nucleus: the
radio-excess sample contains a much higher fraction of AGN than samples
selected on FIR luminosity alone, or using other criteria such as warm FIR
colors. Several objects have ambiguous classifications and are likely to be
composite objects with mixed excitation. The type of optical spectrum appears
to be associated with the radio-loudness: radio-loud objects may be more `pure'
AGN than radio-intermediate objects. We find strong evidence for interaction
between the radio plasma and the surrounding gas. The jet energy fluxes of the
radio-excess objects, inferred from the [O III] luminosities, are lower than in
powerful radio sources, consistent with our previous results. We conclude that
the jets of radio-intermediate sources are intrinsically weaker than those in
sources with more powerful radio emission. A significant fraction of the sample
spectra show post-starburst stellar continuum, with A-star absorption lines,
consistent with the large fraction of merging or disturbed host galaxies in the
sample. The ages of the radio sources are significantly less than those of A
stars indicating that, if the radio sources are associated with merging
activity, there is a delay between the interaction and the initiation of the
radio activity. (Abridged.)",2006-04-21T20:46:08Z
"Modelling the closest double degenerate system RXJ0806.3+1527 and its
  decreasing period","In the hypothesis that the 5.4m binary RXJ0806.3+1527 consists of a low mass
helium white dwarf (donor) transferring mass towards its more massive white
dwarf companion (primary), we consider as possible donors white dwarfs which
are the result of common envelope evolution occurring when the helium core mass
of the progenitor giant was still very small (~ 0.2Msun), so that they are
surrounded by a quite massive hydrogen envelope (~1/100Msun or larger), and
live for a very long time supported by proton--proton burning. Mass transfer
from such low mass white dwarfs very probably starts during the hydrogen
burning stage, and the donor structure will remain dominated by the burning
shell until it loses all the hydrogen envelope and begins transferring helium.
We model mass transfer from these low mass white dwarfs, and show that the
radius of the donor decreases while they shed the hydrogen envelope. This
radius behavior, which is due to the fact that the white dwarf is not fully
degenerate, has two important consequences on the evolution of the binary: 1)
the orbital period decreases, with a timescale consistent with the period
decrease of the binary RXJ0806.3+1527; 2) the mass transfer rate is a factor of
about 10 smaller than from a fully degenerate white dwarf, easing the problem
connected with the small X-ray luminosity of this object. The possibility that
such evolution describes the system RXJ0806.3+1527 is also consistent with the
possible presence of hydrogen in the optical spectrum of the star, whose
confirmation would become a test of the model.",2006-06-23T06:18:04Z
Bulk viscosity of Mixed nucleon-hyperon-quark Matter in Neutron stars,"We calculate the coefficient of bulk viscosity by considering the
non-leptonic weak interactions in the cores of hybrid stars with both hyperons
and quarks. We first determine the dependence of the production rate of
neutrons on the reaction rate of quarks in the non-leptonic processes, that is
$\Gamma_{n}=K_{s}\Gamma_{s}+\Gamma_{\Lambda}+2\Gamma_{\Sigma^{-}}$. The
conversion rate, $K_{s}$ in our scenario is a complicated function of baryon
number density. We also consider medium effect of quark matter on bulk
viscosity. Using these results, we estimate the limiting rotation of the hybrid
stars, which may suppress the r-mode instability more effectively. Hybrid stars
should be the candidates for the extremely rapid rotators .",2006-07-04T14:07:22Z
Is the SMC Bound to the LMC? The HST Proper Motion of the SMC,"We present a measurement of the systemic proper motion of the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC) made using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on the
\textit{Hubble Space Telescope} (\textit{HST}). We tracked the SMC's motion
relative to 4 background QSOs over a baseline of approximately 2 years. The
measured proper motion is : $\mu_W = -1.16 \pm 0.18 \masyr, \mu_N = -1.17 \pm
0.18 \masyr$. This is the best measurement yet of the SMC's proper motion. We
combine this new result with our prior estimate of the proper motion of the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) from the same observing program to investigate the
orbital evolution of both Clouds over the past 9 Gyr. The current relative
velocity between the Clouds is $105 \pm 42 \kms$. Our investigations of the
past orbital motions of the Clouds in a simple model for the dark halo of the
Milky Way imply that the Clouds could be unbound from each other. However, our
data are also consistent with orbits in which the Clouds have been bound to
each other for approximately a Hubble time. Smaller proper motion errors and
better understanding of the LMC and SMC masses would be required to constrain
their past orbital history and their bound vs. unbound nature unambiguously.
The new proper motion measurements should be sufficient to allow the
construction of improved models for the origin and properties of the Magellanic
Stream. In turn, this will provide new constraints on the properties of the
Milky Way dark halo.",2006-06-09T17:44:00Z
Producing ultra-strong magnetic fields in neutron star mergers,"We report an extremely rapid mechanism for magnetic field amplification
during the merger of a binary neutron star system. This has implications for
the production of the short class of Gamma-Ray Bursts, which recent
observations suggest may originate in such mergers. In detailed
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the merger process, the fields are amplified
via Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities beyond magnetar field strength and may
therefore represent the strongest magnetic fields in the Universe. The
amplification occurs in the shear layer which forms between the neutron stars
and on a time scale of only 1 millisecond, i.e. long before the remnant can
collapse into a black hole.",2006-03-31T08:51:57Z
Near Scale Invariance with Modified Dispersion Relations,"We describe a novel mechanism to seed a nearly scale invariant spectrum of
adiabatic perturbations during a non-inflationary stage. It relies on a
modified dispersion relation that contains higher powers of the spatial
momentum of matter perturbations. We implement this idea in the context of a
massless scalar field in an otherwise perfectly homogeneous universe. The
couplings of the field to background scalars and tensors give rise to the
required modification of its dispersion relation, and the couplings of the
scalar to matter result in an adiabatic primordial spectrum. This work is meant
to explicitly illustrate that it is possible to seed nearly scale invariant
primordial spectra without inflation, within a conventional expansion history.",2006-06-07T19:53:38Z
"Direct Dark Matter Detection with Velocity Distribution in the Eddington
  approach","Exotic dark matter together with the vacuum energy (associated with the
cosmological constant) seem to dominate the Universe. Thus its direct detection
is central to particle physics and cosmology. Supersymmetry provides a natural
dark matter candidate, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). One
essential ingredient in obtaining the direct detection rates is the density and
the velocity distribution of the LSP in our vicinity. In the present paper we
study simultaneously density profiles and velocity distributions in the context
of the Eddington approach. In such an approach, unlike the commonly assumed
Maxwell-Boltzmann (M-B) distribution, the upper bound of the velocity arises
naturally from the potential.",2006-03-26T07:29:15Z
UBVJHK synthetic photometry of Galactic O stars,"The development of powerful infrared observational technics enables the study
of very extincted objects and young embedded star forming regions. This is
especially interesting in the context of massive stars which form and spend a
non negligible fraction of their life still enshrouded in their parental
molecular cloud. Spectrophotometric calibrations are thus necessary to
constrain the physical properties of heavily extincted objects. Here, we derive
UBVJHK magnitudes and bolometric corrections from a grid of atmosphere models
for O stars. Bessel passbands are used. Bolometric corrections (BC) are derived
as a function of Teff and are subsequently used to derive BC - spectral type
(ST) and Absolute Magnitudes - ST relations. Infrared magnitudes and, for the
first time, bolometric corrections are given for the full range of spectral
types and luminosity classes. Infrared colors are essentially constant.
Intrinsic H-K colors are 0.05 mag bluer than previously proposed. Optical
calibrations are also provided and are similar to previous work, except for
(B-V)0 which is found to be at minimum -0.28 for standard O stars, slightly
larger (0.04 mag) than commonly accepted.",2006-06-23T14:15:45Z
Seeing the sky through Hubble's eye: The COSMOS SkyWalker,"Large, high-resolution space-based imaging surveys produce a volume of data
that is difficult to present to the public in a comprehensible way. While
megapixel-sized images can still be printed out or downloaded via the World
Wide Web, this is no longer feasible for images with 10^9 pixels (e.g., the
Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys [ACS] images of the Galaxy
Evolution from Morphology and SEDs [GEMS] project) or even 10^10 pixels (for
the ACS Cosmic Evolution Survey [COSMOS]). We present a Web-based utility
called the COSMOS SkyWalker that allows viewing of the huge ACS image data set,
even through slow Internet connections. Using standard HTML and JavaScript, the
application successively loads only those portions of the image at a time that
are currently being viewed on the screen. The user can move within the image by
using the mouse or interacting with an overview image. Using an astrometrically
registered image for the COSMOS SkyWalker allows the display of calibrated
world coordinates for use in science. The SkyWalker ""technique"" can be applied
to other data sets. This requires some customization, notably the slicing up of
a data set into small (e.g., 256^2 pixel) subimages. An advantage of the
SkyWalker is the use of standard Web browser components; thus, it requires no
installation of any software and can therefore be viewed by anyone across many
operating systems.",2006-07-23T22:16:16Z
"Strange magnification pattern in the large separation lens SDSS
  J1004+4112 from optical to X-rays","We present simultaneous XMM-Newton UV and X-ray observations of the quadruply
lensed quasar SDSS J1004+4112 (RBS 825). Simultaneously with the XMM-Newton
observations we also performed integral field spectroscopy on the two closest
lens images A and B using the Calar Alto PMAS spectrograph. In X-rays the
widely spaced components C and D are clearly resolved, while the closer pair of
images A and B is marginally resolved in the XMM-EPIC images. The integrated
X-ray flux of the system has decreased by a factor of 6 since it was observed
in the ROSAT All Sky Survey in 1990, while the X-ray spectrum became much
harder with the power law index evolving from Gamma=-2.3 to -1.86. By
deblending the X-ray images of the lensed QSO we find that the X-ray flux
ratios between the lens images A and B are significantly different from the
simultaneously obtained UV ratios and previously measured optical flux ratios.
Our optical spectrum of lens image A shows an enhancement in the blue emission
line wings, which has been observed in previous epochs as a transient feature.
We propose a scenario where intrinsic UV and X-ray variability gives rise to
line variations which are selectively magnified in image A by microlensing. The
extended emission of the lensing cluster of galaxies is clearly detected in the
EPIC images, we measure a 0.5-2.0 keV luminosity of 1.4 E44 erg/s. Based on the
cluster X-ray properties, we estimate a mass of 2-6 E14 solar masses.",2006-04-18T13:18:02Z
"Accelerating universe in scalar tensor models - confrontation of
  theoretical predictions with observations","We consider scalar tensor theories of gravity assuming that the scalar field
is non minimally coupled with gravity. We use this theory to study evolution of
a flat homogeneous and isotropic universe. In this case the dynamical equations
can be derived form a point like Lagrangian. We study the general properties of
dynamics of this system and show that for a wide range of initial conditions
such models lead in a natural way to an accelerated phase of expansion of the
universe. Assuming that the point like Lagrangian admits a Noether symmetry we
are able to explicitly solve the dynamical equations. We study one particular
model and show that its predictions are compatible with observational data,
namely the publicly available data on type Ia supernovae, the parameters of
large scale structure determined by the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey
(2dFGRS), the measurements of cosmological distances with the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and the rate of growth of density perturbations}{It
turns out that this model have a very interesting feature of producing in a
natural way an epoch of accelerated expansion. With an appropriate choice of

"Swift observations of the 2006 outburst of the recurrent nova RS
  Ophiuchi: I. Early X-ray emission from the shocked ejecta and red giant wind","RS Ophiuchi began its latest outburst on 2006 February 12. Previous outbursts
have indicated that high velocity ejecta interact with a pre-existing red giant
wind, setting up shock systems analogous to those seen in Supernova Remnants.
However, in the previous outburst in 1985, X-ray observations did not commence
until 55 days after the initial explosion. Here we report on Swift observations
covering the first month of the 2006 outburst with the Burst Alert (BAT) and
X-ray Telescope (XRT) instruments. RS Oph was clearly detected in the BAT 14-25
keV band from t=0 to $t\sim6$ days. XRT observationsfrom 0.3-10 keV, started at
3.17 days after outburst. The rapidly evolving XRT spectra clearly show the
presence of both line and continuum emission which can be fitted by thermal
emission from hot gas whose characteristic temperature, overlying absorbing
column, $[N_H]_W$, and resulting unabsorbed total flux decline monotonically
after the first few days. Derived shock velocities are in good agreement with
those found from observations at other wavelengths. Similarly, $[N_H]_W$ is in
accord with that expected from the red giant wind ahead of the forward shock.
We confirm the basic models of the 1985 outburst and conclude that standard
Phase I remnant evolution terminated by $t\sim10$ days and the remnant then
rapidly evolved to display behaviour characteristic of Phase III. Around t=26
days however, a new, luminous and highly variable soft X-ray source began to
appear whose origin will be explored in a subsequent paper.",2006-04-28T18:40:45Z
On the Rayleigh-Taylor Instability of Radio Bubbles in Galaxy Clusters,"We consider the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in the early evolution of the
rarefied radio bubbles (cavities) observed in many cooling flow clusters of
galaxies. The top of a bubble becomes prone to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability
as the bubble rises through the intra-cluster medium (ICM). We show that while
the jet is powering the inflation, the deceleration of the bubble-ICM interface
is able to reverse the Rayleigh-Taylor instability criterion. In addition, the
inflation introduces a drag effect which increases substantially the
instability growth time. The combined action of these two effects considerably
delays the onset of the instability. Later on, when the magnitude of the
deceleration drops or the jet fades, the Rayleigh-Taylor and the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities set in and eventually disrupt the bubble. We
conclude that the initial deceleration and drag, albeit unable to prevent the
disruption of a bubble, may significantly lengthen its lifetime, removing the
need to invoke stabilising magnetic fields.",2006-05-21T06:56:37Z
"The spectral energy distribution of PKS 2004-447: a compact
  steep-spectrum source and possible radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy","(abridged) The spectral energy distribution (SED) of the compact steep
spectrum (CSS) source and possible radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy
(NLS1), PKS2004-447, is presented. Five out of six well studied RL NLS1 share
this dual classification (optically defined as a NLS1 with radio definition of
a CSS or giga-hertz peaked spectrum (GPS) source). The SED is created from
simultaneous observations at radio (ATCA), optical/NIR (Siding Spring) and
UV/X-ray (XMM-Newton) wavelengths. The X-ray data show evidence of short-term
variability, a possible soft excess, and negligible absorption. Together with
the rest of the SED, the X-ray emission is excessive in comparison to
synchrotron plus synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) models. The SED can be
described with a two component model consisting of extended synchrotron/SSC
emission with Comptonisation in the X-rays, though SSC models with a very high
electron-to-magnetic energy density ratio cannot be excluded either. The peak
emission in the SED appears to be in the near infrared, which can be attributed
to thermal emission from a dusty torus. Analysis of a non-contemporaneous, low
resolution optical spectrum suggests that the narrow-line region (NLR) is much
more reddened than the X-ray emitting region suggesting that the gas-to-dust
ratio in PKS2004-447 may be very different then in our own Galaxy. Long-term
radio monitoring of PKS2004-447 shows a rather constant light curve over nearly
a six month period with the exception of one outburst when the 6.65GHz flux
increased by ~35% over 19 days. In comparison to general samples of GPS
sources, which appear to be X-ray weak, NLS1-CSS/GPS sources possess stronger
X-ray emission relative to radio, and lower intrinsic absorption than GPS
sources of similar X-ray luminosity.",2006-04-22T06:45:55Z
Cosmic Rays: Recent Progress and some Current Questions,"Recent progress suggests we are moving towards a quantitative understanding
of the whole cosmic ray spectrum, and that many bumps due to different
components and processes hide beneath a relatively smooth total flux between
knee and ankle. The knee is much better understood: the KASCADE observations
support a rather sharp rigidity cut-off; while theoretical developments (strong
magnetic field generation) indicate that supernova remnants (SNR) of different
types should indeed accelerate to a very similar rigidity. X-ray and TeV
observations of shell-type SNR produce evidence in favour of acceleration at
their outer boundaries. There is some still-disputed evidence that the
transition to extragalactic cosmic rays has already occurred just above 10**17
eV, unmarked by an ""ankle"", in which case the whole spectrum can be well
described by adding a single power-law source spectrum from many extragalactic
sources (but modified by energy losses) to the SNR pre-knee component, if the
sources photodisintegrate all nuclei. At the highest energy, the experiments
using fluorscence light to calibrate energy do not yet show any conflict with
an expected GZK ""termination"". GRBs seem not to make a significant
contribution.",2006-07-06T13:17:07Z
Local Group(s),"The properties of the galaxies of the Local Group are reviewed, followed by a
brief discussion of nearby groups. The galaxy groups in our vicinity - the M81
group, the Cen A group, and the IC 342/Maffei group - are in many respects
Local Group analogs: Their luminosity functions, galaxy content, fractional
galaxy type distribution, crossing times, masses, and zero-velocity surface
radii are similar to those of the Local Group. Also, the nearby groups usually
consist of two subgroups, some of which approach each other and may ultimately
merge to form a fossil group. These poor groups contrast with the less evolved,
loose and extended galaxy ``clouds'' such as the Scl group and the CVn I cloud.
These are characterized by long crossing times, are dominated by gas-rich,
late-type galaxies, and lack gas-deficient, low luminosity early-type dwarfs.
These clouds may be groups still in formation. The local Hubble flow derived
from the clouds and groups is very cold.",2006-05-22T18:53:15Z
"Deep spectroscopy of 9C J1503+4528: a very young CSS radio source at
  z=0.521","9C J1503+4528 is a very young CSS radio galaxy, with an age of order 10^4
years. This source is therefore an ideal laboratory for the study ofthe
intrinsic host galaxy/IGM properties, interactions between the radio source and
surrounding ISM, links between star formation and AGN activity and the radio
source triggering mechanism. Here we present the results of a spectroscopic
analysis of this source, considering each of these aspects of radio source
physics.
  We find that shock ionization by the young radio source is important in the
central regions of the galaxy on scales similar to that of the radio source
itself, whilst evidence for an AGN ionization cone is observed at greater
distances. Line and continuum features require the presence of a young stellar
population, the best-fit model for which implies an age of 5x10^6 years,
significantly older than the radio source.
  Most interestingly, the relative sizes of radio source and extended emission
line region suggest that both AGN and radio source are triggered at
approximately the same time.
  If both the triggering of the radio source activity and the formation of the
young stellar population had the same underlying cause, this source provides a
sequence for the events surrounding the triggering process. We propose that the
AGN activity in 9C J1503+4528 was causedby a relatively minor interaction, and
that a super-massive black hole powering the radio jets must have been in place
before the AGN was triggered.",2006-05-18T15:44:09Z
Probing Inflation and Dark Energy with Current Cosmological Observations,"It is commonly believed that our Universe has experienced two different
stages of accelerated expansion. The early stage is known as inflation and the
current acceleration is driven by dark energy. Observing inflation and dark
energy dynamics are among the most important aspects of the current
cosmological research. In this paper we make a first detailed probe of possible
degeneracies between dynamical inflation and dark energy in light of current
cosmological observations. We find the inclusion of inflation and dark energy
parameters together make the parameter spaces broader, but interestingly
deviation from scale-invariant primordial spectrum is sightly more favored by
current cosmological observations when one marginalizes over dynamical dark
energy models.",2006-03-15T14:36:52Z
Ultraluminous X-ray Sources: Bubbles and Optical Counterparts,"Optical studies of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULX) in nearby galaxies have
turned out to be instrumental in discriminating between various models
including the much advertised intermediate mass black hole hypothesis and
various beaming scenarios. Here we report on ESO VLT and SUBARU observations of
ULX that have revealed the parent stellar clusters with ages of some 60 million
years in two cases. Thus we are able to derive upper limits of about 8 M_sun
for the mass donors in these systems. The optical counterparts are dominated by
X-ray heated accretion disks, and the discovery of the HeII4686 emission line
now allows to derive dynamical masses in these systems. Apparent radial
velocity variations of 300 km/s have been detected in NGC 1313 X-2 which, if
confirmed by further observations, would exclude the presence of IMBH in these
systems.",2006-03-28T17:29:35Z
GRB 060218/SN 2006aj: A Gamma-Ray Burst and Prompt Supernova at z=0.0335,"We report the imaging and spectroscopic localization of GRB 060218 to a
low-metallicity dwarf starburst galaxy at z = 0.03345 +/- 0.00006. In addition
to making it the second nearest gamma-ray burst known, optical spectroscopy
reveals the earliest detection of weak, supernova-like Si II near 5720
Angstroms (0.1c), starting 1.95 days after the burst trigger. UBVRI photometry
obtained between 1 and 26 days post-burst confirms the early rise of supernova
light, and suggests a short time delay between the gamma-ray burst and the
onset of SN 2006aj if the early appearance of a soft component in the X-ray
spectrum is understood as a ``shock breakout''. Together, these results verify
the long-hypothesized origin of soft gamma-ray bursts in the deaths of massive
stars.",2006-03-24T21:00:06Z
"Near-Infrared and Star-forming properties of Local Luminous Infrared
  Galaxies","We use HST NICMOS continuum and Pa-alpha observations to study the
near-infrared and star-formation properties of a representative sample of 30
local (d ~ 35-75Mpc) luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs, infrared 8-1000um
luminosities of L_IR=11-11.9[Lsun]). The data provide spatial resolutions of
25-50pc and cover the central ~3.3-7.1kpc regions of these galaxies. About half
of the LIRGs show compact (~1-2kpc) Pa-alpha emission with a high surface
brightness in the form of nuclear emission, rings, and mini-spirals. The rest
of the sample show Pa-alpha emission along the disk and the spiral arms
extending over scales of 3-7kpc and larger. About half of the sample contains
HII regions with H-alpha luminosities significantly higher than those observed
in normal galaxies. There is a linear empirical relationship between the mid-IR
24um and hydrogen recombination (extinction-corrected Pa-alpha) luminosity for
these LIRGs, and the HII regions in the central part of M51. This relation
holds over more than four decades in luminosity suggesting that the mid-IR
emission is a good tracer of the star formation rate (SFR). Analogous to the
widely used relation between the SFR and total IR luminosity of Kennicutt
(1998), we derive an empirical calibration of the SFR in terms of the
monochromatic 24um luminosity that can be used for luminous, dusty galaxies.",2006-06-08T09:26:33Z
"UV and FIR selected star-forming galaxies at z=0: differences and
  overlaps","We study two samples of local galaxies, one is UV (GALEX) selected and the
other FIR (IRAS) selected, to address the question whether UV and FIR surveys
see the two sides ('bright' and 'dark') of the star formation of the same
population of galaxies or two different populations of star forming galaxies.
No significant difference between the L$_{tot}$ ($=L_{60}+L_{FUV}$) luminosity
functions of the UV and FIR samples is found. Also, after the correction for
the `Malmquist bias' (bias for flux limited samples), the FIR-to-UV ratio v.s.
L$_{tot}$ relations of the two samples are consistent with each other. In the
range of $9 \la \log(L_{tot}/L_\sun) \la 12$, both can be approximated by a
simple linear relation of $\log (L_{60}/L_{FUV})=\log(L_{tot}/L_\sun)-9.66$.
These are consistent with the hypothesis that the two samples represent the
same population of star forming galaxies, and their well documented differences
in L$_{tot}$ and in FIR-to-UV ratio are due only to the selection effect. A
comparison between the UV luminosity functions shows marginal evidence for a
population of faint UV galaxies missing in the FIR selected sample. The
contribution from these 'FIR-quiet' galaxies to the overall UV population is
insignificant, given that the K-band luminosity functions (i.e. the stellar
mass functions) of the two samples do not show any significant difference.",2006-04-04T12:41:53Z
"Chandra/HETGS Observations of the Capella System: the Primary as a
  Dominating X-ray Source","Using the Chandra/High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (hereafter
HETGS) we have detected Doppler motion of Capella's X-ray emission lines in the
6 -- 25AA wave-band. The observed motion follows the expected orbital motion of
Capella's primary. This finding implies that the primary G8 III star, not the
secondary G1 III star in the Hertzsprung gap, has been the dominant source of
hot 10^{6.8} -- 10^{7}K plasma at least in the last six years. In addition, the
results demonstrate the long-term stability of the HETGS and demonstrate small
uncertainties of 25 and 33 km/s in the velocity determination with the HEG and
MEG, respectively.",2006-05-16T10:39:04Z
"The Spitzer Space Telescope Extra-Galactic First Look Survey: 24 micron
  data reduction, catalog, and source identification","We present the reduction of the 24 micron data obtained during the first
cosmological survey performed by the Spitzer Space Telescope (First Look
Survey, FLS). The survey consists of a shallow observation of 2.5x2 sq deg
centered at 17h18m +59d30m (main survey) and a deeper observation of 1x0.5 sq
deg centered at 17h17m +59d45m(verification survey). Issues with the reduction
of the 24 micron MIPS data are discussed and solutions to attenuate
instrumental effects are proposed and applied to the data. Approximately 17000
sources are extracted with a SNR greater than five. The photometry of the point
sources is evaluated through PSF fitting using an empirical PSF derived from
the data. Aperture corrections and the absolute calibration have been checked
using stars in the field. Astrometric and photometric errors depend on the SNR
of the source varying between 0.35-1 arcsec and 5-15%, respectively, for
sources detected at 20-5 sigma. The flux of the 123 extended sources have been
estimated through aperture photometry. The extended sources cover less than
0.3% of the total area of the survey. Based on simulations, the main and
verification surveys are 50% complete at 0.3 and 0.15 mJy, respectively.
Counterparts have been searched for in optical and radio catalogs. More than
80% of the 24 micron sources have a reliable optical counterpart down to
R=25.5. 16% of the sources have a 20 cm counterpart down to 0.1 mJy and ~ 80%
of the radio-infrared associations have a reliable optical counterpart. A
residual map is obtained by subtracting point sources detected at the 3-sigma
level and interpolating the regions occupied by extended sources. Several
galactic clouds with low and intermediate velocities are identified by
comparison with neutral Hydrogen data from this field.",2006-03-17T21:27:46Z
"A Quasi-Periodic Modulation of the Radio Light Curve of the Blazar PKS
  B0048-097","In this letter we present the results of a wavelet analysis of the radio
light curve of the BL Lac Object PKS B0048-097 from the University of Michigan
Radio Astronomy Observatory monitoring program at 8GHz during twenty-five
years, from 1979 to 2004. The results show a remarkable periodicity of 450-470
days in the early 1980s that changed to a ~585 day periodicity in the late
1980s to early 1990s. A less pronounced ~400 day periodicity is found after
\~1995. Very-long-baseline interferometry imaging at 15GHz shows dramatic
structural changes in the usually unresolved source between two epochs, 1995.57
and 2002.38. The pronounced northward directed jet seen in the 2002 image
differs by more than 90 degrees in direction from the source structure found in
earlier epochs. These findings make PKS B0048-097 a primary target for
multi-wavelength observations and intensive radio monitoring to decipher the
blazar-variability phenomenon.",2006-05-23T12:39:34Z
On the one loop corrections to inflation and the CMB anisotropies,"We investigate the one loop effective potential of inflation in a standard
model of chaotic inflation. The leading one loop corrections to the effective
inflaton potential are evaluated in the quasi de Sitter background, and we
estimate the one loop correction to the two-point function of the inflaton
perturbations in the Hartree approximation. In this approximation, the one loop
corrections depends on the total number of e-foldings of inflation and the
maximal effect is estimated to be a correction to the power spectrum of a few
percent. However, such a correction may be difficult to disentangle from the
background in the simplest scenario.",2006-04-24T04:58:56Z
"Nonlinear Structure Formation and ""Apparent"" Acceleration: an
  Investigation","We present an analytically solvable nonlinear model of structure formation in
a Universe with only dust. The model is an LTB solution (of General Relativity)
and structures are shells of different density. We show that the luminosity
distance-redshift relation has significant corrections at low redshift when the
density contrast becomes nonlinear. A minimal effect is a correction in
apparent magnitudes of order 0.15. We discuss different possibilities that
could further enhance this effect and mimick Dark Energy.",2006-06-28T23:13:35Z
"High Contrast L' Band Adaptive Optics Imaging to Detect Extrasolar
  Planets","We are carrying out a survey to search for giant extrasolar planets around
nearby, moderate-age stars in the mid-infrared L' and M bands (3.8 and 4.8
microns, respectively), using the Clio camera with the adaptive optics system
on the MMT telescope. To date we have observed 7 stars, of a total 50 planned,
including GJ 450 (distance about 8.55pc, age about 1 billion years, no real
companions detected), which we use as our example here. We report the methods
we use to obtain extremely high contrast imaging in L', and the performance we
have obtained. We find that the rotation of a celestial object over time with
respect to a telescope tracking it with an altazimuth mount can be a powerful
tool for subtracting telescope-related stellar halo artifacts and detecting
planets near bright stars. We have carried out a thorough Monte Carlo
simulation demonstrating our ability to detect planets as small as 6 Jupiter
masses around GJ 450. The division of a science data set into two independent
parts, with companions required to be detected on both in order to be
recognized as real, played a crucial role in detecting companions in this
simulation. We mention also our discovery of a previously unknown faint stellar
companion to another of our survey targets, HD 133002. Followup is needed to
confirm this as a physical companion, and to determine its physical properties.",2006-06-19T18:57:38Z
A Genuine Intermediate-Age Globular Cluster in M33,"We present deep integrated-light spectroscopy of nine M33 globular clusters
taken with the Hectospec instrument at the MMT Observatory. Based on our
spectroscopy and previous deep color-magnitude diagrams obtained with
HST/WFPC2, we present evidence for the presence of a genuine intermediate-age
globular cluster in M33. The analysis of Lick line indices indicates that all
globular clusters are metal-poor ([Z/H] <~ -1.0) and that cluster M33-C38 is
about 5-8 Gyr younger than the rest of the sample M33 star clusters. We find no
evidence for a population of blue horizontal branch stars in the CMD of
M33-C38, which rules out the possibility of an artificially young spectroscopic
age due to the presence of hot stars. We infer a total mass of 5-9 x 10^4 M_sol
for M33-C38, which implies that M33-C38 has survived ~2-3 times longer than
some dynamical evolution model predictions for star clusters in M33, although
it is not yet clear to which dynamical component of M33 - thin disk, thick
disk, halo - the cluster is associated.",2006-06-19T17:49:23Z
Variability of V838 Mon Before Its Outburst,"Archival observations of the progenitor of V838 Mon were re-calibrated as
well as multiple images from the 2MASS and the DENIS near infrared surveys.
Both - the better calibrated values as well as the variability found in the
photographic material has strong effects for the fitting of the spectral energy
distribution of the progenitor.",2006-05-09T11:52:36Z
HI content in galaxies in loose groups,"Gas deficiency in cluster spirals is well known and ram-pressure stripping is
considered the main gas removal mechanism. In some compact groups too gas
deficiency is reported. However, gas deficiency in loose groups is not yet well
established. Lower dispersion of the member velocities and the lower density of
the intra-group medium in small loose groups favour tidal stripping as the main
gas removal process in them. Recent releases of data from HI Parkes all sky
survey (HIPASS) and catalogues of nearby loose groups with associated diffuse
X-ray emission have allowed us to test this notion. In this paper, we address
the following questions: (a) do galaxies in groups with diffuse X-ray emission
statistically have lower gas content compared to the ones in groups without
diffuse X-ray emission? (b) does HI deficiency vary with the X-ray luminosity
of the loose group in a systematic way? We find that (a) galaxies in groups
with diffuse X-ray emission, on average, are HI deficient, and have lost more
gas compared to those in groups without X-ray emission; the later are found not
to have significant HI deficiency; (b) no systematic dependence of the HI
deficiency with X-ray luminosity is found. Ram pressure assisted tidal
stripping and evaporation by thermal conduction are the two possible mechanisms
to account for this excess gas loss.",2006-04-03T08:59:17Z
"Recipes for stellar jets: results of combined optical/infrared
  diagnostics","We examine the conditions of the plasma along a sample of 'classical'
Herbig-Haro jets located in the Orion and Vela star forming regions, through
combined optical-infrared spectral diagnostics. Our sample includes HH 111, HH
34, HH 83, HH 73, HH 24 C/E, HH 24 J, observed at moderate spatial/spectral
resolution. The obtained spectra cover a wide wavelength range from 0.6-2.5 um,
including many transitions from regions of different excitation conditions.
This allows us to probe the density and temperature stratification which
characterises the cooling zones behind the shock fronts along the jet. The
derived physical parameters (such as the extinction, the electron density and
temperature, the ionisation fraction, and the total density) are used to
estimate the depletion onto dust grains of Calcium and Iron with respect to
solar abundances. This turns out to be between 70% and 0% for Ca and ~90% for
Fe, suggesting that the weak shocks present in the beams are not capable of
completely destroying the dust grains. We then derive the mass flux rates
(Mdot_jet is on average 5 10^-8 M_solar yr^-1) and the associated linear
momentum fluxes. The latter are higher than, or of the same order as, those
measured in the coaxial molecular flows, suggesting that the flows are jet
driven. Finally, we discuss differences between jets in our sample.",2006-06-12T20:21:07Z
"The Galactic WN stars: Spectral analyses with line-blanketed model
  atmospheres versus stellar evolution models with and without rotation","CONTEXT: Very massive stars pass through the Wolf-Rayet (WR) stage before
they finally explode. Details of their evolution have not yet been safely
established, and their physics are not well understood. Their spectral analysis
requires adequate model atmospheres, which have been developed step by step
during the past decades and account in their recent version for line blanketing
by the millions of lines from iron and iron-group elements. However, only very
few WN stars have been re-analyzed by means of line-blanketed models yet.
  AIMS: The quantitative spectral analysis of a large sample of Galactic WN
stars with the most advanced generation of model atmospheres should provide an
empirical basis for various studies about the origin, evolution, and physics of
the Wolf-Rayet stars and their powerful winds.
  METHODS: We analyze a large sample of Galactic WN stars by means of the
Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmospheres, which account for iron line
blanketing and clumping. The results are compared with a synthetic population,
generated from the Geneva tracks for massive star evolution. RESULTS: We obtain
a homogeneous set of stellar and atmospheric parameters for the Galactic WN
stars, partly revising earlier results.
  CONCLUSIONS: Comparing the results of our spectral analyses of the Galactic
WN stars with the predictions of the Geneva evolutionary calculations, we
conclude that there is rough qualitative agreement. However, the quantitative
discrepancies are still severe, and there is no preference for the tracks that
account for the effects of rotation. It seems that the evolution of massive
stars is still not satisfactorily understood.",2006-08-03T14:52:31Z
The influence of gas on the structure of merger remnants,"We present a large set of merger simulations of early-type disc galaxies with
mass ratios of 1:1 and 3:1 and 10% of the total disc mass in gas. In contrast
to the collisionless case equal-mass mergers with gas do not result in very
boxy remnants which is caused by the suppression of box orbits and the change
of the projected shape of minor-axis tube orbits in the more axisymmetric
remnants. The isophotal shape of 3:1 remnants and the global kinematic
properties of 1:1 and 3:1 remnants are only weakly affected by the presence of
gas. 1:1 remnants are slowly rotating whereas 3:1 remnants are fast rotating
and discy. The shape of the stellar LOSVD is strongly influenced by gas. The
LOSVDs of collisionless remnants have broad leading wings while their gaseous
counterparts show steep leading wings, more consistent with observations of
elliptical galaxies. We show that this change is also caused by the suppressed
populating of box orbits and it is amplified by the formation of extended gas
discs in the merger remnants. If elliptical galaxies have formed from mergers
our results indicate that massive, slowly rotating boxy elliptical galaxies can
not have formed from dissipative mergers of discs. Pure stellar (dry) mergers
are the more likely candidates. On the other hand lower mass, fast rotating and
discy ellipticals can have formed from dissipative (wet) mergers of early-type
discs. So far, only unequal-mass disc mergers with gas can successfully explain
their observed substructure. This is consistent with the revised morphological
classification scheme of increasing importance of gas dissipation when moving
from boxy ellipticals to discy ellipticals and then to spiral galaxies,
proposed by Kormendy & Bender (abbreviated).",2006-05-05T10:49:20Z
"Comment on ``General Relativity Resolves Galactic Rotation Without
  Exotic Dark Matter'' by F.I. Cooperstock & S. Tieu","The general relativistic model of Cooperstock & Tieu, which attempts to fit
rotation curves of spiral galaxies without invoking dark matter, is tested
empirically using observations of the Milky Way. In particular, predictions for
the mass density in the solar neighbourhood and the vertical density
distribution at the position of the Sun are compared with observations. It is
shown that the model of Cooperstock & Tieu, which was so constructed that it
gives an excellent fit of the observed rotation curve, singularly fails to
reproduce the observed local mass density and the vertical density profile of
the Milky Way.",2006-04-03T09:15:59Z
New Analytical Formula for Supercritical Accretion Flows,"We examine a new family of global analytic solutions for optically thick
accretion disks, which includes the supercritical accretion regime. We found
that the ratio of the advection cooling rate, $Q_{\rm adv}$, to the viscous
heating rate, $Q_{\rm vis}$, i.e., $f=Q_{\rm adv}/Q_{\rm vis}$, can be
represented by an analytical form dependent on the radius and the mass
accretion rate. The new analytic solutions can be characterized by the
photon-trapping radius, $\rtrap$, inside which the accretion time is less than
the photon diffusion time in the vertical direction; the nature of the
solutions changes significantly as this radius is crossed. Inside the trapping
radius,
  $f$ approaches $f \propto r^0$, which corresponds to the advection-dominated
limit ($f \sim 1$), whereas outside the trapping radius, the radial dependence
of $f$ changes to $f \propto r^{-2}$, which corresponds to the
radiative-cooling-dominated limit. The analytical formula for $f$ derived here
smoothly connects these two regimes. The set of new analytic solutions
reproduces well the global disk structure obtained by numerical integration
over a wide range of mass accretion rates, including the supercritical
accretion regime. In particular, the effective temperature profiles for our new
solutions are in good agreement with those obtained from numerical solutions.
Therefore, the new solutions will provide a useful tool not only for evaluating
the observational properties of accretion flows, but also for investigating the
mass evolution of black holes in the presence of supercritical accretion flows.",2006-05-10T03:16:40Z
The atypical emission-line star Hen3-209,"We analyse observations, spanning 15 years, dedicated to the extreme
emission-line object Hen3-209. Our photometric data indicate that the
luminosity of the star undergoes marked variations with a peak-to-peak
amplitude of 0.65mag. These variations are recurrent, with a period of
16.093+-0.005d. The spectrum of Hen3-209 is peculiar with many different lines
(HI, HeI, FeII,...) showing P Cygni profiles. The line profiles are apparently
changing in harmony with the photometry. The spectrum also contains [OIII]
lines that display a saddle profile topped by three peaks, with a maximum
separation of about 600km/s. Hen3-209 is most likely an evolved luminous object
suffering from mass ejection events and maybe belonging to a binary system.",2006-06-26T15:32:31Z
"The surprising magnetic topology of tauSco: fossil remnant or dynamo
  output?","We report the discovery of a medium-strength (~0.5kG) magnetic field on the
young, massive star tauSco (B0.2V), which becomes the third-hottest magnetic
star known. Circularly polarized Zeeman signatures are clearly detected in
observations collected mostly with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter, recently
installed on the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope; temporal variability is
also clearly established in the polarimetry, and can be unambiguously
attributed to rotational modulation with a period close to 41d. Archival UV
spectra confirm that this modulation repeats over timescales of decades.
  By reconstructing the large-scale structure of its magnetic topology, we find
that the magnetic structure is unusually complex for a hot star. The surface
topology is dominated by a potential field, although a moderate toroidal
component is probably present. We fail to detect intrinsic temporal variability
of the magnetic structure over the 1.5-yr period of our spectropolarimetric
observations (in agreement with the stable temporal variations of the UV
spectra), and infer that any differential surface rotation must be very small.
  The topology of the extended magnetic field that we derive from the
photospheric magnetic maps is also more complex than a global dipole, and
features in particular a significantly warped torus of closed magnetic loops
encircling the star (tilted at about 90deg to the rotation axis), with
additional, smaller, networks of closed field lines. This topology appears to
be consistent with the exceptional Xray properties of tauSco and also provides
a natural explanation of the variability observed in wind-formed UV lines. We
conclude that its magnetic field is most probably a fossil remnant from the
star-formation stage.",2006-06-07T15:47:55Z
How to calculate the CMB spectrum,"We present a self-contained description of everything needed to write a
program that calculates the CMB power spectrum for the standard model of
cosmology (LCDM). This includes the equations used, assumptions and
approximations imposed on their solutions, and most importantly the algorithms
and programming tricks needed to make the code actually work. The resulting
program is compared to CMBFAST and typically agrees to within 0.1% - 0.4%. It
includes both helium, reionization, neutrinos and the polarization power
spectrum. The methods presented here could serve as a starting point for people
wanting to write their own CMB program from scratch, for instance to look at
more exotic cosmological models where CMBFAST or the other standard programs
can't be used directly.",2006-06-28T10:55:02Z
"Arc sensitivity to cluster ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures","We investigate how ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures separately
affect the ability of galaxy clusters to produce strong lensing events, i.e.
gravitational arcs, and how they influence the arc morphologies and fluxes.
This is important for those studies aiming, for example, at constraining
cosmological parameters from statistical lensing, or at determining the inner
structure of galaxy clusters through gravitational arcs. We do so by creating
two-dimensional gradually smoothed, differently elliptical and asymmetric
versions of some numerical models. On average, we find that the contributions
of ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures amount to ~40%, ~10% and ~30% of
the total strong lensing cross section, respectively. However, our analysis
shows that substructures play a more important role in less elliptical and
asymmetric clusters, even if located at large distances from the cluster
centers (~1Mpc/h). Conversely, their effect is less important in highly
asymmetric lenses. The morphology, position and flux of individual arcs are
strongly affected by the presence of substructures in the clusters. Removing
substructures on spatial scales <~50kpc/h, roughly corresponding to mass scales
<~5 10^{10}M_\odot/h, alters the image multiplicity of ~35% of the sources used
in the simulations and causes position shifts larger than 5'' for ~40% of the
arcs longer than 5''. We conclude that any model for cluster lens cannot
neglect the effects of ellipticity, asymmetries and substructures. On the other
hand, the high sensitivity of gravitational arcs to deviations from regular,
smooth and symmetric mass distributions suggests that strong gravitational
lensing is potentially a powerfull tool to measure the level of substructures
and asymmetries in clusters.",2006-05-31T21:59:49Z
The velocity dispersion and mass profile of the Milky Way,"We re-analyse the velocity-dispersion profile sigma(r) at radii r>10 kpc in
the Galactic stellar halo, recently derived by Battaglia et al. (2005), who
concluded that, for constant velocity anisotropy of the tracers, these data
rule out a flat circular-speed curve for the Milky Way. However, we demonstrate
that if one makes the natural assumption that the tracer density is truncated
at r_t >~ 160 kpc and falls off significantly more steeply than r^-3.5 at r >~
80 kpc, then these data are consistent with a flat circular-speed curve and a
constant velocity anisotropy comparable to that observed for halo stars in the
Solar neighbourhood. We also consider a more detailed mass model with an
exponential stellar disc and an extended non-isothermal dark-matter halo. In
this two-component model, the Milky Way's virial radius and mass are r_vir =
200 kpc and M_vir = 1.5 x 10^12 M_sun. Still assuming the tracers' velocity
anisotropy to be constant (at beta=0.5) we again find good agreement with the
observed sigma(r), so long as the tracer density is truncated near the virial
radius. These data by themselves do not allow to differentiate between
different dark-halo or total-mass models for the Milky Way, nor between
different velocity-anisotropy profiles for the tracers.",2006-03-30T16:42:34Z
"Unconstrained Astrometric Orbits for Hipparcos Stars with Stochastic
  Solutions","A considerable number of astrometric binaries whose positions on the sky do
not obey the standard model of mean position, parallax and linear proper
motion, were observed by the Hipparcos satellite. Some of them remain
non-discovered, and their observational data have not been properly processed
with the more adequate astrometric model that includes nonlinear orbital
motion. We develop an automated algorithm based on ""genetic optimization"", to
solve the orbital fitting problem with no prior information about the orbital
elements is available (from, e.g., spectroscopic data or radial velocity
monitoring). We test this method on Hipparcos stars with known orbital
solutions in the catalog, and further apply it to stars with stochastic
solutions, which may be unresolved binaries. At a confidence level of 99%,
orbital fits are obtained for 65 stars, most of which have not been known as
binary. A few of the new probable binaries with A-type primaries with periods
444-2015 d are chemically peculiar stars, including Ap and \lambda Boo type.
The anomalous spectra of these stars are explained as admixture of the light
from the unresolved, sufficiently bright and massive companions. We estimate
the apparent orbits of four stars which have been identified as members of the
300 Myr-old UMa kinematic group. Another four new nearby binaries may include
low-mass M-type or brown dwarf companions. Similar astrometric models and
algorithms can be used for binary stars and planet hosts observed by SIM
PlanetQuest and Gaia.",2006-06-13T04:47:14Z
"X-ray Detection of the Proto Supermassive Binary Black Hole at the
  Centre of Abell 400","We report the first X-ray detection of a proto-supermassive binary black hole
at the centre of Abell 400. Using the Chandra ACIS, we are able to clearly
resolve the two active galactic nuclei in 3C 75, the well known double radio
source at the centre of Abell 400. Through analysis of the new Chandra
observation of Abell 400 along with 4.5 GHz and 330 MHz VLA radio data, we will
show new evidence that the Active Galactic Nuclei in 3C 75 are a bound system.
Methods. Using the high quality X-ray data, we map the temperature, pressure,
density, and entropy of the inner regions as well as the cluster profile
properties out to ~18'. We compare features in the X-ray and radio images to
determine the interaction between the intra-cluster medium and extended radio
emission. The Chandra image shows an elongation of the cluster gas along the
northeast-southwest axis; aligned with the initial bending of 3C 75's jets.
Additionally, the temperature profile shows no cooling core, consistent with a
merging system. There is an apparent shock to the south of the core consistent
with a Mach number of M~1.4 or speed of v~1200 km s^-1. Both Active Galactic
Nuclei, at least in projection, are located in the low entropy, high density
core just north of the shock region. We find that the projected path of the
jets does not follow the intra-cluster medium surface brightness gradient as
expected if their path were due to buoyancy. We also find that both central AGN
are extended and include a thermal component. Based on this analysis, we
conclude that the Active Galactic Nuclei in 3C 75 are a bound system from a
previous merger. They are contained in a low entropy core moving through the
intra-cluster medium at 1200 km s^-1. The bending of the jets is due to the
local intra-cluster medium wind.",2006-03-10T16:51:05Z

signal-to-noise spectra of a sample of planetary nebulae. Analysis of lines
from ions of Kr and Xe reveals enhancements in most of the PNe, in agreement
with the theories of s-process in AGB star. Surprisingly, we did not detect

"On the Distance to the Bright Nonthermal Radio Sources in the Direction
  of an Extraordinarily Massive Cluster of Red Giants","An extraordinarily massive cluster of red supergiants has been recently
reported in the direction of the galactic coordinates $l = 25\rlap.^\circ3$; $b
= -0\rlap.^\circ2$. This cluster is associated with an X-ray source, a very
high-energy $\gamma$-ray source, and three bright non-thermal radio sources.
The \sl a priori \rm probability of these associations being only line-of-sight
coincidences is very small. However, we have analyzed VLA archive data taken
toward these three radio sources and find from their HI absorption spectra that
they are extragalactic and thus not directly associated with the galactic
cluster.",2006-04-07T14:40:53Z
"The black hole fundamental plane from a uniform sample of radio and
  X-ray emitting broad line AGNs","We derived the black hole fundamental plane relationship among the 1.4GHz
radio luminosity (L_r), 0.1-2.4keV X-ray luminosity (L_X), and black hole mass
(M) from a uniform broad line SDSS AGN sample including both radio loud and
radio quiet X-ray emitting sources. We found in our sample that the fundamental
plane relation has a very weak dependence on the black hole mass, and a tight
correlation also exists between the Eddington luminosity scaled X-ray and radio
luminosities for the radio quiet subsample. Additionally, we noticed that the
radio quiet and radio loud AGNs have different power-law slopes in the
radio--X-ray non-linear relationship. The radio loud sample displays a slope of
1.39, which seems consistent with the jet dominated X-ray model. However, it
may also be partly due to the relativistic beaming effect. For radio quiet
sample the slope of the radio--X-ray relationship is about 0.85, which is
possibly consistent with the theoretical prediction from the accretion flow
dominated X-ray model. We briefly discuss the reason why our derived
relationship is different from some previous works and expect the future
spectral studies in radio and X-ray bands on individual sources in our sample
to confirm our result.",2006-03-19T13:20:31Z
A kinematical approach to dark energy studies,"We present and employ a new kinematical approach to cosmological `dark
energy' studies. We construct models in terms of the dimensionless second and
third derivatives of the scale factor a(t) with respect to cosmic time t,
namely the present-day value of the deceleration parameter q_0 and the cosmic
jerk parameter, j(t). An elegant feature of this parameterization is that all
LCDM models have j(t)=1 (constant), which facilitates simple tests for
departures from the LCDM paradigm. Applying our model to the three best
available sets of redshift-independent distance measurements, from type Ia
supernovae and X-ray cluster gas mass fraction measurements, we obtain clear
statistical evidence for a late time transition from a decelerating to an
accelerating phase. For a flat model with constant jerk, j(t)=j, we measure
q_0=-0.81+-0.14 and j=2.16+0.81-0.75, results that are consistent with LCDM at
about the 1sigma confidence level. A standard `dynamical' analysis of the same
data, employing the Friedmann equations and modeling the dark energy as a fluid
with an equation of state parameter, w (constant), gives
Omega_m=0.306+0.042-0.040 and w=-1.15+0.14-0.18, also consistent with LCDM at
about the 1sigma level. In comparison to dynamical analyses, the kinematical
approach uses a different model set and employs a minimum of prior information,
being independent of any particular gravity theory. The results obtained with
this new approach therefore provide important additional information and we
argue that both kinematical and dynamical techniques should be employed in
future dark energy studies, where possible. Our results provide further
interesting support for the concordance LCDM paradigm.",2006-05-29T08:31:38Z
Spectroscopy of Young Planetary Mass Candidates with Disks,"It is now well established that many young brown dwarfs exhibit
characteristics similar to classical T Tauri stars, including infrared excess
from disks and emission lines related to accretion. Whether the same holds true
for even lower mass objects, namely those near and below the Deuterium-burning
limit, is an important question. Here we present optical spectra of six
isolated planetary mass candidates in Chamaeleon II, Lupus I and Ophiuchus
star-forming regions, recently identified by Allers and collaborators to harbor
substantial mid-infrared excesses. Our spectra, from ESO's Very Large Telescope
and New Technology Telescope, show that four of the targets have spectral types
in the ~M9-L1 range, and three of those also exhibit H_alpha. Their
luminosities are consistent with masses of ~5-15 M_{Jupiter} according to
models of Chabrier, Baraffe and co-workers, thus placing these four objects
among the lowest mass brown dwarfs known to be surrounded by circum-sub-stellar
disks. Our findings bolster the idea that free-floating planetary mass objects
could have infancies remarkably similar to those of Sun-like stars and suggest
the intriguing possibility of planet formation around primaries whose masses
are comparable to those of extra-solar giant planets. Another target appears to
be a brown dwarf (~M8) with prominent H_alpha emission, possibly arising from
accretion. The sixth candidate is likely a background source, underlining the
need for spectroscopic confirmation.",2006-07-07T20:48:09Z
"Fe-bump instability: the excitation of pulsations in subdwarf B and
  other low-mass stars","We consider the excitation of radial and non-radial oscillations in low-mass
B stars by the iron-bump opacity mechanism. The results are significant for the
interpretation of pulsations in subdwarf B stars, helium-rich subdwarfs and
extreme helium stars, including the EC14026 and PG1716 variables. We
demonstrate that, for radial oscillations, the driving mechanism becomes
effective by increasing the contrast between the iron-bump opacity and the
opacity from other sources. The location of the iron-bump instability boundary
depends on the mean molecular weight in the envelope and also on the radial
order of the oscillation. A bluer instability boundary is provided by
increasing the iron abundance alone, explaining the observed EC14026 variables,
and by higher radial order oscillations. We show that the coolest EC14026
variables may vary in the fundamental radial mode, but the hottest variables
must be of higher radial order. In considering non-radial oscillations, we
demonstrate that g-modes of high radial order and low spherical degree (l<4)
may be excited in some blue horizontal branch stars with near-normal
composition (Z=0.02). Additional iron enhancement extends the g-mode
instability zone to higher effective temperatures and also creates a p-mode
instability zone. With sufficient iron, the p-mode and g-mode instability zones
overlap, allowing a small region where the EC14026 and PG1716-type variability
can be excited simultaneously. However its location is roughly 5000 K too low
compared with the observed boundary between EC14026 and PG1716 variables.",2006-06-23T16:24:21Z
A Universal Magnetic Helicity Integral,"A magnetic helicity integral is proposed which can be applied to domains
which are not magnetically closed, i.e. have a non-vanishing normal component
of the magnetic field on the boundary. In contrast to the relative helicity
integral, which was previously suggested for magnetically open domains, it does
not rely on a reference field and thus avoids all problems related to the
choice of a particular reference field. Instead it uses a gauge condition on
the vector potential, which corresponds to a particular topologically unique
closure of the magnetic field in the external space. The integral has
additional elegant properties and is easy to compute numerically in practice.
For magnetically closed domains it reduces to the classical helicity integral.",2006-06-28T20:03:35Z
Inflation and WMAP three year data: Features have a Future!,"The new three year WMAP data seem to confirm the presence of non-standard
large scale features in the Cosmic Microwave Anisotropies power spectrum. While
these features may hint at uncorrected experimental systematics, it is also
possible to generate, in a cosmological way, oscillations on large angular
scales by introducing a sharp step in the inflaton potential. Using current
cosmological data, we derive constraints on the position, magnitude and
gradient of a possible step. We show that a step in the inflaton potential,
while strongly constrained by current data, is still allowed and may provide an
interesting explanation to the currently measured deviations from the standard
featureless spectrum. Moreover, we show that inflationary oscillations in the
primordial power spectrum can significantly bias parameter estimates from
standard ruler methods involving measurements of baryon oscillations.",2006-06-19T15:38:30Z
Stellar Collapse Dynamics With Neutrino Flavor Changing Neutral Currents,"We perform one-zone simulations of the infall epoch of a pre-supernova
stellar core in the presence of neutrino flavor changing scattering
interactions. Our calculations give a self-consistent assessment of the
relationship between flavor changing rates and the reduction in electron
fraction and re-distribution of initial electron lepton number among the
neutrino flavors. We discuss and include in our calculations sub-nuclear
density medium corrections for flavor changing scattering coherence factors. We
find that flavor changing couplings epsilon > 3x10^(-4) in either the electron
neutrino - muon neutrino or electron neutrino - tau neutrino channels result in
a dynamically significant reduction in core electron fraction relatively soon
after neutrino trapping and well before the core reaches nuclear matter
density.",2006-06-24T01:43:54Z
"Measurement of Orbital Decay in the Double Neutron Star Binary PSR
  B2127+11C","We report the direct measurement of orbital period decay in the double
neutron star pulsar system PSR B2127+11C in the globular cluster M15 at the
rate of $(-3.95 \pm 0.13) \times 10^{-12}$, consistent with the prediction of
general relativity at the $\sim 3 %$ level. We find the pulsar mass to be $m_p
= (1.358 \pm 0.010) M_\odot$ and the companion mass $m_c = (1.354 \pm 0.010)
M_\odot$. We also report long-term pulse timing results for the pulsars PSR

motion.",2006-05-15T20:56:24Z
The role of project science in the Chandra X-ray Observatory,"The Chandra X-ray Observatory, one of NASA's Great Observatories, has an
outstanding record of scientific and technical success. This success results
from the efforts of a team comprising NASA, its contractors, the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory, the instrument groups, and other elements of the
scientific community -- including the thousands of scientists who utilize this
powerful facility for astrophysical research. We discuss the role of NASA
Project Science in the formulation, development, calibration, and operation of
the Chandra X-ray Observatory. In addition to serving as an interface between
the scientific community and the Project, Project Science performed what we
term ""science systems engineering"". This activity encompasses translation of
science requirements into technical requirements and assessment of the
scientific impact of programmatic and technical trades. We briefly describe
several examples of science systems engineering conducted by Chandra Project
Science.",2006-06-14T19:36:47Z
Restoring Color-magnitude Diagrams with the Richardson-Lucy Algorithm,"We present an application of the Richardson-Lucy algorithm to the analysis of
color-magnitude diagrams by converting the CMD into an image and using a
restoring point spread function function ({\it psf}) derived from the known,
often complex, sources of error. We show numerical experiments that demonstrate
good recovery of the original image and establish convergence rates for ideal
cases with single gaussian uncertainties and poisson noise using a $\chi^2$
statistic. About 30-50 iterations suffice. As an application, we show the
results for a particular case, the Hipparcos sample of the solar neighborhood
where the uncertainties are mainly due to parallax which we model with a
composite weighted gaussian using the observed error distributions. The
resulting psf has a slightly narrower core and broader wings than a single
gaussian. The reddening and photometric errors are considerably reduced by
restricting the sample to within 80 pc and to M_V \leq 3.5. We find that the
recovered image, which has a narrower, better defined main sequence and a more
clearly defined red giant clump, can be used as input to stellar evolution
modeling of the star formation rate in the solar vicinity and, with more
contributing uncertainties taken into account, for general Galactic and
extragalactic structure and population studies.",2006-03-12T14:55:45Z
"Supernovae, Lensed CMB and Dark Energy","Supernova distance and primary CMB anisotropy measurements provide powerful
probes of the dark energy evolution in a flat universe but degrade
substantially once curvature is marginalized. We show that lensed CMB
polarization power spectrum measurements, accessible to next generation ground
based surveys such as SPTpol or QUIET, can remove the curvature degeneracy at a
level sufficient for the SNAP and Planck surveys and allow a measurement of
sigma(w_p)=0.03, sigma(w_a)=0.3 jointly with sigma(Omega_K)=0.0035. This
expectation assumes that the sum of neutrino masses is independently known to
better than 0.1 eV. This assumption is valid if the lightest neutrino is
assumed to have negligible mass in a normal neutrino mass hierarchy and is
potentially testable with upcoming direct laboratory measurements.",2006-07-13T22:34:50Z
Origin of Disc Lopsidedness in the Eridanus Group of Galaxies,"The HI surface density maps for a sample of 18 galaxies in the Eridanus group
are Fourier analysed. This analysis gives the radial variation of the
lopsidedness in the HI spatial distribution. The lopsidedness is quantified by
the Fourier amplitude $A_1$ of the $m=1$ component normalized to the average
value. It is also shown that in the radial region where the stellar disc and HI
overlap, their $A_1$ coefficients are comparable. All the galaxies studied show
significant lopsidedness in HI. The mean value of $A_1$ in the inner regions of
the galaxies (1.5 - 2.5 scale lengths) is $\geq 0.2$. This value of $A_1$ is
twice the average value seen in the field galaxies. Also, the lopsidedness is
found to be smaller for late-type galaxies, this is opposite to the trend seen
in the field galaxies. These two results indicate a different physical origin
for disc lopsidedness in galaxies in a group environment compared to the field
galaxies. Further, a large fraction ($\sim$ 30%) shows a higher degree of
lopsidedness ($A_1 \geq 0.3$). It is also seen that the disk lopsidedness
increases with the radius as demonstrated in earlier studies, but over a radial
range that is two timeslarger than done in the previous studies. The average
lopsidedness of the halo potential is estimated to be $\sim 10$%, assuming that
the lopsidedness in HI disc is due to its response to the halo asymmetry.",2006-04-06T07:03:23Z
Compact X-ray Binaries in and out of Core Collapsed Globulars,"We review new Chandra and HST observations of the core collapsed cluster NGC
6397 as a guide to understanding the compact binary (CB) populations in core
collapse globulars. New cataclysmic variables (CVs) and main sequence
chromospherically active binaries (ABs) have been identified, enabling a larger
sample for comparison of the Lx, Fx/Fv and X-ray vs. optical color
distributions. Comparison of the numbers of CBs with Lx >10^31 erg/s in 4 core
collapse vs. 12 King model clusters reveals that the specific frequency Sx
(number of CBs per unit cluster mass) is enhanced in core collapse clusters,
even when normalized for their stellar encounter rate. Although core collapse
is halted by the dynamical heating due to stellar (and binary) interaction with
CBs in the core, we conclude that production of the hardest CBs -- especially
CVs -- is enhanced during core collapse. NGC 6397 has its most luminous CVs
nearest the cluster center, with two newly discovered very low luminosity (old,
quiescent) CVs far from the core. The active binaries as well as neutron star
systems (MSP and qLMXB) surround the central core. The overall CB population
appears to be asymmetric about the cluster center, as in several other core
collapse clusters observed with Chandra, suggesting still poorly-understood
scattering processes.",2006-05-04T19:26:32Z
Modelling V838 Monocerotis as a Mergeburst Object,"We discuss the main observational facts on the eruption of V838 Monocerotis

"Composite Dark Matter with Invisible Light from Almost-Commutative
  Geometry","Almost commutative geometry offers a specific way to unify general
relativity, quantum mechanics and gauge symmetries. The AC-model of elementary
particles, arising on this way, naturally embeds the Standard model and
predicts doubly charged AC-leptons, anion-like A^{--} and cathion-like C^{++},
which can bind in WIMP-like (AC)-atoms, being a nontrivial candidate for
cosmological dark matter. This state is reached in the early Universe along a
tail of more manifest secondary frozen blocks. They should be now here
polluting the surrounding matter. The main secondary relics are C^{++}
""anomalous helium"" and a bound system of A^{--} with an ordinary helium ion
(^4He)^{++}, which is able to attract and capture (in thefirst three minutes)
all the free A^{--} fixing them into a neutral OLe-helium (OHe) nuclear
interacting ""atom"" (^4He^{++}A^{--}). The model naturally involves a new U(1)
gauge interaction, possessed only by the AC-leptons and providing a
Coulomb-like attraction between them. This attraction stimulates the effective
A-C recombination into AC-atoms inside dense matter bodies (stars and planets),
resulting in a decrease of anomalous isotopes below the experimental upper
limits. OLe-helium pollution of terrestrial matter and (OHe) catalysis of
nuclear reactions in it is one of the exciting problems (or advantages?) of the
present model.",2006-03-08T10:28:01Z
The non-linear behavior of the black hole system GRS 1915+105,"Using non-linear time series analysis, along with surrogate data analysis, it
is shown that the various types of long term variability exhibited by the black
hole system GRS 1915+105, can be explained in terms of a deterministic
non-linear system with some inherent stochastic noise. Evidence is provided for
a non-linear limit cycle origin of one of the low frequency QPO detected in the
source, while some other types of variability could be due to an underlying low
dimensional chaotic system. These results imply that the partial differential
equations which govern the magneto-hydrodynamic flow of the inner accretion
disk, can be approximated by a small number ($\approx 3 -5$) of non-linear but
{\it ordinary} differential equations. While this analysis does not reveal the
exact nature of these approximate equations, they may be obtained in the
future, after results of magneto-hydrodynamic simulation of realistic accretion
disks become available.",2006-03-11T13:15:07Z
Coma revealed as an extended hard X-rays source by INTEGRAL IBIS/ISGRI,"Aims. We report the INTEGRAL/IBIS observations of the Coma Cluster in the
hard X-ray/soft-ray domain. Methods. Since the Coma Cluster appears as an
extended source, its global intensity and significance cannot be directly
extracted with standard coded mask analysis. We used the method of imaging the
extended sources with a coded mask telescope developed by Renaud et al. (2006).
Results. The imaging capabilities and the sensitivity of the IBIS/ISGRI coded
mask instrument allows us to identify for the first time the site of the
emission above ~ 15 keV. We have studied the Coma Cluster morphology in the
18-30keV band and found that it follows the prediction based on X-ray
observations.We also bring constraints on the non-thermal mechanism
contribution at higher energies.",2006-06-06T11:44:17Z

"The UV spectrum of HS1700+6416 II. FUSE observations of the HeII Lyman
  alpha forest","We present the far-UV spectrum of the quasar HS1700+6416 taken with FUSE.
This QSO provides the second line of sight with the HeII absorption resolved
into a Ly alpha forest structure. Since HS1700+6416 is slightly less redshifted
(z=2.72) than HE2347-4342, we only probe the post-reionization phase of HeII,
seen in the evolution of the HeII opacity, which is consistent with a simple
power law. The HeII/HI ratio eta is estimated using a line profile-fitting
procedure and an apparent optical depth approach, respectively. The expected
metal line absorption in the far-UV is taken into account as well as molecular
absorption of galactic H_2. About 27% of the eta values are affected by metal
line absorption. In order to investigate the applicability of the analysis
methods, we create simple artificial spectra based on the statistical
properties of the HI Ly alpha forest. The analysis of the artificial data
demonstrates that the apparent optical depth method as well as the line
profile-fitting procedure lead to confident results for restricted data samples
only (12.0 < log N(HI) < 13.0). The reasons are saturation in the case of the
apparent optical depth and thermal line widths in the case of the profile fits.
Furthermore, applying the methods to the unrestricted data set may mimic a
correlation between eta and the strength of the HI absorption. For the
restricted data samples a scatter of 10 - 15% in eta would be expected even if
the underlying value is constant. The observed scatter is significantly larger
than expected, indicating that the intergalactic radiation background is indeed
fluctuating. In the redshift range 2.58 < z < 2.72, where the data quality is
best, we find eta ~ 100, suggesting a contribution of soft sources like
galaxies to the UV background.",2006-05-05T12:07:15Z
Heavy Element Abundances in Giant Stars of 47 Tuc,"This research forms part of an investigation into heavy element abundances in
Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars in various stellar environments. Seven
giant stars in the southern globular cluster 47 Tuc have been observed using
the Anglo-Australian Telescope. Abundances for five s- and r- process elements
have been determined: the light s-process elements, Y and Zr; the heavy
s-process elements, La and Nd; and the r-process element Eu. Mean enhancements
in the light s-process, [ls/Fe], of ~+0.6 dex and heavy s-process elements,
[hs/Fe], of ~+0.3 dex were determined for all the giant stars. There was no
statistically significant difference between the abundances determined for the
Red Giant Branch (RGB) and AGB stars in this study. The results for the RGB
stars differ from those obtained by a number of previous studies. However,
because of the similar abundance results obtained for the AGB and RGB stars in
this study we believe this provides evidence for previous enrichment of the
material from which these stars formed.",2006-05-21T20:40:01Z
"The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. Variable Baseline
  Microlensing Events in the Galactic Bulge","We present the first systematic search for microlensing events with
variability in their baselines using data from the third phase of the Optical
Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE-III). A total of 137 candidates (88 new)
was discovered toward the Galactic bulge. Among these, 21 have periodic
oscillations in their baselines, 111 are irregular variables and 5 are
potential long period detached eclipsing binaries. This is about 10% of the
total number of constant baseline events. They are hence quite common and can
be regarded as a new type of exotic events, which allow the determination of
extra parameters of the events. We show that microlensing of variable stars may
allow us to break the degeneracy between the blending parameter and
magnification. We note that in some cases variability hidden in the baseline
due to strong blending may be revealed in highly magnified events and resemble
other exotic microlensing behavior, including planetary deviation. A new system
(VEWS) for detecting ongoing variable baseline microlensing events is
presented.",2006-07-07T11:22:05Z
"Highly-magnified, Multiply-imaged radio counterparts of the Sub-mm
  Starburst Emission in the Cluster-Lens MS0451.6-0305","Previous authors have reported the detection of intrinsically faint sub-mm
emission lensed by the cluster MS0451.6-0305. They suggest that this emission
arises from a merging system composed of a Ly-break galaxy and a pair of
extremely red objects which are multiply-imaged in the optical/NIR
observations. Since the submm emission presents an unusually large angular
extent (~1 arcmin), the possible radio emission asociatted with that system can
help to identify optical/NIR counterparts due to the higher spatial resolution
and astrometric accuracy of the radio observations. Archive VLA data (BnA
configuration at 1.4 GHz) was reduced and analysed. A simple lens model was
constructed to aid the interpretation of the radio and pre-existing sub-mm and
optical/NIR data. We present a 1.4 GHz map of the central region of
MS0451.6-0305 and report the detection of gravitationally lensed radio
emission, coincident with the previously discovered sub-mm lensed emission. The
overall morphology and scale of the radio and sub-mm emission are strikingly
similar, extending ~1 arcmin across the sky. This observation strongly suggests
that the radio and sub-mm emission arise from the same sources. Preliminary
estimates of the total S_850 microns/S_1.4 GHz flux density ratio appear to be
consistent with that expected from distant star forming galaxies. The radio
emission is resolved into 7 distinct components, and the overall structure can
be explained, using a simple lens model, with three multiply-imaged radio
sources at z~2.9. One of these sources is predicted to lie in the middle of the
previously mentioned system in the source plane, suggesting that it is related
to the intense star formation generated during the merging process.",2006-03-17T16:04:33Z
"Necessary and sufficient condition for hydrostatic equilibrium in
  general relativity","We present explicit examples to show that the `compatibility criterion' is
capable of providing a {\em necessary} and {\em sufficient} condition for any
regular configuration to be compatible with the state of hydrostatic
equilibrium. This conclusion is drawn on the basis of the finding that the
$M-R$ relation gives the necessary and sufficient condition for dynamical
stability of equilibrium configurations only when the compatibility criterion
for these configurations is appropriately satisfied. In this regard, we
construct an appropriate sequence composed of core-envelope models on the basis
of compatibility criterion, such that each member of this sequence satisfies
the extreme case of causality condition $v = c = 1$ at the centre. The maximum
stable value of $u \simeq 0.3389$ (which occurs for the model corresponding to
the maximum value of mass in the mass-radius relation) and the corresponding
central value of the local adiabatic index, $(\Gamma_1)_0 \simeq 2.5911$, of
this model are found fully consistent with those of the corresponding {\em
absolute} values, $u_{\rm max} \leq 0.3406$, and $(\Gamma_1)_0 \leq 2.5946$,
which impose strong constraints on these parameters of such models. In addition
to this example, we also study dynamical stability of pure adiabatic polytropic
configurations on the basis of variational method for the choice of the `trial
function', $\xi =re^{\nu/4}$, as well as the mass-central density relation,
since the compatibility criterion is appropriately satisfied for these models.
The results of this example provide additional proof in favour of the statement
regarding compatibility criterion mentioned above.",2006-06-01T11:12:18Z
Exact versus approximate beaming formulas in Gamma-Ray Burst afterglows,"We present the exact analytic expressions to compute, assuming the emitted
Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) radiation is not spherically symmetric but is confined
into a narrow jet, the value of the detector arrival time at which we start to
""see"" the sides of the jet, both in the fully radiative and adiabatic regimes.
We obtain this result using our exact analytic expressions for the EQuiTemporal
Surfaces (EQTSs) in GRB afterglows. We re-examine the validity of three
different approximate formulas currently adopted for the adiabatic regime in
the GRB literature. We also present an empirical fit of the numerical solutions
of the exact equations, compared and contrasted with the three above
approximate formulas. The extent of the differences is such as to require a
reassessment on the existence and entity of beaming in the cases considered in
the current literature, as well as on its consequences on the GRB energetics.",2006-05-12T23:14:23Z
"X-ray and IR Point Source Identification and Characteristics In the
  Embedded, Massive Star-Forming Region RCW 38","We report on results of a 96.7 ks Chandra observation of one of the youngest,
most embedded and massive young stellar clusters studied in X-rays - RCW 38. We
detect 460 sources in the field of which 360 are confirmed to be associated
with the RCW~38 cluster. The cluster members range in luminosity from ~10^30
ergs s^-1 to 10^33.5 ergs s^-1. Over ten percent of the cluster members with
over 100 counts exhibit flares while about 15% of cluster members with over 30
counts are variable. Of the sources identified as cluster members, 160 have
near-infrared (NIR) counterparts either in the 2MASS database or detected via
VLT observations. Of these about 20% appear to have optically thick disks. An
additional 353 members are identified through NIR observations of which at
least 50% possess optically thick disks. We fit over 100 X-ray sources as
absorbed Raymond-Smith type plasmas and find the column to the cluster members
varies from 10^21.5 to 10^23 per sq cm. We compare the gas to dust absorption
signatures in these stars and find Nh= A_v x 2 x 10^21 cm^-2. We find that the
cluster contains 31 candidate OB stars and is centered about 10"" (0.1 pc) west
of the primary source of the ionization, the O5 star IRS 2. The cluster has a
peak central density of about 400 X-ray sources pc^-2. We estimate that the

"Steps for Solving the Transfer Equation for Arbitrary Flows in
  Stationary Spacetimes","We derive the radiative transfer equation for arbitrary stationary
relativistic flows in stationary spacetimes, i.e. for steady-state transfer
problems. We show how the standard characteristics method of solution developed
by Mihalas and used throughout the radiative transfer community can be adapted
to multi-dimensional applications with isotropic sources. Because the
characteristics always coincide with geodesics and can always be specified by
constants, direct integration of the characteristics derived from the transfer
equation as commonly done in 1-D applications is not required. The
characteristics are known for a specified metric from the geodesics. We give
details in both flat and static spherically symmetric spacetimes. This work has
direct application in 3-dimensional simulations of supernovae, gamma-ray

curves we found rapid light variations with timescales of tens of minutes and
significant amplitudes in the well-known flickerers MWC 560, RS Oph, V407 Cyg
and T CrB. MWC 560 and V407 Cyg demonstrate quasi periodic oscillations (QPO)
with similar amplitudes and timescales. Flickering and unusual flare in V627
Cas as well as some indications of flickering presence in BX Mon are detected.
The existence of 29 minutes oscillations in Z And with an amplitude about 0.02
mag in U band is confirmed. Only one symbiotic star, V471 Per, and both non
symbiotic, CI Cam and V886 Her seem to be constant on flickering timescales.
Nevertheless, small night to night changes in the brightness of V886 Her were
observed as well.",2006-04-05T07:31:03Z
Infrared Observations of The Helix Planetary Nebula,"We have mapped the Helix (NGC 7293) planetary nebula (PN) with the IRAC
instrument on the Spitzer Space Telescope. The Helix is one of the closest
bright PN, and therefore provides an opportunity to resolve the small-scale
structure in the nebula. The emission from this PN in the 5.8 and 8 micron IRAC
bands is dominated by the pure rotational lines of molecular hydrogen, with a
smaller contribution from forbidden line emission such as [Ar III] in the
ionized region. The IRAC images resolve the ""cometary knots"" which have been
previously studied in this PN. The ""tails"" of the knots and the radial rays
extending into the outer regions of the PN are seen in emission in the IRAC
bands. IRS spectra on the main ring and the emission in the IRAC bands are
consistent with shock-excited H2 models, with a small (~10%) component from
photodissociation regions. In the Northeast Arc, the H2 emission is located in
a shell outside of the H alpha emission.",2006-07-24T15:49:01Z
"Probing Star Formation in Interacting Galaxies Using UV and Mid-IR: The
  Case of Arp 82","To help understand the effects of galaxy interactions on star formation, we
analyze Spitzer infrared and GALEX ultraviolet images of the interacting galaxy
pair Arp 82 (NGC 2535/6), and compare to a numerical simulation of the
interaction. We investigate the UV and IR properties of several star forming
regions (clumps). Using the FUV/NUV colors of the clumps we constrain the ages.
The 8 micron and 24 micron luminosities are used to estimate the far-infrared
luminosities and the star formation rates of the clumps. We investigate
possible gradients in the UV and IR colors. See Smith et al. (2006a,b) for
global results on our entire interacting sample.",2006-03-15T19:19:55Z
The recent star formation in NGC 6822 from HST imaging,"We present HST WFPC2 and STIS imaging of the low metallicity galaxy NGC 6822,
performed as part of a study of the young stellar populations in the galaxies
of the Local Group. Eleven WFPC2 pointings, with some overlap, cover two
regions, extending over 19'x19' and 13'x13' respectively, off the galaxy
center. One 25x25'' field observed with STIS' FUV- and NUV- MAMA, includes
Hodge's OB8 association and the HII region Hubble V. We derive the physical
parameters of the stars in the fields and the extinction by comparing the
photometry to grids of model magnitudes. The environments studied in this work
include one of the most luminous (in Halpha) HII regions in the Local Group
(Hubble V) with a compact star cluster, a typical OB association (OB15), the
sparse field population and the outskirts of NGC6822. The color-magnitude
diagrams show similar ages of few Myrs for both OB8 and OB15. The density [per
unit area] of hot massive stars in the core of the OB8 association is higher
than in OB15 by a factor of 12, while the total stellar mass formed is similar.
In both OB15 and OB8 massive star candidates are found. The average extinction
is found to vary among the three environments studied: E(B-V) = 0.22 in the
outer regions, E(B-V) = 0.27 in the fields East of the galaxy main bar, and
E(B-V) = 0.40 in the HII region Hubble V. A quantitative discussion of the
applicability of the reddening-free-index method for photometric determination
of stellar parameters is provided for the filters used in this work, based on
our grids of stellar models.",2006-05-14T21:27:39Z
Planetary Nebulae as Mass Tracers in Galaxies,"Planetary nebula are useful kinematic tracers of the stars in all galaxy
types. I review recent observationally-driven developments in the study of
galaxy mass profiles. These have yielded surprising results on spiral galaxy
disk masses and elliptical galaxy halo masses. A key remaining question is the
coupling between PNe and the underlying stellar populations.",2006-05-10T21:00:35Z
Probing Primordial Magnetic Fields with the 21cm Fluctuations,"Primordial magnetic fields possibly generated in the very early universe are
one of the candidates for the origin of magnetic fields observed in many
galaxies and galaxy clusters. After recombination, the dissipation process of
the primordial magnetic fields increases the baryon temperature. The Lorentz
force acts on the residual ions and electrons to generate density fluctuations.
These effects are imprinted on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) brightness
temperature fluctuations produced by the neutral hydrogen 21cm line. We
calculate the angular power spectrum of brightness temperature fluctuations for
the model with the primordial magnetic fields of a several nano Gauss strength
and a power-law spectrum. It is found that the overall amplitude and the shape
of the brightness temperature fluctuations depend on the strength and the
spectral index of the primordial magnetic fields. Therefore, it is expected
that the observations of the CMB brightness temperature fluctuations give us a
strong constraint on the primordial magnetic fields.",2006-07-10T08:08:25Z
Perspectives of High Energy Neutrino Astronomy,"This work discusses the perspectives to observe fluxes of high energy
astrophysical neutrinos with the planned km3 telescopes. On the basis of the
observations of GeV and TeV gamma-rays, and of ultra high energy cosmic rays,
it is possible to construct well motivated predictions that indicate that the
discovery of such fluxes is probable. However the range of these predictions is
broad, and the very important opening of the ``neutrino window'' on the high
energy universe is not guaranteed with the current design of the detectors. The
problem of enlarging the detector acceptance using the same (water/ice
Cherenkov) or alternative (acoustic/radio) techniques is therefore of central
importance.",2006-05-21T15:20:20Z
Flux predictions of high-energy neutrinos from pulsars,"Young, rapidly rotating neutron stars could accelerate ions from their
surface to energies of $\sim 1$ PeV. If protons reach such energies, they will
produce pions (with low probability) through resonant scattering with x-rays
from the stellar surface. The pions subsequently decay to produce muon
neutrinos. Here we calculate the energy spectrum of muon neutrinos, and
estimate the event rates at Earth. The spectrum consists of a sharp rise at
$\sim 50$ TeV, corresponding to the onset of the resonance, above which the
flux drops with neutrino energy as $\epsilon_\nu^{-2}$ up to an upper-energy
cut-off that is determined by either kinematics or by the maximum energy to
which protons are accelerated. We estimate event rates as high as 10-100
km^${-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ from some candidates, a flux that would be easily detected
by IceCube. Lack of detection would allow constraints on the energetics of the
poorly-understood pulsar magnetosphere.",2006-04-18T14:13:55Z
"All-wavelength Extended Groth strip International Survey: the
  environment of X-ray sources at z~1","We explore the environment of z~1 AGN using a sample of 53 spectroscopically
identified X-ray sources in the All-wavelength Extended Groth strip
International Survey. We quantify the local density in the vicinity of an X-ray
source by measuring the projected surface density of spectroscopically
identified optical galaxies within a radius defined by the 3rd nearest
neighbour. Our main result is that X-ray selected AGN at z~1 avoid underdense
regions at the 99.89% confidence level. Moreover, although we find that the
overall population shares the same (rich) environment with optical galaxies of
similar U-B and M_B, there is also tentative evidence (96%) that AGN with blue
colors (U-B<1) reside in denser environments compared to optical galaxies. We
argue that the results above are a consequence of the whereabouts of massive
galaxies, capable of hosting supermassive black holes at their centers, with
available cold gas reservoirs, the fuel for AGN activity. At z~1 an increasing
fraction of such systems are found in dense regions.",2006-07-12T20:53:14Z
Effects of sedimented helium on the X-ray properties of galaxy clusters,"In this Letter, we consider the role played by the sedimentation of helium
nuclei on the emissivity and metallicity distribution of the X-ray emitting
plasma in the cores of relaxed galaxy clusters. We model the gas density and
temperature profiles of nearby cooling core clusters to estimate the
gravitational acceleration acting on the helium and show that its sedimentation
time scale is too long with respect to the present age of these objects to play
a significant role. However, we argue that these time scales have to be
definitely lower in the past allowing the helium to settle in the cluster
cooling cores and raise its abundance to values higher than the solar one. A
direct consequence of this speculation is that the helium, by increasing the
total X-ray emissivity, reduces the measured metal abundance in the inner (r <
20 kpc) cluster regions.",2006-03-15T08:53:12Z
"The Hubble diagram extended to z>>1: the gamma-ray properties of GRBs
  confirm the Lambda-CDM model","Tight constraints on cosmological parameters can be obtained with standard
candles spanning a range of redshifts as large as possible. We propose to treat
SN Ia and long Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) as a single class of candles. Taking
advantage of the recent release of the Supernova Legacy Survey and {\it the
recent finding of a tight correlation among the energetics and other prompt
gamma-ray emission properties of GRBs}, we are able to standardize the
luminosities/energetics of both classes of objects. In this way we can jointly
use GRB and SNIa as cosmological probes to constrain Omega_m and Omega_L and
the Dark Energy equation of state parameters through the same Bayesian method
that we have, so far, applied to GRBs alone. Despite the large disparity in
number (115 SNIa versus 19 GRBs) we show that the constraints on Omega_m and
Omega_L are greatly improved by the inclusion of GRBs. More importantly, the
result of the combined sample is in excellent agreement with the Lambda-CDM
concordance cosmological model and does not require an evolving equation of
state for the Dark Energy.",2006-05-17T20:00:37Z
"Constraining Primordial Non-Gaussianities from the WMAP2 2-1 Cumulant
  Correlator Power Spectrum","We measure the 2-1 cumulant correlator power spectrum $C^{21}_l$, a
degenerate bispectrum, from the second data release of the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). Our high resolution measurements with SpICE span a
large configuration space ($\simeq 168\times999$) corresponding to the possible
cross-correlations of the maps recorded by the different differencing
assemblies. We present a novel method to recover the eigenmodes of the
correspondingly large Monte Carlo covariance matrix. We examine its eigenvalue
spectrum and use random matrix theory to show that the off diagonal terms are
dominated by noise. We minimize the $\chi^2$ to obtain constraints for the
non-linear coupling parameter $f_{NL} = 22 \pm 52 (1\sigma)$.",2006-06-16T01:58:34Z
"Tidal tails around globular clusters: are they good tracers of cluster
  orbits?","In the last decade, observational studies have shown the existence of tidal
streams in the outer part of many galactic globular clusters. The most striking
examples of clusters with well defined tidal tails are represented by Palomar 5
and NGC 5466 (both observed in the framework of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey),
which show structures elongated for 4 kpc and 1 kpc in length, respectively.
Unfortunately, most of the observational studies about globular clusters (GCs)
do not cover such a large field of the sky as the SDSS does. In this framework,
by mean of a parallel, adaptive tree-code, we performed detailed N-body
simulations of GCs moving in a realistic three-components (bulge, disk and
halo) Milky Way potential, in order to clarify whether and to what extent tails
in the clusters outer regions (few tidal radii) are tracers of the local orbits
and, also, if some kind of correlation exists among the cluster orbital phase
and the orientation of such streams.",2006-05-10T08:21:50Z
Primordial Black Hole Minimum Mass,"In this paper we revisit thermodynamic constraints on primordial black hole
(PBH) formation in the early universe. Under the assumption that PBH mass is
equal to the cosmological horizon mass, one can use the 2nd Law of
Thermodynamics to put a lower limit on the PBH mass. In models of PBH
formation, however, PBHs are created at some fraction of the horizon mass. We
show that this thermodynamic constraint still holds for sub-horizon PBH
formation.",2006-04-07T19:24:42Z
Nonminimal Inflation and the Running Spectral Index,"We study a class of models in which the inflaton is minimally coupled to
gravity with a term $f(R)\vp^2$. We focus in particular on the case when $f\sim
R^2$, the expansion of the scale factor is driven by the usual potential
energy, while the rolling of the inflaton is driven by the nonminial coupling.
We show that the power spectrum is in general blue, and the problem of getting
a running spectral index is eased. However, the inflaton potential must have a
large second derivative in order to get a large running.",2006-07-24T12:01:02Z
Nearby AGN and their hosts in the near infrared,"We present near infrared ISAAC VLT observations of nine (0.01<z<0.06) Active
Galactic Nuclei selected from the Hamburg/ESO Survey and the Veron-Cetty &
Veron catalog. Hydrogen recombination lines Pa$\alpha$ and Br$\gamma$ are
observed in seven of the nine sources of which five show a broad component. In
three sources, extended 1-0S(1) rotational-vibrational molecular hydrogen
emission is detected. Stellar CO absorption is seen in four sources. In one of
these objects, an upper limit of the central mass can be determined from the
stellar velocity field. H- and Ks-band imaging allow us to determine the
morphology class of the host galaxies. Colors (with supplementary J-band 2MASS
images) show that the four galaxies with detected CO absorption are
characterized by an overall strong stellar contribution. One galaxy shows an
increased extinction towards the nucleus. After removal of the nuclear point
source, the host galaxies show colors typical for non-active spiral galaxies.",2006-03-13T12:34:42Z
"Number counts and clustering properties of bright Distant Red Galaxies
  in the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey Early Data Release","We describe the number counts and spatial distribution of 239 Distant Red
Galaxies (DRGs), selected from the Early Data Release of the UKIDSS Ultra Deep
Survey. The DRGs are identified by their very red infrared colours with
(J-K)AB>1.3, selected over 0.62 sq degree to a 90% completeness limit of
KAB~20.7. This is the first time a large sample of bright DRGs has been studied
within a contiguous area, and we provide the first measurements of their number
counts and clustering. The population shows strong angular clustering,
intermediate between those of K-selected field galaxies and
optical/infrared-selected Extremely Red Galaxies. Adopting the redshift
distributions determined from other recent studies, we infer a high correlation
length of r0~11 h-1 Mpc. Such strong clustering could imply that our galaxies
are hosted by very massive dark matter halos, consistent with the progenitors
of present-day L>L* elliptical galaxies.",2006-06-15T18:59:23Z
"Vector current conservation and neutrino emission from singlet-paired
  baryons in neutron stars","Neutrino emission caused by singlet Cooper pairing of baryons in neutron
stars is recalculated by accurately taking into account for conservation of the
vector weak currents. The neutrino emissivity via the vector weak currents is
found to be several orders of magnitude smaller than that obtained before by
different authors. This makes unimportant the neutrino radiation from singlet
pairing of protons or hyperons.",2006-06-27T12:32:33Z
Late-time Inhomogeneity and the Acceleration of the Universe,"The inhomogeneous distribution of matter in the non-linear regime of
galaxies, clusters of galaxies and voids is described by an exact, spherically
symmetric inhomogeneous solution of Einstein's gravitational field equations,
corresponding to an under-dense void. The solution becomes the homogeneous and
isotropic Einstein-de Sitter solution for a red shift $z > 10-20$, which
describes the matter dominated CMB data with small inhomogeneities. A spatial
volume averaging of physical quantities is introduced and the averaged time
evolution expansion parameter $\theta$ can give rise in the late-time universe
to a volume averaged deceleration parameter $<q>$ that is negative for a
positive matter density. This allows for a region of accelerated expansion
which does not require a cosmological constant. A negative deceleration
parameter can be derived by this volume averaging procedure from the
Lema\^{i}tre-Tolman-Bondi open void solution, which describes the late-time
non-linear regime associated with galaxies and under-dense voids and solves the
``coincidence'' problem.",2006-03-28T23:15:09Z
Radiatively-Driven Cosmology in the Cellular Automaton Universe,"This is an updated version of my paper ""An outline of radiatively-driven
cosmology"" (Kurucz 2000). Here the Big Bang universe is replaced by a finite
cellular automaton universe with no expansion (Kurucz 2006). The Big Bang is
replaced by many little bangs spread throughout the universe that interact to
produce the initial perturbations that form Population III stars, globular
clusters, and galaxies, but no large-scale structure. These perturbations
evolve into the universe as we now observe it. Evolution during the first
billion years is controlled by radiation. Globular clusters are formed by
radiatively-driven implosions, galaxies are formed by radiatively-triggered
gravitational collapse of systems of globular clusters, and voids and the
microwave background are formed by radiatively-driven expansion. After this
period most of the strong radiation sources are exhausted and the universe
relaxes into gravitational old age as we know it. To relieve the boredom we
present the results of gedanken experiments (Kurucz 1992) in a traditional,
linear, chronological sequence in the hope of stimulating research on the many
topics considered.",2006-05-18T19:48:35Z
Cosmic Conspiracies,"The now standard vanilla-flavoured LambdaCDM model has gained further
confirmation with the release of the 3-year WMAP data combined with several
other cosmological data-sets. As the parameters of this standard model become
known with increasing precision, more of its bizarre features become apparent.
Here we describe some of the strangest of these ostensible coincidences. In
particular we appear to live (within 1sigma) at the precise epoch when the age
of the Universe multiplied by the Hubble parameter H_0 t_0 = 1.",2006-04-02T06:36:24Z
An XMM-Newton Observation of the Massive Edge-on Sb Galaxy NGC 2613,"We present an XMM-Newton observation of the massive edge-on Sb galaxy NGC
2613. We discover that this galaxy contains a deeply embedded active nucleus
with a 0.3-10 keV luminosity of 3.3x10^40 erg/s and a line-of-sight absorption
column of 1.2x10^23 cm^-2. Within the 25 mag/arcsec^2 optical B-band isophote
of the galaxy, we detect an additional 4 sources with an accumulated luminosity
of 4.3x10^39 erg/s. The bulk of the unresolved X-ray emission spatially follows
the near-infrared (NIR) K-band surface brightness distribution; the luminosity
ratio L_X/L_K ~ 8x10^-4 is consistent with that inferred from galactic discrete
sources. This X-ray-NIR association and the compatibility of the X-ray spectral
fit with the expected spectrum of a population of discrete sources suggest that
low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) are the most likely emitters of the unresolved
emission in the disk region. The remaining unresolved emission is primarily due
to extraplanar hot gas. The luminosity of this gas is at least a factor of 10
less than that predicted by recent simulations of intergalactic gas accretion
by such a massive galaxy with a circular rotation speed V_c ~ 304 km/s^2 (Toft
et al. 2002). Instead, we find that the extraplanar hot gas most likely
represents discrete extensions away from the disk, including two
``bubble-like'' features on either side of the nucleus. These extensions appear
to correlate with radio continuum emission and, energetically, can be easily
explained by outflows from the galactic disk.",2006-06-21T23:07:07Z
Interacting models of soft coincidence,"The coincidence problem of late cosmic acceleration is a serious riddle in
connection with our understanding of the evolution of the Universe. In this
paper we show that an interaction between the dark energy component (either
phantom or quintessence) and dark matter can alleviate it. In this scenario the
baryon component is independently conserved. This generalizes a previous study
[S. del Campo, R. Herrera, and D. Pavon, Phys. Rev. D 71, 123529 (2005)] in
which neither baryons nor phantom energy were considered.",2006-06-21T13:21:35Z
"Who Is Eating the Outflow?: High-Angular Resolution Study of an
  Intermediate-Mass Protostar in L1206","Up to now only a few intermediate-mass molecular outflows have been studied
with enough high-angular resolution. The aim of this work is to study in detail
the intermediate-mass YSO IRAS 22272+6358A, which is embedded in L1206, and its
molecular outflow, in order to investigate the interaction of the outflow with
the dense protostellar material, and to compare their properties with those of
lower mas counterparts. We carried out OVRO observations of the 2.7 mm
continuum emission, CO(1-0), C18O(1-0), and HC3N(12-11) in order to map with
high-angular resolution the core of L1206, and to derive the properties of the
dust emission, the molecular outflow and the dense protostellar envelope. The
2.7 mm continuum emission has been resolved into four sources, labeled OVRO~1,
2, 3, and 4. The intermediate-mass Class~0/I object OVRO 2, with a mass traced
by the dust emission of 14.2 Msun, is the source associated with IRAS
22272+6358A. The CO(1-0) observations have revealed a very collimated outflow
driven by OVRO 2, at a PA ~140 degr, that has a very weak southeastern red lobe
and a much stronger northwestern blue lobe. Photodissociation toward the red
lobe produced by the ionization front coming from the bright-rimmed diffuse HII
region could be responsible of the morphology of the outflow. The spatial
correlation between the outflow and the elongated dense protostellar material
traced by HC3N(12-11) suggests an interaction between the molecular outflow and
the protostellar envelope. Shocks produced by the molecular outflow, and
possibly by the shock front preceding the ionization front could account for
the southern enhancement of HC3N. The properties of the intermediate-mass
protostar OVRO 2 and the molecular outflow are consistent with those of lower
mass counterparts.",2006-04-03T14:04:48Z
Dark Matter Halos with Cores from Hierarchical Structure Formation,"We show that dark matter emerging from late decays (z < 1000) produces a
linear power spectrum identical to that of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) on all
observationally relavant scales (> 0.1 Mpc), and simultaneously generates
observable constant-density cores in small dark matter halos. We refer to this
class of models as meta-Cold Dark Matter (mCDM), because it is born with
non-relativistic velocities from the decays of cold thermal relics. The
constant-density cores are a result of the low phase-space density of mCDM at
birth. Warm dark matter cannot produce similar size phase-space limited cores
without saturating the Ly-alpha power spectrum bounds. Dark matter dominated
galaxy rotation curves and stellar velocity dispersion profiles may provide the
best means to discriminate between mCDM and CDM. mCDM candidates are motivated
by the particle spectrum of supersymmetric and extra dimensional extensions to
the standard model of particle physics.",2006-06-12T23:48:22Z
"Dynamics of the NGC 4636 Globular Cluster System - An extremely dark
  matter dominated galaxy?","We present the first dynamical study of the globular cluster system of NGC
4636. This giant elliptical galaxy is claimed to be extremely dark matter
dominated, according to X-ray observations. Using the VLT with FORS2/MXU, we
obtained velocities for 174 globular clusters. The clusters have projected
galactocentric distances in the range 4 to 70 kpc, the overwhelming majority
lie within 30 kpc. We find some indication for a rotation of the red
(metal-rich) clusters about the minor axis. Out to a radius of 30 kpc, we find
a roughly constant projected velocity dispersion for the blue clusters of ~200
km/s. The red clusters exhibit a distinctly different behavior: at a radius of
about 13 kpc, the velocity dispersion drops by ~50 km/s to about 170 km/s which
then remains constant out to a radius of 30 kpc.
  Using only the blue clusters as dynamical tracers, we perform Jeans-analyses
for different assumptions of the orbital anisotropy. Depending on the
anisotropy and the adopted M/L-values, we find that the dark matter fraction
within one effective radius can vary between 20% and 50% with most a probable
range between 20% and 30%. A main source of uncertainty is the ambiguity of the
velocity dispersion in the outermost bin.
  Although the dark halo mass still cannot be strongly constrained, NGC 4636
does not seem to be extremely dark matter dominated. The derived circular
velocities are also consistent with Modified Newtonian Dynamics.",2006-04-13T17:35:57Z
"Halo and Galaxy Formation Histories from the Millennium Simulation:
  Public release of a VO-oriented and SQL-queryable database for studying the
  evolution of galaxies in the LambdaCDM cosmogony","The Millennium Run is the largest simulation of the formation of structure
within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmogony so far carried out. It uses $10^{10}$
particles to follow the dark matter distribution in a cubic region
500$h^{-1}$Mpc on a side, and has a spatial resolution of 5 $h^{-1}$kpc.
Application of simplified modelling techniques to the stored output of this
calculation allows the formation and evolution of the $\sim 10^7$ galaxies more
luminous than the Small Magellanic Cloud to be simulated for a variety of
assumptions about the detailed physics involved. As part of the activities of
the German Astrophysical Virtual Observatory we have used a relational database
to store the detailed assembly histories both of all the haloes and subhaloes
resolved by the simulation, and of all the galaxies that form within these
structures for two independent models of the galaxy formation physics. We have
created web applications that allow users to query these databases remotely
using the standard Structured Query Language (SQL). This allows easy access to
all properties of the galaxies and halos, as well as to the spatial and
temporal relations between them and their environment. Information is output in
table format compatible with standard Virtual Observatory tools and protocols.
With this announcement we are making these structures fully accessible to all
users. Interested scientists can learn SQL, gain familiarity with the database
design and test queries on a small, openly accessible version of the Millennium
Run (with volume 1/512 that of the full simulation). They can then request
accounts to run similar queries on the databases for the full simulations.",2006-08-01T13:29:24Z
A Time Variation of Proton-Electron Mass Ratio and Grand Unification,"Astrophysical observations indicate a time variation of the proton-electron
mass ratio and of the fine-structure constant. We discuss this phenomenon in
models of Grand Unification. In these models a time variation of the
fine-structure constant and of the proton mass are expected, if either the
unified coupling constant or the scale of unification changes, or both change.
We discuss in particular the change of the proton mass. Experiments in Quantum
Optics could be done to check these ideas.",2006-05-09T13:09:47Z
"The Excitation of N$_2$H$^+$ in Interstellar Molecular Clouds. I -
  Models","We present LVG and non-local radiative transfer calculations involving the
rotational and hyperfine structure of the spectrum of N$_2$H$^+$ with
collisional rate coefficients recently derived by us. The goal of this study is
to check the validity of the assumptions made to treat the hyperfine structure
and to study the physical mechanisms leading to the observed hyperfine
anomalies.
  We find that the usual hypothesis of identical excitation temperatures for
all hyperfine components of the $J$=1-0 transition is not correct within the
range of densities existing in cold dense cores, i.e., a few 10$^4$ $\textless$
n(H$_2$) $\textless$ a few 10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$. This is due to different radiative
trapping effects in the hyperfine components. Moreover, within this range of
densities and considering the typical abundance of N$_2$H$^+$, the total
opacity of rotational lines has to be derived taking into account the hyperfine
structure. The error made when only considering the rotational energy structure
can be as large as 100%. Using non-local models we find that, due to
saturation, hyperfine anomalies appear as soon as the total opacity of the
$J$=1-0 transition becomes larger than $\simeq$ 20. Radiative scattering in
less dense regions enhance these anomalies, and particularly, induce a
differential increase of the excitation temperatures of the hyperfine
components. This process is more effective for the transitions with the highest
opacities for which emerging intensities are also reduced by self-absorption
effects. These effects are not as critical as in HCO$^+$ or HCN, but should be
taken into account when interpreting the spatial extent of the N$_2$H$^+$
emission in dark clouds.",2006-06-20T12:57:26Z
On the evolution of the resonant planetary system HD128311,"A significant number of the known multiple exoplanetary systems are
containing a pair of giant planets engaged in a low order mean motion
resonance. Such a resonant condition protects the dynamics of these planets
resulting in very stable orbits. According to recent studies the capture into a
resonance is the result of a planetary migration process induced by the
interaction of the planets with a protoplanetary disk. If the migration is slow
enough (adiabatic) next to a mean motion resonance, the two planets will also
be in apsidal corotation.
  The recently refined orbital parameters of the system HD 128311 suggest that
the two giant planets are in a 2:1 mean motion resonance, however without
exhibiting apsidal corotation. Thus the evolution of this system can not be
described by an adiabatic migration process alone.
  We present possible evolution scenarios of this system combining migration
processes and sudden perturbations. We model migration scenarios through
numerical integration of the gravitational N-body problem with additional
non-conservative forces. Planet-planet scattering has been investigated by
N-body simulations.
  We show that the present dynamical state of the system HD128311 may be
explained by such evolutionary processes.",2006-03-24T11:12:01Z
"Whole Earth Telescope observations of the pulsating subdwarf B star PG
  0014+067","PG 0014+067 is one of the most promising pulsating subdwarf B stars for
seismic analysis, as it has a rich pulsation spectrum. The richness of its
pulsations, however, poses a fundamental challenge to understanding the
pulsations of these stars, as the mode density is too complex to be explained
only with radial and nonradial low degree (l < 3) p-modes without rotational
splittings. One proposed solution, for the case of PG 0014+067 in particular,
assigns some modes with high degree (l=3). On the other hand, theoretical
models of sdB stars suggest that they may retain rapidly rotating cores, and so
the high mode density may result from the presence of a few rotationally-split
triplet (l=1), quintuplet (l=2) modes, along with radial (l=0) p-modes. To
examine alternative theoretical models for these stars, we need better
frequency resolution and denser longitude coverage. Therefore, we observed this
star with the Whole Earth Telescope for two weeks in October 2004. In this
paper we report the results of Whole Earth Telescope observations of the
pulsating subdwarf B star PG 0014+067. We find that the frequencies seen in PG
0014+067 do not appear to fit any theoretical model currently available;
however, we find a simple empirical relation that is able to match all of the
well-determined frequencies in this star.",2006-04-14T17:30:24Z
"A strong $\ddotν - \dotν$ correlation in radio pulsars with
  implications for torque variations","We present an analysis of the spin-down parameters for 131 radio pulsars for
which $\ddot\nu$ has been well determined. These pulsars have characteristic
ages ranging from $10^{3} - 10^{8}$ yr and spin periods in the range 0.4--30 s;
nearly equal numbers of pulsars have $\ddot\nu>0$ as $\ddot\nu<0$. We find a
strong correlation of $\ddot\nu$ with $\dot{\nu}$, {\em independent of the sign
of} $\ddot\nu$. We suggest that this trend can be accounted for by small,
stochastic deviations in the spin-down torque that are directly proportional
(in magnitude) to the spin-down torque.",2006-05-16T08:56:06Z
"High spatial resolution mid-infrared spectroscopy of the starburst
  galaxies NGC 3256, IIZw40 and Henize 2-10","In order to show the importance of high spatial resolution observations of
extra-galactic sources when compared to observations obtained with larger
apertures such as ISO, we present N-band spectra (8-13 um) of some locations in
three starburst galaxies. In particular, the two galactic nuclei of the spiral
galaxy NGC3256, the compact IR supernebula in the dwarf galaxy IIZw40 and the
two brightest IR knots in the central starburst of the WR galaxy He2-10. The
spectra have been obtained with TIMMI2 on the ESO 3.6m telescope. An inventory
of the spectra in terms of atomic fine-structure lines and molecular bands is
presented. We show the great value of these high spatial resolution data at
constraining properties such as the extinction in the mid-IR, metallicity or
stellar content (age, IMF, etc.). Regarding this, we have constrained the
stellar content of the IR compact knot in IIZw40 by using the mid-IR
fine-structure lines and setting restrictions on the nebular geometry.
Considering the PAH bands, we have constructed a new mid-/far-IR diagnostic
diagram based on the 11.2 um PAH and continuum, accessible to ground-based
observations. Finally, we find a dependence between the presence or
non-presence of PAHs and the hardness of the radiation field as measured by the
[SIV]/[NeII] ratio. In particular, sources with PAH emission have in general a
[SIV]/[NeII] ratio < 0.35. We investigate possible origins for this relation
and conclude that it does not necessarily imply PAH destruction, but could also
be explained by the PAH-dust competition for FUV photons.",2006-05-05T15:35:25Z
URAT: astrometric requirements and design history,"The U.S. Naval Observatory Robotic Astrometric Telescope (URAT) project aims
at a highly accurate (5 mas), ground-based, all-sky survey. Requirements are
presented for the optics and telescope for this 0.85 m aperture, 4.5 degree
diameter field-of-view, specialized instrument, which are close to the
capability of the industry. The history of the design process is presented as
well as astrometric performance evaluations of the toleranced, optical design,
with expected wavefront errors included.",2006-06-08T13:01:50Z
Tachyon dark energy models: dynamics and constraints,"We explore the dynamics of dark energy models based on a Dirac-Born-Infeld
(DBI) tachyonic action, studying a range of potentials. We numerically
investigate the existence of tracking behaviour and determine the present-day
value of the equation of state parameter and its running, which are compared
with observational bounds. We find that tachyon models have quite similar
phenomenology to canonical quintessence models. While some potentials can be
selected amongst many possibilities and fine-tuned to give viable scenarios,
there is no apparent advantage in choosing a DBI scalar field instead of a
Klein-Gordon one.",2006-06-01T17:46:21Z
The Host Galaxies and Classification of Active Galactic Nuclei,"We present an analysis of the host properties of 85224 emission-line galaxies
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We show that Seyferts and LINERs form
clearly separated branches on the standard optical diagnostic diagrams. We
derive a new empirical classification scheme which cleanly separates
star-forming galaxies, composite AGN-HII galaxies, Seyferts and LINERs and we
study the host galaxy properties of these different classes of objects. LINERs
are older, more massive, less dusty and more concentrated, and have higher
velocity dispersions and lower [OIII] luminosities than Seyfert galaxies. We
consider the quantity L[OIII]/sigma^4, which is an indicator of the black hole
accretion rate relative to the Eddington rate. Remarkably, we find that at
fixed L[OIII]/sigma^4, all differences between Seyfert and LINER host
properties disappear. LINERs and Seyferts form a continuous sequence, with
LINERs dominant at low L/L(EDD) and Seyferts dominant at high L/L(EDD). These
results suggest that the majority of LINERs are AGN and that the Seyfert/LINER
dichotomy is analogous to the high/low-state transition for X-ray binary
systems. We apply theoretical photoionization models and show that pure LINERs
require a harder ionizing radiation field with lower ionization parameter than
Seyfert galaxies, consistent with the low and high X-ray binary states.",2006-05-29T16:43:19Z
Far-IR Detection Limits II: Probing Confusion including Source Confusion,"We present a comprehensive analysis for the determination of the confusion
levels for the current and the next generation of far-infrared surveys assuming
three different cosmological evolutionary scenarios. We include an extensive
model for diffuse emission from infrared cirrus in order to derive absolute
sensitivity levels taking into account the source confusion noise due to point
sources, the sky confusion noise due to the diffuse emission, and instrumental
noise. We use our derived sensitivities to suggest best survey strategies for
the current and the future far-infrared space missions Spitzer, AKARI
(ASTRO-F), Herschel, and SPICA. We discuss whether the theoretical estimates
are realistic and the competing necessities of reliability and completeness. We
find the best estimator for the representation of the source confusion and
produce predictions for the source confusion using far-infrared source count
models. From these confusion limits considering both source and sky confusions,
we obtain the optimal, confusion limited redshift distribution for each
mission. Finally, we predict the Cosmic Far-Infrared Background (CFIRB) which
includes information about the number and distribution of the contributing
sources.",2006-03-07T15:59:40Z
Force-Free Electrodynamics of Pulsars,"We show that FFE (Force-Free Electrodynamics) describes pulsar magnetospheres
-- even when radiation and particle wind power are comparable to the spin-down
power. At the same time, we show that FFE is insufficient for calculating
pulsar magnetospheres. This is because FFE admits a large family of stationary
solutions with different currents flowing in the closed line region. To choose
the actual solution one needs a model of current generation which goes beyond
pure FFE.
  We calculate several FFE magnetospheres for the aligned rotator. The Poynting
power of these solutions fills the range $c^{-3}\mu ^2\Omega^4~< ~L~ <~ 0.67
c^{-3}\mu ^2\Omega^4(c/\Omega R_s)^2$, for angular velocity $\Omega$ and
magnetic field which is a pure dipole $\mu$ on the surface of the star of
radius $R_s$.
  Anomalous braking indices of young pulsars might be explained by currents
flowing in the closed-line region.",2006-04-17T23:19:29Z
"Weighing the Universe with Photometric Redshift Surveys and the Impact
  on Dark Energy Forecasts","With a wariness of Occam's razor awakened by the discovery of cosmic
acceleration, we abandon the usual assumption of zero mean curvature and ask
how well it can be determined by planned surveys. We also explore the impact of
uncertain mean curvature on forecasts for the performance of planned dark
energy probes. We find that weak lensing and photometric baryon acoustic
oscillation data, in combination with CMB data, can determine the mean
curvature well enough that the residual uncertainty does not degrade
constraints on dark energy. We also find that determinations of curvature are
highly tolerant of photometric redshift errors.",2006-05-21T18:00:59Z
"A New Measurement of the Stellar Mass Density at z~5: Implications for
  the Sources of Cosmic Reionization","We present a new measurement of the integrated stellar mass per comoving
volume at redshift 5 determined via spectral energy fitting drawn from a sample
of 214 photometrically-selected galaxies with z'<26.5 in the southern GOODS
field. Following procedures introduced by Eyles et al. (2005), we estimate
stellar masses for various sub-samples for which reliable and unconfused
Spitzer IRAC detections are available. A spectroscopic sample of 14 of the most
luminous sources with <z>=4.92 provides a firm lower limit to the stellar mass
density of 1e6 Msun/Mpc^3. Several galaxies in this sub-sample have masses of
order 10^11 Msun implying significant earlier activity occurred in massive
systems. We then consider a larger sample whose photometric redshifts in the
publicly-available GOODS-MUSIC catalog lie in the range 4.4 <z 5.6. Before
adopting the GOODS-MUSIC photometric redshifts, we check the accuracy of their
photometry and explore the possibility of contamination by low-z galaxies and
low-mass stars. After excising probable stellar contaminants and using the z'-J
color to exclude any remaining foreground red galaxies, we conclude that 196
sources are likely to be at z~5. The implied mass density from the unconfused
IRAC fraction of this sample, scaled to the total available, is 6e6 Msun/Mpc^3.
We discuss the uncertainties as well as the likelihood that we have
underestimated the true mass density. Including fainter and quiescent sources
the total integrated density could be as high as 1e7 Msun/Mpc^3. Using the
currently available (but highly uncertain) rate of decline in the star
formationhistory over 5 <z< 10, a better fit is obtained for the assembled mass
at z~5 if we admit significant dust extinction at early times or extend the
luminosity function to very faint limits. [abridged]",2006-04-12T19:41:03Z
"Dissecting Galaxy Colors with GALEX, SDSS, and Spitzer","We combine data from SDSS and the GALEX and Spitzer observatories to create a
sample of galaxies observed homogeneously from the UV to the Far-IR. This
sample, consisting of ~460 galaxies observed spectroscopically by SDSS provides
a multiwavelength (0.15-24 micron) view of obscured and unobscured star
formation in nearby (z<0.3) galaxies with SFRs ranging from 0.01 to 100
M_solar/yr. We calculate a robust dust measure from the infrared to UV ratio
(IRX) and explore the influence of star formation history (SFH) on the dust-UV
color relation (i.e. the IRX-beta relation). We find that the UV colors of
galaxies are only weakly dependent on their SFH as measured by the 4000A break.
However, we find that the contributions of dust and SFH are distinguishable
when colors at widely separated wavelengths (e.g. 0.23-3.6 micron) are
introduced. We show this explicitly by recasting the IRX-beta relation as a
more general IRX-SFH-color relation, which we examine in different projections.
We also determine simple fits to this relation.",2006-05-18T21:21:20Z
"On the Distance to the Bright Nonthermal Radio Sources in the Direction
  of an Extraordinarily Massive Cluster of Red Giants","An extraordinarily massive cluster of red supergiants has been recently
reported in the direction of the galactic coordinates $l = 25\rlap.^\circ3$; $b
= -0\rlap.^\circ2$. This cluster is associated with an X-ray source, a very
high-energy $\gamma$-ray source, and three bright non-thermal radio sources.
The \sl a priori \rm probability of these associations being only line-of-sight
coincidences is very small. However, we have analyzed VLA archive data taken
toward these three radio sources and find from their HI absorption spectra that
they are extragalactic and thus not directly associated with the galactic
cluster.",2006-04-07T14:40:53Z
The Discovery of Cepheids and a Distance to NGC 5128,"We discuss a new distance to NGC 5128 (Centaurus A) based on Cepheid
variables observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Twelve F555W (V) and six
F814W (I) epochs of cosmic-ray-split Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 observations
were obtained. A total of 56 bona-fide Cepheids were discovered, with periods
ranging from 5 to ~50 days; five of these are likely Population II Cepheids of
the W Virginis class, associated with the bulge or halo of NGC 5128. Based on
the period and V and I-band luminosities of a sub-sample of 42 classical (Pop
I) Cepheids, and adopting a Large Magellanic Cloud distance modulus and
extinction of 18.50 +/- 0.10 mag and E(B-V)=0.10 mag, respectively, the true
reddening-corrected distance modulus to NGC 5128 is mu_0 = 27.67 +/- 0.12
(random)+/- 0.16 (systematic) mag, corresponding to a distance of 3.42 +/- 0.18
(random) +/- 0.25 (systematic) Mpc. The random uncertainty in the distance is
dominated by the error on the assumed value for the ratio of total to selective
absorption, R_V, in NGC 5128, and by the possible metallicity dependence of the
Cepheid Period-Luminosity relation at V and I. This represent the first
determination of a Cepheid distance to an early-type galaxy.",2006-05-29T20:17:33Z
Star formation through gravitational collapse and competitive accretion,"Competitive accretion, a process to explain the origin of the IMF, occurs
when stars in a common gravitational potential accrete from a distributed
gaseous component. We show that concerns recently raised on the efficiency of
competitive accretion are incorrect as they use globally averaged properties
which are inappropriate for the detailed physics of a forming stellar cluster.
A full treatment requires a realistic treatment of the cluster potential, the
distribution of turbulent velocities and gas densities. Accreting gas does not
travel at the global virial velocity of the system due to the
velocity-sizescale relation inherent in turbulent gas and due to the lower
velocity dispersion of small-N clusters in which much of the accretion occurs.
Stars located in the gas-rich centres of such systems initially accrete from
low relative velocity gas attaining larger masses before needing to accrete the
higher velocity gas. Stars not in the centres of such potentials, or that enter
the cluster later when the velocity dispersion is higher, do not accrete
significantly and thus retain their low-masses. In competitive accretion, most
stars do not continue to accrete significantly such that their masses are set
from the fragmentation process. It is the few stars which continue to accrete
that become higher-mass stars. Competitive accretion is therefore likely to be
responsible for the formation of higher-mass stars and can explain the mass
distribution, mass segregation and binary frequency of these stars. Global
kinematics of competitive accretion models include large-scale mass infall,
with mean inflow velocities of order 0.5 km/s at scales of 0.5 pc, but infall
signatures are likely to be confused by the large tangential velocities and the
velocity dispersion present.",2006-04-28T16:41:38Z
"Dynamical Formation of the Dark Molecular Hydrogen Clouds around Diffuse
  HII Regions","We examine the triggering process of molecular cloud formation around diffuse
HII regions. We calculate the time evolution of the shell as well as of the HII
region in a two-phase neutral medium, solving the UV and FUV radiative
transfer, the thermal and chemical processes in the time-dependent
hydrodynamics code. In the cold neutral medium, the ambient gas is swept up in
the cold (T \sim 30-40K) and dense (n \sim 10^3 cm^-3) shell around the HII
region. In the shell, H_2 molecules are formed from the swept-up HI gas, but CO
molecules are hardly formed. The reformation of H_2 molecules is more efficient
with a higher-mass central star. The physical and chemical properties of gas in
the shell are just intermediate between those of the neutral medium and
molecular clouds observed by the CO emission. The dense shell with cold HI/H_2
gas easily becomes gravitationally unstable, and breaks up into small clouds.
The cooling layer just behind the shock front also suffers from thermal
instability, and will fragment into cloudlets with some translational motions.
We suggest that the predicted cold ``dark'' HI/H_2 gas should be detected as
the HI self-absorption (HISA) feature. We have sought such features in recent
observational data, and found shell-like HISA features around the giant HII
regions, W4 and W5. The shell-like HISA feature shows good spatial correlation
with dust emission, but poor correlation with CO emission. Our quantitative
analysis shows that the HISA cloud can be as cold as T \sim a few x 10K.

"Evidences on secular dynamical evolution of detached active binary
  orbits and contact binary formation","Evidence of secular dynamical evolution for detached active binary orbits are
presented. First order decreasing rates of orbital angular momentum (OAM),
systemic mass ($M=M_{1}+M_{2}$) and orbital period of detached active binaries
have been determined as $\dot J/J = -3.48 \times 10^{-10}$yr$^{-1}$, $\dot M/M
= -1.30 \times 10^{-10}$yr$^{-1}$ and $\dot P/P = -3.96\times
10^{-10}$yr$^{-1}$ from the kinematical ages of 62 field detached systems. The
ratio of $d \log J/ d \log M = 2.68$ implies that either there are mechanisms
which amplify AM loss $\delta=2.68$ times with respect to isotropic AM loss of
hypothetical isotropic winds or there exist external causes contributing AM
loss in order to produce this mean rate of decrease for orbital periods.
Various decreasing rates of OAM ($d \log J / dt$) and systemic mass ($d \log M/
dt$) determine various speeds of dynamical evolutions towards a contact
configuration. According to average dynamical evolution with $\delta = 2.68$,
the fraction of 11, 23 and 39 per cent of current detached sample is expected
to be contact system within 2, 4 and 6 Gyr respectively.",2006-07-04T16:34:40Z
The H.E.S.S. View of the Central 200 Parsecs,"The inner few hundred parsecs of our galaxy provide a laboratory for the
study of the production and propagation of energetic particles.
Very-high-energy gamma-rays provide an effective probe of these processes and,
especially when combined with data from other wave-bands, gamma-rays
observations are a powerful diagnostic tool. Within this central region, data
from the H.E.S.S. instrument have revealed three discrete sources of
very-high-energy gamma-rays and diffuse emission correlated with the
distribution of molecular material. Here I provide an overview of these recent
results from H.E.S.S.",2006-07-15T14:42:52Z
Helical Magnetorotational Instability in Magnetized Taylor-Couette Flow,"Hollerbach and Rudiger have reported a new type of magnetorotational
instability (MRI) in magnetized Taylor-Couette flow in the presence of combined
axial and azimuthal magnetic fields. The salient advantage of this ""helical''
MRI (HMRI) is that marginal instability occurs at arbitrarily low magnetic
Reynolds and Lundquist numbers, suggesting that HMRI might be easier to realize
than standard MRI (axial field only). We confirm their results, calculate HMRI
growth rates, and show that in the resistive limit, HMRI is a weakly
destabilized inertial oscillation propagating in a unique direction along the
axis. But we report other features of HMRI that make it less attractive for
experiments and for resistive astrophysical disks. Growth rates are small and
require large axial currents. More fundamentally, instability of highly
resistive flow is peculiar to infinitely long or periodic cylinders: finite
cylinders with insulating endcaps are shown to be stable in this limit. Also,
keplerian rotation profiles are stable in the resistive limit regardless of
axial boundary conditions. Nevertheless, the addition of toroidal field lowers
thresholds for instability even in finite cylinders.",2006-06-06T18:34:36Z
"Testing the inverse-Compton catastrophe scenario in the intra-day
  variable blazar S5 0716+71: II. A search for intra-day variability at
  millimetre wavelengths with the IRAM 30 m telescope","We report on a densely time sampled polarimetric flux density monitoring of
the BL Lac object S5 0716+71 at 86 GHz and 229 GHz with the IRAM 30 m telescope
within a coordinated broad spectral band campaign, centred around an INTEGRAL
observation during November 10 to 16, 2003. Our aim was to search for
signatures of inverse-Compton ""catastrophes"". At 86 GHz, making use of a new
calibration strategy, we reach a relative rms accuracy of the flux density
measurements of 1.2%. At this frequency, S5 0716+71 showed no intra-day
variability, but showed remarkable inter-day variability with a flux density
increase of 34% during the first four observing days, which can not be
explained by source extrinsic causes. The 86 GHz linear polarization fraction
of S5 0716+71 was unusually large 15.0+-1.8%. Inter-day variability in linear
polarization at 86 GHz, with significance level >~95%; sigma_P/<P>=15% and
sigma_chi=6 deg., was also observed. From the emission variations at the
synchrotron turnover frequency (~86 GHz) we compute an apparent brightness
temperature T_B,app>1.4x10^14K at a redshift of 0.3, which exceeds by two
orders of magnitude the inverse-Compton limit. A relativistic correction for
T_B,app with a Doppler factor delta > 7.8 brings the observed brightness
temperature down to the inverse Compton limit. A more accurate lower limit of
delta > 14.0, is obtained from the comparison of the 86 GHz synchrotron flux
density and the upper limits for the synchrotron self-Compton flux density
obtained from the INTEGRAL observations. The relativistic beaming of the
emission by this high Doppler factor explains the non-detection of
""catastrophic"" inverse-Compton avalanches by INTEGRAL.",2006-06-02T12:35:57Z
"Automated derivation of stellar atmospheric parameters and chemical
  abundances: the MATISSE algorithm","We present an automated procedure for the derivation of atmospheric
parameters (Teff, log g, [M/H]) and individual chemical abundances from stellar
spectra. The MATrix Inversion for Spectral SythEsis (MATISSE) algorithm
determines a basis, B_\theta(\lambda), allowing to derive a particular stellar
parameter \theta by projection of an observed spectrum. The B_\theta(\lambda)
function is determined from an optimal linear combination of theoretical
spectra and it relates, in a quantitative way, the variations in the spectrum
flux with variations in \theta. An application of this method to the GAIA/RVS
spectral range is described, together with its performances for different types
of stars of various metallicities. Blind tests with synthetic spectra of
randomly selected parameters and observed input spectra are also presented. The
method gives rapid, accurate and stable results and it can be efficiently
applied to the study of stellar populations through the analysis of large
spectral data sets, including moderate to low signal to noise spectra.",2006-04-18T16:26:12Z
Proto-Clusters with Evolved Populations around Radio Galaxies at z~2.5,"We report a discovery of proto-cluster candidates around high redshift radio
galaxies at z~2.5 on the basis of clear statistical excess of colour-selected
galaxies around them seen in the deep near-infrared imaging data obtained with
CISCO on Subaru Telescope. We have observed six targets, all at similar
redshifts at z~2.5, and our data reach to J=23.5, H=22.6 and K=21.8 (5 sigma)
and cover a 1.6' x 1.6' field centered on each radio galaxy. We apply colour
cuts in JHKs in order to exclusively search for galaxies located at high
redshifts, z>2. Over the magnitude range of 19.5<K<21.5 we see a significant
excess of red galaxies with J-K>2.3 by a factor of two around the combined
radio galaxies fields compared to those found in the general field of GOODS
South. The excess of galaxies around the radio galaxies fields becomes more
than factor of three around 19.5<K<20.5 when the two-colours cuts are applied
with JHKs. Such overdensity of the colour-selected galaxies suggest that those
fields tend to host high density regions at high redshifts, although there
seems to be the variety of the density of the colour-selected galaxies in each
field. In particular, two radio galaxies fields out of the six observed fields
show very strong density excess and these are likely to be proto-clusters
associated to the radio galaxies which would evolve into rich clusters of
galaxies dominated by old passively evolving galaxies.",2006-06-16T14:01:21Z
Propeller driven spectral state transition in LMXB 4U 1608-52,"Spectral state transitions in neutron star LMXB systems have been widely
observed yet not well understood. Here we report an abrupt spectral change in
4U 1608-52, a typical atoll source, during its decay phase of the 2004
outburst. The source is found to undergo sudden changes in its spectral
hardness and other properties. The transition occurred when its luminosity is
between (3.3-5.3) E36 ergs/s, assuming a distance of 3.6 kpc. Interpreting this
event in terms of the propeller effect, we infer the neutron star surface
magnetic field as (1.4-1.8) E8 Gauss. We also briefly discuss similarities and
differences between the spectral states of neutron star and black hole binary
systems.",2006-07-07T03:19:02Z
"Evidence for Shocked Molecular Gas in the Galactic SNR CTB 109
  (G109.1-1.0)","We report the detection of molecular clouds around the X-ray bright interior
feature in the Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) CTB 109 (G109.1-1.0). This
feature, called the Lobe, has been previously suggested to be the result of an
interaction of the SNR shock wave with a molecular cloud complex. We present
new high resolution X-ray data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and new high
resolution CO data from the Five College Radio Observatory which show the
interaction region with the cloud complex in greater detail. The CO data reveal
three clouds around the Lobe in the velocity interval -57 < v < -52 km s^-1.
The velocity profiles of 12CO at various parts of the east cloud are well fit
with a Gaussian; however, at the position where the CO cloud and the Lobe
overlap, the velocity profile has an additional component towards higher
negative velocities. The molecular hydrogen density in this part of the cloud
is relatively high (N_H2 = 1.9 x 10^20 cm^-2), whereas the foreground
absorption in X-rays (N_H = 4.5 x 10^21 cm^-2), obtained from Chandra data, is
lower than in other parts of the cloud and in the north and south cloud. These
results indicate that this cloud has been hit by the SNR blast wave on the
western side, forming the bright X-ray Lobe.",2006-04-07T14:22:22Z
"The Remarkable Mid-Infrared Jet of Massive Young Stellar Object
  G35.20-0.74","The young massive stellar object G35.20-0.74 was observed in the mid-infrared
using T-ReCS on Gemini South. Previous observations have shown that the near
infrared emission has a fan-like morphology that is consistent with emission
from the northern lobe of a bipolar radio jet known to be associated with this
source. Mid-infrared observations presented in this paper show a monopolar
jet-like morphology as well, and it is argued that the mid-infrared emission
observed is dominated by thermal continuum emission from dust. The mid-infrared
emission nearest the central stellar source is believed to be directly heated
dust on the walls of the outflow cavity. The hydroxyl, water, and methanol
masers associated with G35.20-0.74 are spatially located along these
mid-infrared cavity walls. Narrow jet or outflow cavities such as this may also
be the locations of the linear distribution of methanol masers that are found
associated with massive young stellar objects. The fact that G35.20-0.74 has
mid-infrared emission that is dominated by the outflow, rather than disk
emission, is a caution to those that consider mid-infrared emission from young
stellar objects as only coming from circumstellar disks.",2006-03-16T16:00:14Z
"Low-mass star formation in R Coronae Australis: Observations of organic
  molecules with the APEX telescope","This paper presents new APEX submillimetre molecular line observations of
three low-mass protostars, IRS7A, IRS7B, and IRAS32, in the R Coronae Australis
molecular cloud complex. The molecular excitation analysis is performed using a
statistical equilibrium radiative transfer code. The derived beam averaged
fractional abundances vary by less than a factor of two among the three
sources, except those of H2CO and CH3OH, which show differences of about an
order of magnitude. The molecular abundances are similar to those typically
found in other star-forming regions in the Galaxy, such as the $\rho$~Oph and
Perseus molecular clouds. There is a marked difference in the kinetic
temperatures derived for the protobinary source IRS7 from H2CO (40-60 K) and
CH3OH (20 K), possibly indicating a difference in origin of the emission from
these two molecules.",2006-05-23T12:39:20Z
"Comparing Pattern Recognition Feature Sets for Sorting Triples in the
  FIRST Database","Pattern recognition techniques have been used with increasing success for
coping with the tremendous amounts of data being generated by automated
surveys. Usually this process involves construction of training sets, the
typical examples of data with known classifications. Given a feature set, along
with the training set, statistical methods can be employed to generate a
classifier. The classifier is then applied to process the remaining data.
Feature set selection, however, is still an issue. This report presents
techniques developed for accommodating data for which a substantive portion of
the training set cannot be classified unambiguously, a typical case for low
resolution data. Significance tests on the sort-ordered, sample-size normalized
vote distribution of an ensemble of decision trees is introduced as a method of
evaluating relative quality of feature sets. The technique is applied to
comparing feature sets for sorting a particular radio galaxy morphology,
bent-doubles, from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters
(FIRST) database. Also examined are alternative functional forms for feature
sets. Associated standard deviations provide the means to evaluate the effect
of the number of folds, the number of classifiers per fold, and the sample size
on the resulting classifications.",2006-05-03T19:46:03Z
Heating and cooling of the intergalactic medium by resonance photons,"During the epoch of reionization a large number of photons were produced with
frequencies below the hydrogen Lyman limit. After redshifting into the closest
resonance, these photons underwent multiple scatterings with atoms. We examine
the effect of these scatterings on the temperature of the neutral intergalactic
medium (IGM). Continuum photons, emitted between the Ly_alpha and Ly_gamma
frequencies, heat the gas after being redshifted into the H Ly_alpha or D
Ly_beta resonance. By contrast, photons emitted between the Ly_gamma and
Ly-limit frequencies, produce effective cooling of the gas. Prior to
reionization, the equilibrium temperature of ~100 K for hydrogen and helium
atoms is set by these two competing processes. At the same time, Ly_beta
resonance photons thermally decouple deuterium from other species, raising its
temperature as high as 10^4 K. Our results have important consequences for the
cosmic 21-cm background and the entropy floor of the early IGM which can affect
star formation and reionization.",2006-04-22T18:37:17Z
"A Combined EIS-NVSS Survey Of Radio Sources II: Infrared imaging and the
  K-z relation","The Combined EIS-NVSS Survey Of Radio Sources (CENSORS) is a 1.4 GHz radio
survey selected from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) and complete to a
flux-density of 7.2mJy. It targets the ESO Imaging Survey (EIS) Patch D, which
is a 3 by 2 square degree field centred on 09 51 36.0 -21 00 00 (J2000). This
paper presents K-band imaging of 142 of the 150 CENSORS sources. The primary
motivation for beginning infrared imaging of the sample was to identify the
host galaxies of the ~30% of sources for which the EIS I-band imaging failed to
produce a likely candidate. In addition, K-band magnitudes allow photometric
redshift estimation and I - K colours aid the identification of host galaxies
(which are typically old, red ellipticals). Of the sources observed in the I
and K-bands, four remain undetected, possibly indicating high redshifts for the
host galaxies, and eight involve complicated radio structures, or several
candidate host galaxies, which have yet to be resolved. Thus, the host galaxy
identifications are brought to 92% completeness.
  In conjunction with spectroscopic observations, the K-band magnitudes have
been aperture corrected and used to establish a K-z relation for the CENSORS
radio galaxies. This relation is of interest because of its variation, at z >
1, between radio surveys of different flux-density limit. Establishing this
relation for CENSORS may shed light on the origin of this variation and will
allow an appropriate K-z redshift estimator for any CENSORS source which
remains without a spectroscopic redshift. It is shown that whilst the K-z
relation for CENSORS is fainter than that of 3CRR at all redshifts, it agrees
well with that of 7C over all redshifts studied.",2006-03-24T00:29:47Z
"New nonadiabatic pulsation computations on full PG1159 evolutionary
  models: the theoretical GW Vir instability strip revisited","We reexamine the theoretical instability domain of pulsating PG1159 stars (GW
Vir variables). We performed an extensive g-mode stability analysis on PG1159
evolutionary models with stellar masses ranging from 0.530 to 0.741 Mo for
which the complete evolutionary stages of their progenitors from the ZAMS,
through the thermally pulsing AGB and born-again phases to the domain of the
PG1159 stars have been considered. We found that pulsations in PG1159 stars are
excited by the kappa-mechanism due to partial ionization of carbon and oxygen,
and that no composition gradients are needed between the surface layers and the
driving region, much in agreement with previous studies. We show, for the first
time, the existence of a red edge of the instability strip at high
luminosities. We found that all of the GW Vir stars lay within our theoretical
instability strip. Our results suggest a qualitative good agreement between the
observed and the predicted ranges of unstable periods of individual stars.
Finally, we found that generally the seismic masses (derived from the period
spacing) of GW Vir stars are somewhat different from the masses suggested by
evolutionary tracks coupled with spectroscopy. Improvements in the evolution
during the thermally pulsing AGB phase and/or during the core helium burning
stage and early AGB could help to alleviate the persisting discrepancies.",2006-07-03T19:05:28Z
Protoplanet Dynamics in a Shear-Dominated Disk,"The velocity dispersion, or eccentricity distribution, of protoplanets
interacting with planetesimals is set by a balance between dynamical friction
and viscous stirring. We calculate analytically the eccentricity distribution
function of protoplanets embedded in a cold, shear-dominated planetesimal
swarm. We find a distinctly non-Rayleigh distribution with a simple analytical
form. The peak of the distribution lies much lower than the root-mean-squared
value, indicating that while most of the bodies have similarly small
eccentricities, a small subset of the population contains most of the thermal
energy. We also measure the shear-dominated eccentricity distribution using
numerical simulations. The numerical code treats each protoplanet explicitly
and adds an additional force term to each body to represent the dynamical
friction of the planetesimals. Without fitting any parameters, the eccentricity
distribution of protoplanets in the N-body simulation agrees with the
analytical results. This distribution function provides a useful tool for
testing hybrid numerical simulations of late-stage planet formation.",2006-04-04T20:12:43Z
"The host galaxy/AGN connection in nearby early-type galaxies. A new view
  of the origin of the radio-quiet/radio-loud dichotomy?","[ABRIDGED] This is the third in a series of three papers exploring the
connection between the multiwavelength properties of AGN in nearby early-type
galaxies and the characteristics of their hosts. We selected 116 AGN candidates
requiring a radio flux of 1 mJy. We classified the objects with HST images into
``core'' and ``power-law'' galaxies, on the basis of the nuclear slope of their
brightness profiles. We used HST and Chandra data to isolate their nuclear
emission to study the multiwavelength behaviour of their nuclei. The properties
of the nuclei hosted by the 29 core galaxies were presented in Paper II. Core
galaxies invariably host a radio-loud nucleus, with a median radio-loudness of
Log R = 3.6 and an X-ray based radio loudness parameter of Log R,X = -1.3. Here
we discuss the properties of the nuclei of the 22 ``power-law'' galaxies. They
show a substantial excess of optical and X-ray emission with respect to core
galaxies at the same level of radio luminosity. Conversely, their
radio-loudness parameters, Log R ~ 1.6 and Log R,X ~ -3.3, are similar to those
measured in Seyfert galaxies. Thus the radio-loudness of AGN hosted by
early-type galaxies appears to be univocally related to the host's brightness
profile: radio-loud AGN are only hosted by core galaxies, while radio-quiet AGN
are found only in power-law galaxies. The brightness profile is determined by
the galaxy's evolution, through its merger history; our results suggest that
the same process sets the AGN flavour.",2006-03-14T13:17:32Z
Collisional Particle Disks,"We present a new, simple, fast algorithm to numerically evolve disks of
inelastically colliding particles surrounding a central star. Our algorithm
adds negligible computational cost to the fastest existing collisionless N-body
codes, and can be used to simulate, for the first time, the interaction of
planets with disks over many viscous times. Though the algorithm is implemented
in two dimensions-i.e., the motions of bodies need only be tracked in a
plane-it captures the behavior of fully three-dimensional disks in which
collisions maintain inclinations that are comparable to random eccentricities.
We subject the algorithm to a battery of tests for the case of an isolated,
narrow, circular ring. Numerical simulations agree with analytic theory with
regards to how particles' random velocities equilibrate; how the ring viscously
spreads; and how energy dissipation, angular momentum transport, and material
transport are connected. We derive and measure the critical value of the
coefficient of restitution above which viscous stirring dominates inelastic
damping and the particles' velocity dispersion runs away.",2006-07-11T21:51:17Z
"XMM-Newton observation of the Be/neutron star system RX J0146.9+6121: a
  soft X-ray excess in a low luminosity accreting pulsar","We report on the XMM-Newton observation of the Be/neutron star X-ray binary
system RX J0146.9+6121, a long period (~ 23 m) pulsar in the NGC 663 open
cluster. The X-ray luminosity decreased by a factor two compared to the last
observation carried out in 1998, reaching a level of ~ 10^34 erg/s, the lowest
ever observed in this source. The spectral analysis reveals the presence of a
significant excess at low energies over the main power-law spectral component.
The soft excess can be described by a black-body spectrum with a temperature of
about 1 keV and an emitting region with a radius of ~ 140 m. Although the
current data do not permit to ascertain whether the soft excess is pulsed or
not, its properties are consistent with emission from the neutron star polar
cap. This is the third detection of a soft excess in a low luminosity (~ 10^34
erg/s) pulsar, the other being X Per and 3A 0535+262, suggesting that such
spectral component, observed up to date in higher luminosity systems, is a
rather common feature of accreting X-ray pulsars. The results on these three
sources indicate that, in low luminosity systems, the soft excess tends to have
a higher temperature and a smaller surface area than in the high luminosity
ones.",2006-04-10T08:25:18Z
Distribution of extinction and star formation in NGC1569,"We investigate the distribution of the intrinsic extinction in NGC1569 using
an extinction map derived from the H_alpha/H_beta emission line ratio. We
compare the extinction distribution to that of the dust emission traced by
SPITZER IRAC(8microns) and MIPS (24microns) maps. The intrinsic extinction
shows spatial variations, from zones with negligible extinction to zones with
values up to A(V)=0.8mag. We find an extinction shell and establish a relation
between this shell and the interstellar expanding structure produced by the
stellar winds comig from the Super Star Cluster (SSCs) A and B in the center of
the galaxy. We suggest that the extinction shell has been produced by the
accumulation of dust at the border of the shell. Although we find a good
spatial correlation between the Balmer extinction and infrared emission, there
is a spatial displacement between the 8microns and 24microns maxima and the
maximum in Balmer extinction which needs further investigation.",2006-03-23T16:52:09Z
"Optical polarimetry and infrared photometry of two AM Her binaries: 1RXS
  J161008.0+035222 and 1RXS J231603.9-052713","We present the first optical circular and linear polarization measurements of
two polar candidates from ROSAT: 1RXS J161008.0+035222 and 1RXS
J231603.9-052713. We also present H band near-infrared photometry of the last
object. The presence of strong circular polarization confirms them as AM Her
systems. 1RXS J231603.9-052713 was observed in two different brightness states.
The orbital phase dependence of the flux and polarization of 1RXS
J161008.0+035222 is reasonably fitted with a simple model in which the binary
is observed at a small inclination and the magnetic field axis is almost
parallel to the white-dwarf rotation axis resulting in the accretion column
axis being seen from top during the whole orbital revolution. The magnetic
field is probably in the 10 to 20 MG range. The circular polarization of 1RXS
J231603.9-052713 is complex and highly variable. The light-curves of that
object have been fitted using a model which includes the white-dwarf, a heated
secondary and a point-like accretion region. The secondary emission contributes
significantly even in optical wavelengths. This model also reproduces the main
features of the optical polarization of 1RXS J231603.9-052713. We estimate the
main parameters of the binary, of the accretion region and the distance to the
system. However, a more precise interpretation of this system should take in
account an extended and inhomogeneous accreting region as well as non-radial
accretion.",2006-04-13T16:23:49Z
"Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect from the cross correlation of WMAP3 year
  and the NRAO VLA sky survey data: New results and constraints on dark energy","We cross-correlate the new 3 year Wilkinson Microwave Anistropy Probe (WMAP)
cosmic microwave background (CMB) data with the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS)
radio galaxy data, and find further evidence of late integrated Sachs-Wolfe
(ISW) effect taking place at late times in cosmic history. Our detection makes
use of a novel statistical method \cite{Baldi et al. 2006a, Baldi et al. 2006b}
based on a new construction of spherical wavelets, called needlets. The null
hypothesis (no ISW) is excluded at more than 99.7% confidence. When we compare
the measured cross-correlation with the theoretical predictions of standard,
flat cosmological models with a generalized dark energy component parameterized
by its density, $\omde$, equation of state $w$ and speed of sound $\cs2$, we
find $0.3\leq\omde\leq0.8$ at 95% c.l., independently of $\cs2$ and $w$. If
dark energy is assumed to be a cosmological constant ($w=-1$), the bound on
density shrinks to $0.41\leq\omde\leq 0.79$. Models without dark energy are
excluded at more than $4\sigma$. The bounds on $w$ depend rather strongly on
the assumed value of $\cs2$. We find that models with more negative equation of
state (such as phantom models) are a worse fit to the data in the case $\cs2=1$
than in the case $\cs2=0$.",2006-06-20T09:59:53Z
"The Starburst-Interstellar Medium Interaction in NGC 1569 II.
  Small-Scale Examination of Nebular Emission, H II Region Size Distribution,
  and H II Region Luminosity Function","(abridged) NGC 1569 is an ideal test environment to understand the impact of
""feedback"" from massive stars on the surrounding ISM. We present HST WFPC2
narrowband imagery of NGC 1569 in an attempt to understand the underlying
ionizing emission mechanisms on a 3 pc scale and to generate a H II region size
distribution and luminosity function. We use [O III]/Hbeta and [S II]/Halpha
ratio maps to find that non-photoionizing mechanisms (e.g. shocks) are
responsible for 10%+/-3% of the Halpha emission, 2.3-3.3 times larger than
results from similar galaxies. Our results for NGC 1569 indicate that these
non-photoionized areas do not lie in low surface brightness regions
exclusively. To explain this large percentage of non-photoionized emission, we
suggest that NGC 1569 is, indeed, in a post-starburst phase as previous authors
have claimed. We also derived slopes for the H II region luminosity function
(-1.00+/-0.08) and size distribution (-3.02+/-0.27). The luminosity slope,
though shallow, is similar to previous work on this galaxy and other irregular
galaxies. The size distribution slope is shallower than previous slopes found
for irregular galaxies, but our slope value fits into their confidence
intervals and vice versa.",2006-05-23T17:26:53Z
"Mass segregation in rich LMC clusters from modelling of deep HST
  colour-magnitude diagrams","We used the deep colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of five rich LMC clusters
(NGC1805, 1818, 1831, 1868, and Hodge14) observed with HST/WFPC2 to derive
their present day mass function (PDMF) and its variation with position within
the cluster. The PDMF was parameterized as a power law in the available
main-sequence mass range of each cluster, typically 0.9 <~ m/M_sun <~ 2.5; its
slope was determined at different positions spanning from the very centre out
to several core radii. The CMDs in the central regions of the clusters were
carefully studied earlier, resulting in accurate age, metallicity, distance
modulus, and reddening values. The slope alpha (where Salpeter is 2.35) was
determined in annuli by following two distinct methods: 1) a power law fit to
the PDMF obtained from the systemic luminosity function (LF); 2) a statistical
comparison between observed and model CMDs. In all clusters, significant mass
segregation is found from the positional dependence of the PDMF slope: alpha <~
1.8 for R <= 1.0 R_core and alpha ~ Salpeter inside R=2~3 R_core (except for
Hodge 14, where alpha ~ Salpeter for R ~ 4 R_core). The results are robust in
the sense that they hold true for both methods used. The CMD method reveals
that unresolved binaries flatten the PDMF obtained form the systemic LF, but
this effect is smaller than the uncertainties in the alpha determination. For
each cluster we estimated dynamical ages inside the core and for the entire
system. In both cases we found a trend in the sense that older clusters have
flatter PDMF, consistent with a dynamical mass segregation and stellar
evaporation.",2006-04-28T19:35:45Z
"The Survey for Ionization in Neutral Gas Galaxies: I. Description and
  Initial Results","We introduce the Survey for Ionization in Neutral Gas Galaxies (SINGG), a
census of star formation in HI-selected galaxies. The survey consists of
H-alpha and R-band imaging of a sample of 468 galaxies selected from the HI
Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS). The sample spans three decades in HI mass and
is free of many of the biases that affect other star forming galaxy samples. We
present the criteria for sample selection, list the entire sample, discuss our
observational techniques, and describe the data reduction and calibration
methods. This paper focuses on 93 SINGG targets whose observations have been
fully reduced and analyzed to date. The majority of these show a single
Emission Line Galaxy (ELG). We see multiple ELGs in 13 fields, with up to four
ELGs in a single field. All of the targets in this sample are detected in
H-alpha indicating that dormant (non-star forming) galaxies with M(HI) > ~3e7
M_sun are very rare. A database of the measured global properties of the ELGs
is presented. The ELG sample spans four orders of magnitude in luminosity
(H-alpha and R-band), and H-alpha surface brightness, nearly three orders of
magnitude in R surface brightness and nearly two orders of magnitude in H-alpha
equivalent width (EW). The surface brightness distribution of our sample is
broader than that of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopic sample, the
(EW) distribution is broader than prism-selected samples, and the morphologies
found include all common types of star forming galaxies (e.g. irregular,
spiral, blue compact dwarf, starbursts, merging and colliding systems, and even
residual star formation in S0 and Sa spirals). (abridged)",2006-04-20T20:13:46Z
"The GOODS-MUSIC sample: a multicolour catalog of near-IR selected
  galaxies in the GOODS-South field","We present a high quality multiwavelength (from 0.3 to 8.0 micron) catalog of
the large and deep area in the GOODS Southern Field covered by the deep near-IR
observations obtained with the ESO VLT. The catalog is entirely based on public
data: in our analysis, we have included the F435W, F606W, F775W and F850LP ACS
images, the JHKs VLT data, the Spitzer data provided by IRAC instrument (3.6,
4.5, 5.8 and 8.0 micron), and publicly available U-band data from the 2.2ESO
and VLT-VIMOS. We describe in detail the procedures adopted to obtain this
multiwavelength catalog. In particular, we developed a specific software for
the accurate ""PSF-matching"" of space and ground-based images of different
resolution and depth (ConvPhot), of which we analyse performances and
limitations. We have included both z-selected, as well as Ks-selected objects,
yielding a unique, self-consistent catalog. The largest fraction of the sample
is 90% complete at z~26 or Ks~23.8 (AB scale). Finally, we cross-correlated our
data with all the spectroscopic catalogs available to date, assigning a
spectroscopic redshift to more than 1000 sources. The final catalog is made up
of 14847 objects, at least 72 of which are known stars, 68 are AGNs, and 928
galaxies with spectroscopic redshift (668 galaxies with reliable redshift
determination). We applied our photometric redshift code to this data set, and
the comparison with the spectroscopic sample shows that the quality of the
resulting photometric redshifts is excellent, with an average scatter of only
0.06. The full catalog, which we named GOODS-MUSIC (MUltiwavelength Southern
Infrared Catalog), including the spectroscopic information, is made publicly
available, together with the software specifically designed to this end.",2006-03-03T18:23:36Z
"The Role of Evolutionary Age and Metallicity in the Formation of
  Classical Be Circumstellar Disks I. New Candidate Be Stars in the LMC, SMC,
  and Milky Way","We present B, V, R, and H alpha photometry of 8 clusters in the Small
Magellanic Cloud, 5 in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and 3 Galactic clusters, and
use 2 color diagrams (2-CDs) to identify candidate Be star populations in these
clusters. We find evidence that the Be phenomenon is enhanced in low
metallicity environments, based on the observed fractional early-type candidate
Be star content of clusters of age 10-25 Myr. Numerous candidate Be stars of
spectral types B0 to B5 were identified in clusters of age 5-8 Myr, challenging
the suggestion of Fabregat & Torrejon (2000) that classical Be stars should
only be found in clusters at least 10 Myr old. These results suggest that a
significant number of B-type stars must emerge onto the zero-age-main-sequence
as rapid rotators. We also detect an enhancement in the fractional content of
early-type candidate Be stars in clusters of age 10-25 Myr, suggesting that the
Be phenomenon does become more prevalent with evolutionary age. We briefly
discuss the mechanisms which might contribute to such an evolutionary effect. A
discussion of the limitations of utilizing the 2-CD technique to investigate
the role evolutionary age and/or metallicity play in the development of the Be
phenomenon is offered, and we provide evidence that other B-type objects of
very different nature, such as candidate Herbig Ae/Be stars may contaminate the
claimed detections of ``Be stars'' via 2-CDs.",2006-06-21T14:50:00Z
"The Distance to the Galactic Center Derived From Infrared Photometry of
  Bulge Red Clump Stars","On the basis of the near infrared observations of bulge red clump stars near
the Galactic center, we have determined the galactocentric distance to be R_0 =
7.52 +- 0.10 (stat) +- 0.35 (sys) kpc. We observed the red clump stars at |l| <
1.0 deg and 0.7 deg < |b| < 1.0 deg with the IRSF 1.4 m telescope and the
SIRIUS camera in the H and Ks bands. After extinction and population
corrections, we obtained (m - M)_0 = 14.38 +- 0.03 (stat) +- 0.10 (sys). The
statistical error is dominated by the uncertainty of the intrinsic local red
clump stars' luminosity. The systematic error is estimated to be +- 0.10
including uncertainties in extinction and population correction, zero-point of
photometry, and the fitting of the luminosity function of the red clump stars.
Our result, R_0 = 7.52 kpc, is in excellent agreement with the distance
determined geometrically with the star orbiting the massive black hole in the
Galactic center. The recent result based on the spatial distribution of
globular clusters is also consistent with our result. In addition, our study
exhibits that the distance determination to the Galactic center with the red
clump stars, even if the error of the population correction is taken into
account, can achieve an uncertainty of about 5%, which is almost the same level
as that in recent geometrical determinations.",2006-07-18T10:09:12Z
"Chandra monitoring observations of the ultraluminous X-ray source NGC
  5204 X-1","We report the results of a 2-month campaign conducted with the Chandra X-ray
observatory to monitor the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) NGC 5204 X-1. This
was composed of a 50-ks observation, followed by ten 5-ks follow-ups spaced
initially at ~ 3, then at ~ 10 day intervals. The ULX flux is seen to vary by
factors ~ 5 on timescales of a few days, but no strong variability is seen on
timescales shorter than an hour. There is no evidence for a periodic signal in
the X-ray data. An examination of the X-ray colour variations over the period
of the campaign shows the ULX emission consistently becomes spectrally harder
as its flux increases. The X-ray spectrum from the 50-ks observation can be
fitted by a number of disparate spectral models, all of which describe a smooth
continuum with, unusually for a ULX, a broad emission feature evident at 0.96
keV. The spectral variations, both within the 50-ks observation and over the
course of the whole campaign, can then be explained solely by variations in the
continuum component. In the context of an optically-thick corona model (as
found in other recent results for ULXs) the spectral variations can be
explained by the heating of the corona as the luminosity of the ULX increases,
consistent with the behaviour of at least one Galactic black hole system in the
strongly-Comptonised very high state. We find no new evidence supporting the
presence of an intermediate-mass black hole in this ULX.",2006-07-17T13:35:22Z
Numerical simulations of coronal magnetic field loop evolution,"We present the results of the numerical simulations of the interaction
between a magnetized star and an imperfectly conducting accretion disk. To
analyze the ''star-disk'' interaction we numerically investigate the MHD
equations used Godunov-type high resolution numerical method. It was found that
the ''star-disk'' interaction occurs with quasi-periodic reconnection of the
magnetic field coronal loops and plasmoid ejections. In the case of the perfect
disk conductivity the evolution of the coronal magnetic field leads to the
periodic outflow of angular momentum from the disk. In the case of an
imperfectly conducting disk the configuration of the magnetic field is formed
such that the disk angular momentum carried by magnetic field gets balanced by
angular momentum carried by matter.",2006-03-31T17:20:16Z
"Dynamical Formation of Close Binaries in Globular Clusters II:
  Cataclysmic Variables","We answer the long-standing question of which production mechanism is
responsible for the cataclysmic variables (CVs) in globular clusters. Arguments
have been given that range from mostly primordial presence to a significant
contribution of later dynamical formation in close stellar encounters. We
conclude, based on a thorough analysis of a homogeneous {\it Chandra} data set,
that the majority of CVs in globulars has a dynamical origin.",2006-05-02T00:40:29Z
"Simulations of Mixed Morphology Supernova Remnants With Anisotropic
  Thermal Conduction","We explore the role of anisotropic thermal conduction on the evolution of
supernova remnants through interstellar media with a range of densities via
numerical simulations. We find that a remnant expanding in a dense environment
can produce centre-bright hard x-ray emission within 20 kyr, and centre-bright
soft x-ray emission within 60 kyr of the supernova event. In a more tenuous
environment, the appearance of a centre-bright structure in hard x-rays is
delayed until about 60 kyr. The soft x-ray emission from such a remnant may not
become centre bright during its observable lifetime. This can explain the
observations that show that mixed-morphology supernova remnants preferentially
occur close to denser, molecular environments. Remnants expanding into denser
environments tend to be smaller, making it easier for thermal conduction to
make larger changes in the temperatures of their hot gas bubbles. We show that
the lower temperatures make it very favorable to use high-stage ions as
diagnostics of the hot gas bubbles in SNRs. In particular, the distribution of
O VIII transitions from shell-bright at early epochs to centre-bright at later
epochs in the evolution of an SNR expanding in a dense ISM when the physics of
thermal conduction is included.",2006-04-21T19:33:09Z
"Deep Extragalactic Surveys around the Ecliptic Poles with AKARI
  (ASTRO-F)","AKARI (formerly ASTRO-F) is an infrared space telescope designed for an
all-sky survey at 10-180 (mu)m, and deep pointed surveys of selected areas at
2-180 (mu)m. The deep pointed surveys with AKARI will significantly advance our
understanding of galaxy evolution, the structure formation of the Universe, the
nature of the buried AGNs, and the cosmic infrared background. Here we describe
the important characteristics of the AKARI mission: the orbit, and the attitude
control system, and investigate the optimum survey area based on the updated
pre-flight sensitivities of AKARI, taking into account the cirrus confusion
noise as well as the surface density of bright stars. The North Ecliptic Pole
(NEP) is concluded to be the best area for 2-26 (mu)m deep surveys, while the
low-cirrus noise regions around the South Ecliptic Pole (SEP) are worth
considering for 50-180 (mu)m pointed surveys to high sensitivities limited by
the galaxy confusion noise. Current observational plans of these pointed
surveys are described in detail. Comparing these surveys with the deep surveys
with the Spitzer Space Telescope, the AKARI deep surveys are particularly
unique in respect of their continuous wavelength coverage over the 2-26 (mu)m
range in broad-band deep imaging, and their slitless spectroscopy mode over the
same wavelength range.",2006-05-23T13:55:50Z
Dark viscous fluid described by a unified equation of state in cosmology,"We generalize the $\Lambda$CDM model by introducing a unified EOS to describe
the Universe contents modeled as dark viscous fluid, motivated by the fact that
a single constant equation of state (EOS) $p=-p_0$ ($p_0>0$) reproduces the
$\Lambda$CDM model exactly. This EOS describes the perfect fluid term, the
dissipative effect, and the cosmological constant in a unique framework and the
Friedmann equations can be analytically solved. Especially, we find a relation
between the EOS parameter and the renormalizable condition of a scalar field.
We develop a completely numerical method to perform a $\chi^2$ minimization to
constrain the parameters in a cosmological model directly from the Friedmann
equations, and employ the SNe data with the parameter $\mathcal{A}$ measured
from the SDSS data to constrain our model. The result indicates that the

  Decimeter to Decameter Wavelengths","The results of simultaneous multifrequency observations of giant radio pulses
from the Crab pulsar, PSR B0531+21, at 23, 111, and 600 MHz are presented and
analyzed. Giant pulses were detected at a frequency as low as 23 MHz for the
first time. Of the 45 giant pulses detected at 23 MHz, 12 were identified with
counterparts observed simultaneously at 600 MHz. Of the 128 giant pulses
detected at 111 MHz, 21 were identified with counterparts observed
simultaneously at 600 MHz. The spectral indices for the power-law frequency
dependence of the giant-pulse energies are from -3.1 to -1.6. The mean spectral
index is -2.7 +/- 0.1 and is the same for both frequency combinations (600-111
MHz and 600-23 MHz). The large scatter in the spectral indices of the
individual pulses and the large number of unidentified giant pulses suggest
that the spectra of the individual giant pulses do not actually follow a simple
power law. The observed shapes of the giant pulses at all three frequencies are
determined by scattering on interstellar plasma irregularities. The scatter
broadening of the pulses and its frequency dependence were determined as
tau_sc=20*(f/100)^(-3.5 +/- 0.1) ms, where the frequency f is in MHz.",2006-06-01T13:51:01Z
An Eccentric Hot Jupiter Orbiting the Subgiant HD 185269,"We report the detection of a Jupiter-mass planet in a 6.838 day orbit around
the 1.28 solar mass subgiant HD 185269. The eccentricity of HD 185269b (e =
0.30) is unusually large compared to other planets within 0.1 AU of their
stars. Photometric observations demonstrate that the star is constant to
+/-0.0001 mag on the radial velocity period, strengthening our interpretation
of a planetary companion. This planet was detected as part of our radial
velocity survey of evolved stars located on the subgiant branch of the H-R
diagram--also known as the Hertzsprung Gap. These stars, which have masses
between 1.2 and 2.5 solar masses, play an important role in the investigation
of the frequency of extrasolar planets as a function of stellar mass.",2006-08-01T20:16:26Z
Radio continuum monitoring of the extreme carbon star IRC+10216,"We describe Very Large Array observations of the extreme carbon star
IRC+10216 at 8.4, 14.9, and 22.5 GHz made over a two year period. We find
possible variability correlated with the infrared phase and a cm- to
sub-millimeter wavelength spectral index very close to 2. The variability,
observed flux densities, and upper limit on the size are consistent with the
emission arising from the stellar photosphere or a slightly larger radio
photosphere.",2006-03-21T19:54:45Z
"X-ray Radiation from the Annihilation of Dark Matter at the Galactic
  Center","The existing and upcoming multiwavelength data from the Galactic Center
suggest a comparative study in order to propose or rule out possible models
which would explain the observations. In this paper we consider the X-ray
synchrotron and the gamma-ray emission due to Kaluza Klein Dark Matter and
define a set of parameters for the shape of the Dark Matter halo which is
consistent with the observations. We show that for this class of models the
existing Chandra X-ray data is more restrictive than the constraints on very
high energy gamma-rays coming from HESS.",2006-07-14T10:18:34Z
Imprint of galaxy formation and evolution on globular cluster properties,"We discuss the origin of physical properties of globular cluster systems
(GCSs) in galaxies in terms of galaxy formation and evolution processes. Based
on numerical simulations of dynamical evolution of GCSs in galaxies, we
particularly discuss (1) the origin of radial density profiles of GCSs, (2)
kinematics of GCSs in elliptical galaxies, (3) transformation from nucleated
dwarf galaxies into GCs (e.g., omega Centauri), and (4) the origin of GCSs in
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).",2006-05-13T08:31:48Z
LP 714-37: A wide pair of ultracool dwarfs actually is a triple,"LP 714-37 was identified by Phan-Bao et al. (2005) as one of the very few
wide pairs of very low mass (VLM) stars known to date, with a separation of 33
AU. Here we present adaptive optics imaging which resolves the secondary of the
wide pair into a tighter binary, with a projected angular separation of 0.36
arcsec, or 7 AU. The estimated spectral types of LP 714-37B and LP 714-37C are
M8.0 and M8.5. We discuss the implications of this finding for brown dwarf
formation scenarios.",2006-05-15T16:40:52Z
"X-rays from the Globular Cluster G1: Intermediate Mass Black Hole or Low
  Mass X-ray Binary?","The globular cluster G1 (Mayall II) in M31 is the most massive (~10^7 M_sun)
stellar cluster in the Local Group, and it has the highest central velocity
dispersion (~28 km/s). It has been claimed to host a central ~20,000 M_sun
black hole, but these claims have been controversial. We report here the
XMM-Newton detection of X-ray emission from G1 at a level of Lx ~ 2x10^{36}
erg/s. This emission could be the result of Bondi-Hoyle accretion of ionized
cluster gas by a central black hole, or it could be produced by a conventional
low-mass X-ray binary. A precise localization of the X-ray emission, which is
not possible with the current XMM data, could distinguish between these
possibilities. While such a measurement may be difficult, it is of sufficient
potential importance to pursue.",2006-05-02T00:52:57Z
A Transiting Planet of a Sun-like Star,"A planet transits an 11th magnitude, G1V star in the constellation Corona
Borealis. We designate the planet XO-1b, and the star, XO-1, also known as GSC
02041-01657. XO-1 lacks a trigonometric distance; we estimate it to be 200+-20
pc. Of the ten stars currently known to host extrasolar transiting planets, the
star XO-1 is the most similar to the Sun in its physical characteristics: its
radius is 1.0+-0.08 R_Sun, its mass is 1.0+-0.03 M_Sun, V sini < 3 km/s, and
its metallicity [Fe/H] is 0.015+-0.04. The orbital period of the planet XO-1b
is 3.941534+-0.000027 days, one of the longer ones known. The planetary mass is
0.90+-0.07 M_Jupiter, which is marginally larger than that of other transiting
planets with periods between 3 and 4 days. Both the planetary radius and the
inclination are functions of the spectroscopically determined stellar radius.
If the stellar radius is 1.0+-0.08 R_Sun, then the planetary radius is
1.30+-0.11 R_Jupiter and the inclination of the orbit is 87.7+-1.2 degrees. We
have demonstrated a productive international collaboration between professional
and amateur astronomers that was important to distinguishing this planet from
many other similar candidates.",2006-05-17T14:16:14Z
Diffuse Interstellar Bands and Their Families,"Diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) still await an explanation. One expects
that some progress in this field will be possible when all the known DIBs are
divided into families in such a way that only one carrier is responsible for
all bands belonging to the given family. Analysing high resolution optical
spectra of reddened stars we try to find out spectroscopic families for two
prominent DIBs, at 5780 and 5797 angstroms. Among the DIBs, observed in the
spectral range from 5590 to 6830 angstroms, we have found 8 candidates to
belong to 5780 spectroscopic family and the other 12 DIBs candidating to family
of 5797 structure.",2006-07-07T09:10:47Z
Carbon stars in local group dwarf galaxies: C and O abundances,"We present abundances of carbon and oxygen as well as abundance ratios
12C/13C for a sample of carbon stars in the LMC, SMC, Carina, Sculptor and
Fornax dwarf galaxies. The overall metallicities in these dwarf galaxies are
lower than in the galactic disc. The observations cover most of the AGB and we
discuss the abundance patterns in different regions along the AGB. The
abundances are determined from infrared spectra obtained with the ISAAC
spectrometer on VLT (R=1500) and the Phoenix Spectrometer on Gemini South
(R=50000). The synthetic spectra used in the analysis were computed with MARCS
model atmospheres. We find that the oxygen abundance is decreasing with
decreasing overall metallicity of the system while the C/O ratio at a given
evolutionary phase is increasing with decreasing oxygen abundance. keywords

"Optical spectroscopy of (candidate) ultra-compact X-ray binaries:
  constraints on the composition of the donor stars","We present optical spectroscopy of several (candidate) ultra-compact X-ray
binaries (UCXBs) obtained with the ESO VLT and Gemini-North telescopes. In only
one of five observed UCXB candidates did we find evidence for H in its spectrum
(4U 1556-60). For XB 1905+00 the optical counterpart is not detected. For the
known UCXBs 4U 1626-67 and XB 1916-05 we find spectra consistent with a C/O and
a He/N accretion disc respectively, the latter is the first optical spectrum of
a He-rich donor in an UCXB. Interestingly, the C/O spectrum of 4U 1626-67 shows
both similarities as well as marked differences from the optical C/O spectrum
of 4U 0614+09. We obtained phase resolved spectroscopy of 4U 0614+09 and the 44
min transient XTE J0929-314. In neither object were we able to detect clear
orbital periodicities, highlighting the difficulties of period determinations
in UCXBs. We reanalysed the spectra of XTE J0929-314 that were taken close to
the peak of its 2003 X-ray outburst and do not confirm the detection of Halpha
emission as was claimed in the literature. The peak spectra do show strong C or
N emission around 4640A, as has also been detected in other UCXBs. We discuss
the implications of our findings for our understanding of the formation of
UCXBs and the Galactic population of UCXBs. At the moment all studied systems
are consistent with having white dwarf donors, the majority being C/O rich.",2006-04-28T07:23:27Z
"The End of the Reionization Epoch Probed by Ly-alpha Emitters at z=6.5
  in the Subaru Deep Field","We report an extensive search for Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) at z=6.5 in the
Subaru Deep Field. Subsequent spectroscopy with Subaru and Keck identified
eight more LAEs, giving a total of 17 spectroscopically confirmed LAEs at
z=6.5. Based on this spectroscopic sample of 17, complemented by a photometric
sample of 58 LAEs, we have derived a more accurate Lyman-alpha luminosity
function of LAEs at z=6.5, which reveals an apparent deficit at the bright end
of ~0.75 mag fainter L*, compared with that observed at z=5.7. The difference
in the LAE luminosity functions between z=5.7 and 6.5 is significant at the
3-sigma level, which is reduced to 2-sigma when cosmic variance is taken into
account. This result may imply that the reionization of the universe has not
been completed at z=6.5. We found that the spatial distribution of LAEs at
z=6.5 was homogeneous over the field. We discuss the implications of these
results for the reionization of the universe.",2006-04-06T22:40:10Z
The bright optical flash from GRB 060117,"We present a discovery and observation of an extraordinarily bright prompt
optical emission of the GRB 060117 obtained by a wide-field camera atop the
robotic telescope FRAM of the Pierre Auger Observatory from 2 to 10 minutes
after the GRB. We found rapid average temporal flux decay of alpha = -1.7 +-
0.1 and a peak brightness R = 10.1 mag. Later observations by other instruments
set a strong limit on the optical and radio transient fluxes, unveiling an
unexpectedly rapid further decay. We present an interpretation featuring a
relatively steep electron-distribution parameter p ~ 3.0 and providing a
straightforward solution for the overall fast decay of this optical transient
as a transition between reverse and forward shock.",2006-06-01T19:35:30Z
"High-resolution mapping of interstellar clouds with near-infrared
  scattered light","With current wide-field near-infrared (NIR) instruments the scattered light
in the near-infrared can be mapped over large areas. Below A_V ~ 10 the surface
brightness is directly proportional to the column density, and at slightly
higher column densities the saturation of the intensity values can be corrected
using the ratios of the intensity in different NIR bands. NIR scattered light
provides a promising new method for the mapping of quiescent interstellar
clouds. We develop a method to convert the observed near-infrared surface
brightness into estimates of the column density. We study and quantify the
effect that different error sources could have on the accuracy of such
estimates. We also propose to reduce systematic errors by combining surface
brightness data with extinction measurements derived from the near-infrared
colour excess of background stars. Our study is based on a set of
three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations. Maps of
near-infrared scattered light are obtained with radiative transfer
calculations, and the maps are converted back into column density estimates
using the proposed method. The results are compared with the true column
densities. Extinction measurements are simulated using the same turbulence
simulations, and are used as a complementary column density tracer. We find
that NIR intensities can be converted into a reliable estimate of the column
density in regions with A_V up to almost 20mag.",2006-03-14T15:33:38Z
"The impacts of dark matter particle annihilation on recombination and
  the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background","The recombination history of the Universe provides a useful tool for
constraining the annihilation of dark matter particles. Even a small fraction
of dark matter particles annihilated during the cosmic dark age can provide
sufficient energy to affect the ionization state of the baryonic gas. Although
this effect is too small for neutralinos, lighter dark matter particle
candidates, e.g. with mass of 1-100 MeV, which was proposed recently to explain
the observed excess of positrons in the Galactic Center, may generate
observable differences in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and
polarization anisotropies. The annihilations at the era of recombination
affects mainly the CMB anisotropy at small angular scales (large $\ell$), and
is distinctively different from the effect of early reionization. We perform a
multi-parameter analysis of the CMB data, including the both the WMAP first
year and three year data, and the ACBAR, Boomerang, CBI, and VSA data. Assuming
that the observed excess of $e^+e^-$ pairs in the galactic center region is
produced by dark matter annihilation, and that a sizable fraction of the energy
produced in the annihilation is deposited in the baryonic gas during
recombination, we obtain a %95 dark matter mass limit of $M<8 \MeV$ with the
current data set.",2006-03-16T15:46:33Z
"BUCS: An Engine For Generating Realistic Imaging Data for Deep Galaxy
  Fields","Today's deep high resolution multiwavelength surveys contain a wealth of
information about galaxies at different epochs. To fully exploit this
information, it is useful to be able to produce highly realistic simulations to
compare with the observations. Here, we describe one such simulator for
producing imaging data for deep galaxy fields. Based upon a pixel-by-pixel
modelling of object SEDs and their selection volumes, this simulator allows
users to make realistic multicolor simulations of galaxy fields from galaxy
samples at all redshifts. Input samples for this simulator range from z~0
samples selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to z~1-6 samples selected
from the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey. Users can specify the
passbands, noise, and PSFs, or equivalently the exposure times on well-known
instruments like HST or ground-based telescopes.",2006-05-31T05:20:08Z
"Probing long-period companions to planetary hosts. VLT and CFHT near
  infrared coronographic imaging surveys","We present the results of a deep imaging survey of stars surrounded by
planets detected with the radial velocity technique. The purpose is to search
for and to characterize long-period stellar and substellar companions. The
sample contains a total of 26 stars, among which 6 exhibit additional radial
velocity drifts. We used NACO, at the ESO Very Large Telescope, and PUEO-KIR,
at the Candian French Hawaiian Telescope, to conduct a near-infrared
coronographic survey with adaptive optics of the faint circumstellar
environment of the planetary hosts. The domain investigated ranges between 0.1
to 15"" (i.e. about 3 to 500 AU, according to the mean distance of the sample).
The survey is sensitive to companions within the stellar and the substellar
domains, depending on the distance to the central stars and on the star
properties. The images of 14 stars do not reveal any companions once the field
objects are removed. 8 stars have close potential companions that need to be
re-observed within 1-2 years to check for physical companionship. 4 stars are
surrounded by faint objects which are confirmed or very probable companions.
The companion to HD13445 (Gliese 86) is already known. The HD196885 star is a
new close visual binary system with a high probability of being bound. The 2
newly discovered companions, HD1237 B and HD27442 B, share common proper
motions with the central stars. Orbital motion is detected for HD1237 B. HD1237
B is likely a low-mass M star, located at 70 AU (projected distance) from the
primary. HD27442 B is most probably a white dwarf companion located at about
240 AU (projected distance).",2006-06-07T19:48:21Z
The Scientific Programme of Planck,"For 40 years, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) has been the most
important source of information about the geometry and contents of the
Universe. Even so, only a small fraction of the information available in the
CMB has been extracted to date. Planck, the third space CMB mission after COBE
and WMAP, is designed to extract essentially all of the information in the CMB
temperature anisotropies. Planck will also measure to high accuracy the
polarization of CMB anisotropies, which encodes not only a wealth of
cosmological information but also provides a unique probe of the thermal
history of the Universe during the time when the first stars and galaxies
formed. Polarization measurements may also detect the signature of a stochastic
background of gravitational waves generated during inflation, 10^(-35) s after
the Big Bang. This book describes the expected scientific output of the Planck
mission, both cosmological and non-cosmological. Chapter 1 summarizes the
experimental concept and the operation of the satellite. Chapter 2 covers the
core cosmological science of the mission, describing the measurements that
Planck will make, what we expect to learn from them about the geometry and
contents of the Universe and about fundamental physics, and the combination of
CMB data with other data to provide additional insights. Although the primary
goal of Planck is cosmology, it will survey the whole sky with an unprecedented
combination of frequency coverage, angular resolution, and sensitivity,
providing data valuable for a broad range of astrophysics. Chapters 3, 4, and 5
describe non-cosmological astrophysical uses of the Planck data. This book can
also be downloaded directly from http://www.rssd.esa.int/Planck .",2006-04-04T17:35:31Z
"The Rest-frame Optical Colors of 99,000 SDSS Galaxies","We synthesize the rest-frame Stroemgren colors using SDSS spectra for 99,088
galaxies selected from Data Release 1. This narrow-band ~200 AA photometric
system (uz, vz, bz, yz), first designed for the determination of effective
temperature, metallicity and gravity of stars, measures the continuum spectral
slope of galaxies in the rest-frame 3200-5800 AA wavelength range. Galaxies
form a remarkably narrow locus (~0.03 mag) in the resulting color-color
diagram. The Bruzual & Charlot population synthesis models suggest that the
position of a galaxy along this locus is controlled by a degenerate combination
of metallicity and age of the dominant stellar population. Galaxy distribution
along the locus is bimodal, with the local minimum corresponding to an ~1 Gyr
old single stellar population. The position perpendicular to the locus is
independent of metallicity and age, and reflects the galaxy's dust content, as
implied by both the models and the statistics of IRAS detections. A comparison
of this locus with the galaxy locus in the H_delta-D_n(4000) diagram, utilized
by Kauffmann et al. (2003) to estimate stellar masses, reveals a tight
correlation, although the two analyzed spectral ranges barely overlap. Overall,
the galaxy spectral energy distribution in the entire UV to near-IR range can
be described as a single-parameter family with an accuracy of 0.1 mag, or
better. This nearly one-dimensional distribution of galaxies in the
multi-dimensional space of measured parameters strongly supports the conclusion
of Yip et al. (2004), based on a principal component analysis, that SDSS galaxy
spectra can be described by a small number of eigenspectra. Apparently, the
contributions of stellar populations that dominate the optical emission from
galaxies are combined in a simple and well-defined way.",2006-06-14T18:58:37Z
"A model-independent dark energy reconstruction scheme using the
  geometrical form of the luminosity-distance relation","We put forward a new model-independent reconstruction scheme for dark energy
which utilises the expected geometrical features of the luminosity-distance
relation. The important advantage of this scheme is that it does not assume
explicit ansatzes for cosmological parameters but only some very general
cosmological properties via the geometrical features of the reconstructed
luminosity-distance relation. Using the recently released supernovae data by
the Supernova Legacy Survey together with a phase space representation, we show
that the reconstructed luminosity-distance curves best fitting the data
correspond to a slightly varying dark energy density with the Universe
expanding slightly slower than the Lambda CDM model. However, the Lambda CDM
model fits the data at 1 sigma significance level and the fact that our best
fitting luminosity-distance curve is lower than that of the corresponding
Lambda CDM model could be due to systematics. The transition from an
accelerating to a decelerating expansion occurs at a redshift larger than
z=0.35. Interpreting the dark energy as a minimally coupled scalar field we
also reconstruct the scalar field and its potential. We constrain
$\Omega_{m_0}$ using the baryon acoustic oscillation peak in the SDSS luminous
red galaxy sample and find that the best fit is obtained with
$\Omega_{m_0}=0.27$, in agreement with the CMB data.",2006-06-18T18:32:09Z
"Optimal placement of a limited number of observations for period
  searches","Robotic telescopes present the opportunity for the sparse temporal placement
of observations when period searching. We address the best way to place a
limited number of observations to cover the dynamic range of frequencies
required by an observer. We show that an observation distribution geometrically
spaced in time can minimise aliasing effects arising from sparse sampling,
substantially improving signal detection quality. The base of the geometric
series is however a critical factor in the overall success of this strategy.
Further, we show that for such an optimal distribution observations may be
reordered, as long as the distribution of spacings is preserved, with almost no
loss of quality. This implies that optimal observing strategies can retain
significant flexibility in the face of scheduling constraints, by providing
scope for on-the-fly adaptation. Finally, we present optimal geometric
samplings for a wide range of common observing scenarios, with an emphasis on
practical application by the observer at the telescope. Such a sampling
represents the best practical empirical solution to the undersampling problem
that we are aware of. The technique has applications to robotic telescope and
satellite observing strategies, where target acquisition overheads mean that a
greater total target exposure time (and hence signal-to-noise) can often in
practice be achieved by limiting the number of observations.",2006-05-17T16:39:30Z
"The importance of interloper removal in galaxy clusters: saving more
  objects for the Jeans analysis","We study the effect of contamination by interlopers in kinematic samples of
galaxy clusters. We demonstrate that without the proper removal of interlopers
the inferred parameters of the mass distribution in the cluster are strongly
biased towards higher mass and lower concentration. The interlopers are removed
using two procedures previously shown to work most efficiently on simulated
data. One is based on using the virial mass estimator and calculating the
maximum velocity available to cluster members and the other relies on the ratio
of the virial and projected mass estimators. We illustrate the performance of
the methods in detail using the example of A576, a cluster with a strong
uniform background contamination, and compare the case of A576 to 15 other
clusters with different degree of contamination. We model the velocity
dispersion and kurtosis profiles obtained for the cleaned data samples of these
clusters solving the Jeans equations to estimate the mass, concentration and
anisotropy parameter. We present the mass-concentration relation for the total
sample of 22 clusters.",2006-06-26T08:02:15Z
"A Fundamental Relation Between Compact Stellar Nuclei, Supermassive
  Black Holes, and Their Host Galaxies","Imaging surveys with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have shown that roughly
50-80% of low- and intermediate-luminosity galaxies contain a compact stellar
nucleus at their center, regardless of host galaxy morphological type. We
combine HST imaging for early-type galaxies from the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey
with ground-based long-slit spectra from KPNO to show that the masses of
compact stellar nuclei in Virgo Cluster galaxies obey a tight correlation with
the masses of the host galaxies. The same correlation is obeyed by the
supermassive black holes (SBHs) found in predominantly massive galaxies. The
compact stellar nuclei in the Local Group galaxies M33 and NGC205 are also
found to fall along this same scaling relation. These results indicate that a
generic by-product of galaxy formation is the creation of a Central Massive
Object (CMO) -- either a SBH or a compact stellar nucleus -- that contains a
mean fraction, ~ 0.2%, of the total galactic mass. In galaxies with masses
greater than a few times 10^10 solar masses, SBHs appear to be the dominant
mode of CMO formation.",2006-03-30T23:04:30Z
IR-source IRAS20508+2011: spectral variability of the central star,"Over the five years of high-resolution spectroscopy of the cool star
identified with the IR source IRAS20508+2011, the photospheric radial velocity
variability Vr=15-30km/s is detected. In the same time, the Halpha profile
varied from an intense bell-shaped emission line with a small absorption to
2-peaked emission with a central absorption feature below the continuum level.
The NaD doublet lines shown a complex profile with broad (FWHM \approx 120km/s)
emission and photospheric absorption, as well as an interstellar component. We
used model atmospheres to determine the physical parameters and chemical
composition of the star's atmosphere: Te=4800K, log g=1.5, [Fe/H]=-0.36, [O/Fe]
=+1.79 (with the ratio [C/O]=-0.9). The totality of the parameters suggests
that the optical component of IRAS20508+2011 is an O-rich AGB star with
luminosity Mv",2006-05-06T12:30:08Z
B polarization of cosmic microwave background as a tracer of strings,"String models can produce successful inflationary scenarios in the context of
brane collisions and in many of these models cosmic strings may also be
produced. In scenarios such as KKLMMT the string contribution is naturally
predicted to be well below the inflationary signal for cosmic microwave
background (CMB) temperature anisotropies, in agreement with the existing
limits. We find that for $B$ type polarization of CMB the situation is reversed
and the dominant signal comes from vector modes generated by cosmic strings,
which exceeds the gravity wave signal from both inflation and strings. The
signal can be detected for a broad range of parameter space: future
polarization experiments may be able to detect the string signal down to the
string tension $G\mu=10^{-9}$, although foregrounds and lensing are likely to
worsen these limits. We argue that the optimal scale to search for the string
signature is at $\ell\sim 1000$, but in models with high optical depth the
signal from reionization peak at large scales is also significant. The shape of
the power spectrum allows one to distinguish the string signature from the
gravity waves from inflation, but only with a sufficiently high angular
resolution experiment",2006-04-06T17:35:24Z
Angular Momentum Transfer in Dark Matter Halos: Erasing the Cusp,"We propose that angular momentum transfer from the baryons to the Dark Matter
(DM) during the early stages of galaxy formation can flatten the halo inner
density profile and modify the halo dynamics. We compute the phase-space
distribution function of DM halos, that corresponds to the density and
anisotropy profiles obtained from N-body simulations in the concordance
cosmology. We then describe an injection of angular momentum into the halo by
modifying the distribution function, and show that the system evolves into a
new equilibrium configuration; the latter features a constant central density
and a tangentially-dominated anisotropy profile in the inner regions, while the
structure is nearly unchanged beyond 10% of the virial radius. Then we propose
a toy model to account for such a halo evolution, based on the angular momentum
exchange due to dynamical friction; at the epoch of galaxy formation this is
efficiently exerted by the DM onto the gas clouds spiralling down the potential
well. The comparison between the angular momentum profile gained by the halo
through dynamical friction and that provided by the perturbed distribution
function reveals a surprising similarity, hinting at the reliability of the
process.",2006-03-02T15:06:06Z
"The secrets of the nearest starburst cluster: II. The present-day mass
  function in NGC 3603","Based on deep VLT/ISAAC JHK photometry, we have derived the present-day mass
function of the central starburst cluster NGC 3603 YC (Young Cluster) in the
giant HII region NGC 3603. The effects of field contamination, individual
reddening, and a possible binary contribution are investigated. The MF slopes
resulting from the different methods are compared, and lead to a surprisingly
consistent cluster MF with a slope of Gamma = -0.9 +/- 0.15. Analyzing
different radial annuli around the cluster core, no significant change in the
slope of the MF is observed. However, mass segregation in the cluster is
evidenced by the increasing depletion of the high-mass tail of the stellar mass
distribution with increasing radius. We discuss the indications of mass
segregation with respect to the changes observed in the binned and cumulative
stellar mass functions, and argue that the cumulative function as well as the
fraction of high- to low-mass stars provide better indicators for mass
segregation than the MF slope alone. (abridged)",2006-04-14T18:48:20Z
Protecting Life in the Milky Way: Metals Keep the GRBs Away,"The host galaxies of the five local, z<0.25, long-duration gamma-ray bursts,
each of which had a well-documented associated supernova, are all faint and
metal-poor compared to the population of local star-forming galaxies. We
quantify this statement by using a previous analysis of star-forming galaxies
(z<0.2) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to estimate the fraction of local
star formation as a function of host galaxy oxygen abundance. We find that only
a small fraction (<25%) of current star formation occurs in galaxies with
oxygen abundance 12+log(O/H)<8.6, i.e., about half that of the Milky Way.
However, all five low-z GRB hosts have oxygen abundance below this limit, in
three cases very significantly so. If GRBs traced local star formation
independent of metallicity, the probability of obtaining such low abundances
for all five hosts would be P~0.1%. We conclude that GRBs trace only
low-metallicity star formation, and that the Milky Way has been too metal rich
to host long GRBs for at least the last several billion years. This result has
implications for the potential role of GRBs in mass extinctions, for searches
for recent burst remnants in the Milky Way and other large galaxies, for
non-detections of late radio emission from local core-collapse supernovae, and
for the production of cosmic rays in the local Universe. We also find that the
isotropic energy release of these five GRBs, E_iso, steeply decreases with
increasing host oxygen abundance, suggesting an upper metallicity limit for
``cosmological'' GRBs at ~0.15 Z_solar. (Abridged)",2006-04-06T17:04:08Z
"The Luminosity Function of Nearby Galaxy Clusters II: Redshifts and
  Luminosity Function for Galaxies in the Region of the Centaurus Cluster","We acquired spectra for a random sample of galaxies within a 0.83 square
degree region centered on the core of the Centaurus cluster. Radial velocities
were obtained for 225 galaxies to limiting magnitudes of V < 19.5. Of the
galaxies for which velocities were obtained, we find 35% to be member galaxies.
Of the 78 member galaxies, magnitudes range from 11.8 < V < 18.5 (-21.6 < M_{V}
< -14.9 for H_o = 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1) with a limiting central surface brightness
of \mu_o < 22.5 mag arcsec^-2. We constructed the cluster galaxy luminosity
function by using these spectroscopic results to calculate the expected
fraction of cluster members in each magnitude bin. The faint-end slope of the
luminosity function using this method is shallower than the one obtained using
a statistical method to correct for background galaxy contamination. We also
use the spectroscopy results to define surface brightness criteria to establish
membership for the full sample. Using these criteria, we find a luminosity
function very similar to the one constructed with the statistical background
correction. For both, we find a faint-end slope alpha ~ -1.4. Adjusting the
surface brightness membership criteria we find that the data are consistent
with a faint-end slope as shallow as -1.22 or as steep as -1.50. We describe in
this paper some of the limitations of using these methods for constructing the
galaxy luminosity function.",2006-03-19T00:50:27Z
On the formation of H-alpha line emission around classical T Tauri stars,"We present radiative transfer models of the circumstellar environment of
classical T Tauri stars, concentrating on the formation of the H-alpha
emission. The wide variety of line profiles seen in observations are indicative
of both inflow and outflow, and we therefore employ a circumstellar structure
that includes both magnetospheric accretion and a disc wind. We perform
systematic investigations of the model parameters for the wind and the
magnetosphere to search for possible geometrical and physical conditions which
lead to the types of profiles seen in observations. We find that the hybrid
models can reproduce the wide range of profile types seen in observations, and
that the most common profile types observed occupy a large volume of parameter
space. Conversely, the most infrequently observed profile morphologies require
a very specific set of models parameters. We find our model profiles are
consistent with the canonical value of the mass-loss rate to mass-accretion
rate ratio (mu=0.1) found in earlier magneto-hydrodynamic calculations and
observations, but the models with 0.05<mu<0.2 are still in accord with observed
H-alpha profiles. We investigate the wind contribution to the line profile as a
function of model parameters, and examine the reliability of H-alpha as a mass
accretion diagnostic. Finally, we examine the H-alpha spectroscopic
classification used by Reipurth et. al, and discuss the basic physical
conditions that are required to reproduce the profiles in each classified type.",2006-05-09T14:11:36Z
The Properties of Galaxies in Voids,"We present a comparison of the properties of galaxies in the most underdense
regions of the Universe, where the galaxy number density is less than 10% of
the mean density, with galaxies from more typical regions. We have compiled a
sample of galaxies in 46 large nearby voids that were identified using the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR4, which provides the largest coverage of the sky.
We study the u-r color distribution, morphology, specific star formation rate,
and radial number density profiles for a total of 495 galaxies fainter than
M_r=-20.4 +5logh located inside the voids and compare these properties with a
control sample of field galaxies. We show that there is an excess of blue
galaxies inside the voids. However, inspecting the properties of blue and red
galaxies separately, we find that galaxy properties such as color distribution,
bulge-to-total ratios, and concentrations are remarkably similar between the
void and overall sample. The void galaxies also show the same specific star
formation rate at fixed color as the control galaxies. We compare our results
with the predictions of cosmological simulations of galaxy formation using the
Millennium Run semi-analytic galaxy catalog. We show that the properties of the
simulated galaxies in large voids are in reasonably good agreement with those
found in similar environments in the real Universe. To summarize, in spite of
the fact that galaxies in voids live in the least dense large-scale
environment, this environment makes very little impact on properties of
galaxies.",2006-05-29T19:38:35Z
"Local Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and synchrotron modulation in Pulsar
  Wind Nebulae","We present here a series of numerical simulations of the development of
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in a relativistically hot plasma. The physical
parameters in the unperturbed state are chosen to be representative of local
conditions encountered in Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe), with a main magnetic
field perpendicular to a mildly relativistic shear layers. By using a numerical
code for Relativistic MHD, we investigate the effect of an additional magnetic
field component aligned with the shear velocity, and we follow the evolution of
the instability to the saturation and turbulent regimes. Based on the resulting
flow structure, we then compute synchrotron maps in order to evaluate the
signature of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the emission and we investigate
how the time scale and the amplitude of the synchrotron modulations depend on
shear velocity and magnetic field. Finally we compare our results to the
observed variable features in the Crab Nebula. We show that the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability cannot account for the wisps variability, but it
might be responsible for the time dependent filamentary structure observed in
the main torus.",2006-03-17T20:41:54Z
Interloper treatment in dynamical modelling of galaxy clusters,"The aim of this paper is to study the efficiency of different approaches to
interloper treatment in dynamical modelling of galaxy clusters. Using
cosmological N-body simulation of standard LCDM model, we select 10 massive
dark matter haloes and use their particles to emulate mock kinematic data in
terms of projected galaxy positions and velocities as they would be measured by
a distant observer. Taking advantage of the full 3D information available from
the simulation, we select samples of interlopers defined with different
criteria. The interlopers thus selected provide means to assess the efficiency
of different interloper removal schemes found in the literature. We study
direct methods of interloper removal based on dynamical or statistical
restrictions imposed on ranges of positions and velocities available to cluster
members. In determining these ranges, we use either the velocity dispersion
criterion or a maximum velocity profile. We also generalize the common
approaches taking into account both the position and velocity information.
Another criterion is based on the dependence of the commonly used virial mass
and projected mass estimators on the presence of interlopers. We find that the
direct methods exclude on average 60-70 percent of unbound particles producing
a sample with contamination as low as 2-4 percent. Next, we consider indirect
methods of interloper treatment which are applied to the data stacked from many
objects. In these approaches, interlopers are treated in a statistical way as a
uniform background which modifies the distribution of cluster members. Using a
Bayesian approach, we reproduce the properties of composite clusters and
estimate the probability of finding an interloper as a function of distance
from the object centre.",2006-06-23T07:46:52Z
Dark energy in motion,"Recent large-scale peculiar velocity surveys suggest that large matter
volumes could be moving with appreciable velocity with respect to the CMB rest
frame. If confirmed, such results could conflict with the Cosmological
Principle according to which the matter and CMB rest frames should converge on
very large scales. In this work we explore the possibility that such large
scale bulk flows are due, not to the motion of matter with respect to the CMB,
but to the flow of dark energy with respect to matter. Indeed, when dark energy
is moving, the usual definition of the CMB rest frame as that in which the CMB
dipole vanishes is not appropriate. We find instead that the dipole vanishes
for observers at rest with respect to the cosmic center of mass, i.e. in motion
with respect to the background radiation.",2006-05-16T09:10:55Z
Observational constraints on self-accelerating cosmology,"The DGP brane-world model provides a simple alternative to the standard LCDM
cosmology, with the same number of parameters. There is no dark energy - the
late universe self-accelerates due to an infrared modification of gravity. We
compute the joint constraints on the DGP model from supernovae, the cosmic
microwave background shift parameter, and the baryon oscillation peak in the
SDSS luminous red galaxy sample. Flat DGP models are within the joint 2 sigma
contour, but the LCDM model provides a significantly better fit to the data.
These tests are based on the background dynamics of the DGP model, and we
comment on further tests that involve structure formation.",2006-03-14T15:31:19Z
The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array: Overview & status,"The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is an international
radio telescope under construction in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile.
ALMA will be situated on a high-altitude site at 5000 m elevation which
provides excellent atmospheric transmission over the instrument wavelength
range of 0.3 to 3 mm. ALMA will be comprised of two key observing components:
an array of up to sixty-four 12-m diameter antennas arranged in a multiple
configurations ranging in size from 0.15 to ~14 km, and a set of four 12-m and
twelve 7-m antennas operating in closely-packed configurations ~50m in diameter

and total-power astronomical information. High-sensitivity dual-polarization 8
GHz-bandwidth spectral-line and continuum measurements between all antennas

The B-Supergiant Components of the Double-Lined Binary HD1383,"We present new results from a study of high quality, red spectra of the
massive binary star system HD 1383 (B0.5 Ib + B0.5 Ib). We determined radial
velocities and revised orbital elements (P = 20.28184 +/- 0.0002 d) and made
Doppler tomographic reconstructions of the component spectra. A comparison of
these with model spectra from non-LTE, line blanketed atmospheres indicates
that both stars have almost identical masses (M_2/M_1 = 1.020 +/- 0.014),
temperatures (T_eff = 28000 +/- 1000 K), gravities (log g = 3.25 +/- 0.25), and
projected rotational velocities (V sin i < 30 km/s). We investigate a number of
constraints on the radii and masses of the stars based upon the absence of
eclipses, surface gravity, stellar wind terminal velocity, and probable
location in the Perseus spiral arm of the Galaxy, and these indicate a range in
probable radius and mass of R/R_sun = 14 - 20 and M/M_sun = 16 - 35,
respectively. These values are consistent with model evolutionary masses for
single stars of this temperature and gravity. Both stars are much smaller than
their respective Roche radii, so the system is probably in a pre-contact stage
of evolution. A fit of the system's spectral energy distribution yields a
reddening of E(B-V)=0.55 +/- 0.05 and a ratio of total-to-selective extinction
of R=2.97 +/- 0.15. We find no evidence of H-alpha emission from colliding
stellar winds, which is probably the consequence of the low gas densities in
the colliding winds zone.",2006-04-11T18:14:18Z
Ten Facts of Life for Distant Supersoft Sources,"First discovered in the Magellanic Clouds and in the Milky Way, the largest
pools of luminous supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) now known lie in M31 and in
more distant galaxies. Hundreds of newly-discovered SSSs are helping us to test
models for Type Ia supernovae and to identify SSSs that may represent a wider
range of physical systems, including accreting intermediate-mass black holes.
In this short report we list ten intriguing facts about distant SSSs.",2006-06-14T21:00:05Z
Sub-Structures in the Halo of the Milky Way,"The latest results of the QUEST survey for RR Lyrae stars are described. This
survey, which is designed to find and characterize sub-structures in the halo
of our Galaxy, has covered about 700 square degrees of the sky and has detected
693 RR Lyrae stars, most of which are new discoveries. The spatial distribution
of the RR Lyrae stars reveals several interesting groups in the halo. Some of
them appear to be related to previous detections of the destruction of dwarf
spheroidal galaxies (the Sagittarius tidal streams, the Virgo stellar stream,
the Monoceros ring) or globular clusters (Palomar 5), while others still have
an unknown origin.",2006-05-18T21:44:28Z
"Synchrotron emission in small scale magnetic field as possible
  explanation for prompt emission spectra of gamma-ray bursts","Synchrotron emission is believed to be a major radiation mechanism during
gamma-ray bursts' (GRBs) prompt emission phase. A significant drawback of this
assumption is that the theoretical predicted spectrum, calculated within the
framework of the ``internal shocks'' scenario using the standard assumption
that the magnetic field maintains a steady value throughout the shocked region,
leads to a slope F_\nu \propto \nu^{-1/2} below 100 keV, which is in
contradiction to the much harder spectra observed. This is due to the electrons
cooling time being much shorter than the dynamical time. In order to overcome
this problem, we propose here that the magnetic field created by the internal
shocks decays on a length scale much shorter than the comoving width of the
plasma. We show that under this assumption synchrotron radiation can reproduce
the observed prompt emission spectra of the majority of the bursts. We
calculate the required decay length of the magnetic field, and find it to be
\~10^4 - 10^5 cm (equivalent to 10^5 - 10^6 skin depths), much shorter than the
characteristic comoving width of the plasma, ~3*10^{9} cm. We implement our
model to the case of GRB050820A, where a break at <~ 4 keV was observed, and
show that this break can be explained by synchrotron self absorption. We
discuss the consequences of the small scale magnetic field scenario on current
models of magnetic field generation in shock waves.",2006-05-24T21:11:21Z
"Chandra/HETGS Observations of the Capella System: the Primary as a

HETGS) we have detected Doppler motion of Capella's X-ray emission lines in the
6 -- 25AA wave-band. The observed motion follows the expected orbital motion of
Capella's primary. This finding implies that the primary G8 III star, not the
secondary G1 III star in the Hertzsprung gap, has been the dominant source of
hot 10^{6.8} -- 10^{7}K plasma at least in the last six years. In addition, the
results demonstrate the long-term stability of the HETGS and demonstrate small
uncertainties of 25 and 33 km/s in the velocity determination with the HEG and
MEG, respectively.",2006-05-16T10:39:04Z
E+A Galaxies with Blue Cores: Active Galaxies in Transition,"HST ACS images reveal blue cores in four E+A, or post-starburst, galaxies.
Follow-up spectroscopy shows that these cores have LINER spectra. The existence
of LINERs, consistent with those in many elliptical galaxies, is yet one more
piece of evidence that these post-merger, post-starburst, bulge-dominated
galaxies will evolve into normal ellipticals. More interestingly, if LINERs are
powered by low-luminosity AGN, their presence in these E+As suggests that any
rapid growth phase of the central black hole ended in rough concert with the
cessation of star formation. This result emphasizes the importance of E+As for
exploring how the evolution of black holes and AGN may be tied to that of
galactic bulges.",2006-06-15T00:19:40Z

X-ray Spectral Study of the Photoionized Stellar Wind in Vela~X-1,"We present results from quantitative modeling and spectral analysis of the
high mass X-ray binary Vela X-1 obtained with the Chandra HETGS. The spectra
exhibit emission lines from H-like and He-like ions driven by photoionization,
as well as fluorescent emission lines from several elements in lower charge
states. In order to interpret and make full use of the high-quality data, we
have developed a simulator, which calculates the ionization and thermal
structure of a stellar wind photoionized by an X-ray source, and performs Monte
Carlo simulations of X-ray photons propagating through the wind. The emergent
spectra are then computed as a function of the viewing angle accurately
accounting for photon transport in three dimensions including dynamics. From
comparisons of the observed spectra with the simulation results, we are able to
find the ionization structure and the geometrical distribution of material in
Vela X-1 that can reproduce the observed spectral line intensities and
continuum shapes at different orbital phases remarkably well. It is found that
a large fraction of X-ray emission lines from highly ionized ions are formed in
the region between the neutron star and the companion star. We also find that
the fluorescent X-ray lines must be produced in at least three distinct regions
--(1)the extended stellar wind, (2)reflection off the stellar photosphere, and
(3)in a distribution of dense material partially covering and possibly trailing
the neutron star, which may be associated with an accretion wake. Finally, from
detailed analysis of the emission lines, we demonstrate that the stellar wind
is affected by X-ray photoionization.",2006-07-03T14:00:47Z
"Thermal evolution of the primordial clouds in warm dark matter models
  with keV sterile neutrinos","We analyze the processes relevant for star formation in a model with dark
matter in the form of sterile neutrinos. Sterile neutrino decays produce an
X-ray background radiation that has a two-fold effect on the collapsing clouds
of hydrogen. First, the X-rays ionize the gas and cause an increase in the
fraction of molecular hydrogen, which makes it easier for the gas to cool and
to form stars. Second, the same X-rays deposit a certain amount of heat, which
could, in principle, thwart the cooling of gas. We find that, in all the cases
we have examined, the overall effect of sterile dark matter is to facilitate
the cooling of gas. Hence, we conclude that dark matter in the form of sterile
neutrinos can help the early collapse of gas clouds and the subsequent star
formation.",2006-06-19T02:39:15Z
Radiative transfer in protoplanetary disks,"We present a new 3D continuum radiative transfer code, MCFOST, based on a
Monte-Carlo method. The reliability and efficiency of the code is tested by
comparison with five different radiative transfer codes previously tested by
Pascucci et al., 2004, using a 2D disk configuration. When tested against the
same disk configuration, no significant difference is found between the
temperature and SED calculated with MCFOST and with the other codes. The
computed values are well within the range of values computed by the other
codes. The code-to-code differences are small, they rarely exceed 10% and are
usually much smaller.",2006-04-04T15:51:41Z
"bHROS high spectral resolution observations of PN forbidden and
  recombination line profiles","We have acquired high spectral resolution observations (R=150,000) of the
planetary nebulae NGC 7009 and NGC 6153, using bHROS on Gemini South.
Observations of this type may provide a key to understanding why optical
recombination lines (ORLs) yield systematically higher heavy element abundances
for photoionized nebulae than do the classical forbidden collisionally excited
lines (CELs) emitted by the same ions; NGC 7009 and NGC 6153 have notably high
ORL/CEL abundance discrepancy factors (ADFs) of 5 and 10, respectively. Due to
the opposite temperature dependences of ORLs and CELs, ORLs should be
preferentially emitted by colder plasma. Our bHROS observations of NGC 7009
reveal that the [O III] 4363A CEL has a FWHM linewidth that is 1.5 times larger
than that shown by O II ORLs in the same spectrum, despite the fact that all of
these lines are emitted by the O2+ ion. The bHROS spectra of NGC 6153 also show
that its O II ORLs have significantly narrower linewidths than do the [O III]
4363A and 5007A lines but, in addition, the [O III] 4363A and 5007A lines show
very different velocity profiles, implying the presence of large temperature
variations in the nebula.",2006-05-09T14:22:00Z
Relaxation paths for single modes of vibrations in isolated molecules,"A numerical simulation of vibrational excitation of molecules was devised,
and used to excite computational models of common molecules into a prescribed,
pure, normal vibration mode in the ground electronic state, with varying,
controlable energy content. The redistribution of this energy (either
non-chaotic or irreversible IVR) within the isolated, free molecule is then
followed in time with a view to determining the coupling strength between
modes. This work was triggered by the need to predict the general characters of
the infrared spectra to be expected from molecules in interstellar space, after
being excited by photon absorption or reaction with a radical. It is found that
IVR from a pure normal mode is very ""restricted"" indeed at energy contents of
one mode quantum or so. However, as this is increased, or when the excitation
is localized, our approach allows us to isolate, describe and quantify a number
of interesting phenomena, known to chemists and in non-linear mechanics, but
difficult to demonstrate experimentally: frequency dragging, mode locking or
quenching or, still, instability near a potential surface crossing, the first
step to generalized chaos as the energy content per mode is increased.",2006-04-07T15:47:45Z
"Evidence for strong evolution of the cosmic star formation density at
  high redshift","Deep HST/ACS and VLT/ISAAC data of the GOODS-South field were used to look
for high-redshift galaxies in the rest-frame UV wavelength range and to study
the evolution of the cosmic star-formation density at z~7. The GOODS-South area
was surveyed down to a limiting magnitude of about (J+Ks)=25.5 looking for
drop-out objects in the z ACS filter. The large sampled area would allow for
the detection of galaxies which are 20 times less numerous and 1-2 magnitudes
brighter than similar studies using HST/NICMOS near-IR data. Two objects were
initially selected as promising candidates of galaxies at z~7, but have
subsequently been dismissed and identified as Galactic brown dwarfs through a
detailed analysis of their morphology and Spitzer colors, as well as through
spectroscopic information. As a consequence, we conclude that there are no
galaxies at z~7 down to our limiting magnitude in the field we investigated.
Our non detection of galaxies at z~7 provides clear evidence for a strong
evolution of the luminosity function between z=6 and z=7, i.e. over a time
interval of only ~170 Myr. Our constraints also provide evidence for a
significant decline of the total star formation rate at z=7, which must be less
than 40% of that at z=3 and 40-80% of that at z=6. We also derive an upper
limit to the ionizing flux at z=7, which is only marginally consistent with
that required to completely ionize the Universe.",2006-07-07T17:17:27Z
"Evolution of the Color-Magnitude relation in High-Redshift Clusters:
  Early-type Galaxies in the Lynx Supercluster at z~1.26","Color-magnitude relations have been derived in the clusters RX J0849+4452 and
RX J0848+4453 at z~1.26. The color-magnitude relation was determined from
Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging in the WFC F775W (i_775) and F850LP (z_850)
filters combined with ground-based spectroscopy. Early-type cluster candidates
have been identified according to the Postman et al. morphological
classification. In both clusters the bright red early-type population defines a
tight color-magnitude relation very similar in color, although the two clusters
present different X-ray luminosities and shapes, with RX J0849+4452 being three
times more X-ray luminous and more compact, and having a temperature two times
higher. The elliptical galaxy color-magnitude relations (CMR) in RX J0849+4452
and RX J0848+4453 show an intrinsic (i_775-z_850) color scatter of 0.026 +/-
0.012 mag and 0.024 +/- 0.015 mag, respectively, within 2 arcminutes (~1Mpc at
z=1.26) from the cluster X-ray emission centers. Simple modeling of the
scatters using stellar population models from Bruzual and Charlot, gives a mean
luminosity-weighted age t > 2.5 Gyr (z_f > 2.75). S0 galaxies follow the
elliptical CMR; they show larger scatters about the CMR.
  The intrinsic scatter decreases and the CMR slopes are steeper at smaller
radii, within both clusters. We conclude that old stellar populations in
cluster elliptical galaxies are already in place at z=1.26, both in the more
evolved cluster RX J0849+4452, and in its less evolved companion RX J0848+4453.
Even at a lookback time of 9 Gyr, in the early merging and buildup of massive
clusters, the bulk of the stellar content of the bright elliptical galaxy
population was in place - apparently formed some 2.5~Gyr earlier at z~3",2006-04-04T21:08:10Z
Capture Rates of Compact Objects by Supermassive Black Holes,"Capture rates of compact objects were calculated by using a recent solution
of the Fokker-Planck equation in energy-space, including two-body resonant
effects. The fraction of compact objects (white dwarfs, neutron stars and
stellar black holes) was estimated as a function of the luminosity of the
galaxy from a new grid of evolutionary models. Stellar mass densities at the
influence radius of central supermassive black holes were derived from
brightness profiles obtained by Hubble Space Telescope observations. The
present study indicates that the capture rates scale as $\propto
M_{bh}^{-1.048}$, consequence of the fact that dwarf galaxies have denser
central regions than luminous objects. If the mass distribution of supermassive
black holes has a lower cutoff at $\sim 1.4\times 10^6$ M$_{\odot}$
(corresponding to the lowest observed supermassive black hole mass, located in
M32), then 9 inspiral events are expected to be seen by LISA (7-8 corresponding
to white dwarf captures and 1-2 to neutron star and stellar black hole
captures) after one year of operation. However, if the mass distribution
extends down to $\sim 2\times 10^5$ M$_{\odot}$, then the total number of
expected events increases up to 579 (corresponding to $\sim$ 274 stellar black
hole captures, $\sim$ 194 neutron star captures and $\sim$ 111 white dwarf
captures).",2006-06-18T07:38:32Z
Bulk viscosity of spin-one color superconductors with two quark falvors,"We consider the contribution of the Urca-type processes to the bulk viscosity
of several spin-one color-superconducting phases of dense two-flavor quark
matter. In the so-called transverse phases which are suggested to be
energetically favorable at asymptotic densities, the presence of ungapped
quasiparticle modes prevents that spin-one color superconductivity has a large
effect on the bulk viscosity. When all modes are gapped, as for one particular
color-spin-locked phase, the effect on the viscosity can be quite large, which
may have important phenomenological implications.",2006-07-28T13:26:43Z
"Modelling spectral line profiles of wind-wind shock emissions from
  massive binary systems","One of the most intriguing spectral features of WR binary stars is the
presence of time-dependent line profiles. Long term observations of several
systems revealed the periodicity of this variability, synchronized with the
orbital movement. Several partially successful models have been proposed to
reproduce the observed data. The most promising assume that the origin of the
emission is the wind-wind interaction zone. In this scenario, two high velocity
and dense winds produce a strong shock layer, responsible for most of the
X-rays observed from these systems. As the secondary star moves along its
orbital path, the shock region of conical shape, changes its position with
relation to the line of sight. As a consequence, the stream measured Doppler
shift presents time variations resulting in position changes of the spectral
line. In our work, we present an alternative model, introducing turbulence in
the shock layer to account for the line broadening and opacity effects for the
asymmetry in the line profiles. We showed that the gas turbulence avoids the
need of an unnaturally large contact layer thickness to reproduce line
broadening. Also, we demonstrated that if the emission from the opposing cone
surface is absorbed, the result is a single peaked profile. This result fully
satisfies the recent data obtained from massive binary systems, and can help on
the determination of both winds and orbital parameters. We successfully applied
this model to the Br22 system and determined its orbital parameters.",2006-07-10T12:01:46Z
The Millennium Galaxy Catalogue: a census of local compact galaxies,"We use the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue (MGC) to study the effect of compact
galaxies on the local field galaxy luminosity function. Here we observationally
define as `compact' galaxies that are too small to be reliably distinguished
from stars using a standard star-galaxy separation technique. In particular, we
estimate the fraction of galaxies that are misclassified as stars due to their
compactness. We have spectroscopically identified all objects to B_MGC = 20 mag
in a 1.14 deg^2 sub-region of the MGC, regardless of morphology. From these
data we develop a model of the high surface brightness incompleteness and
estimate that ~1 per cent of galaxies with B_MGC < 20 mag are misclassified as
stars, with an upper limit of 2.3 per cent at 95 per cent confidence. However,
since the missing galaxies are preferentially sub-L* their effect on the faint
end of the luminosity function is substantially amplified: we find that they
contribute ~6 per cent to the total luminosity function in the range -17 < M_B
< -14 mag, which raises the faint end slope alpha by 0.03^{+0.02}_{-0.01}.
Their contribution to the total B-band luminosity density is ~2 per cent.
Roughly half of the missing galaxies have already been recovered through
spectroscopy of morphologically stellar targets selected mainly by colour. We
find that the missing galaxies mostly consist of intrinsically small, blue,
star-forming, sub-L* objects. In combination with the recent results of Driver
et al. (2005) we have now demonstrated that the MGC is free from both high and
low surface brightness selection bias for giant galaxies (M_B <~ -17 mag).
Dwarf galaxies, on the other hand, are significantly affected by these
selection effects. To gain a complete view of the dwarf population will require
both deeper and higher resolution surveys.",2006-04-10T17:07:15Z
MILES: A Medium resolution INT Library of Empirical Spectra,"A new stellar library developed for stellar population synthesis modeling is
presented. The library consist of 985 stars spanning a large range in
atmospheric parameters. The spectra were obtained at the 2.5m INT telescope and
cover the range 3525-7500A at 2.3A (FWHM) spectral resolution. The spectral
resolution, spectral type coverage, flux calibration accuracy and number of
stars represent a substantial improvement over previous libraries used in
population synthesis models.",2006-07-03T10:23:56Z
"Evolution of linear perturbations through a bouncing world model: Is the
  near Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum possible via a bounce?","We present a detailed numerical study of the evolutions of cosmological
linear perturbations through a simple bouncing world model based on two scalar
fields. We properly identify the relatively growing and decaying solutions in
expanding and collapsing phases. Using a decomposition based on the large-scale
limit exact solution of curvature (adiabatic) perturbations with two
independent modes, we assign the relatively growing/decaying one in an
expanding phase as the C/d-mode. In the collapsing phase, the roles are
reversed, and the C/d-mode is relatively decaying/growing. The analytic
solution shows that, as long as the large scale and the adiabatic conditions
are met, the C- and d-modes preserve their nature throughout the bounce. Here,
by using a concrete nonsingular bouncing world model based on two scalar
fields, we numerically follow the evolutions of the correctly identified C- and
d-modes which preserve their nature through the bounce, thus confirming our
previous anticipation based on the analytic solution. Thus, while the
large-scale condition is satisfied and the adiabatic condition is met during
the bounce, we conclude that it is not possible to obtain the near
Harrison-Zel'dovich scale-invariant density spectrum through a bouncing world
model as long as the seed fluctuations were generated from quantum fluctuations
of the curvature perturbation in the collapsing phase.",2006-07-20T06:13:16Z
Intergalactic CIV absorption at redshifts 5.4 to 6,"We report the discovery of a strong CIV 1548,1550 absorption system at z_abs
= 5.7238 in the near-infrared spectrum (J-band) of the z_em = 6.28 QSO SDSS
J1030+0524. These observations, obtained with the Infrared Spectrometer And
Array Camera (ISAAC) on the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope
(ESO VLT), demonstrate that, with modern instrumentation, QSO absorption line
spectroscopy can be successfully extended to near-infrared wavelengths to probe
the intergalactic medium near the end of the reionization epoch. Although the
statistics of this pilot study are limited, the mass density of triply ionized
carbon implied by our data is comparable to the values of Omega_CIV reported at
lower redshifts. Neither the column density distribution of CIV absorbers nor
its integral show significant redshift evolution over a period of time which
stretches from 1 to 4.5 Gyr after the big bang, suggesting that a large
fraction of intergalactic metals may already have been in place at redshifts
above 6. Alternatively, the strong CIV system we have detected may be
associated with outflowing, highly-ionized, gas from a foreground massive
galaxy; deep imaging and spectroscopy of galaxies near the QSO sightline should
be able to distinguish between these two possibilities.",2006-07-03T19:59:34Z
Status and Perspectives of Dark Matter Searches,"In the last year many collaborations searching for the dark matter
constituent have published results from their experiments. Here I give a review
of direct detection searches reported by the DAMA, KIMS, CDMS-II, EDELWEISS-I,

collaboration as well as the XENON10 collaboration.",2006-07-27T17:54:20Z
SPH Simulations with Reconfigurable Hardware Accelerator,"We present a novel approach to accelerate astrophysical hydrodynamical
simulations. In astrophysical many-body simulations, GRAPE (GRAvity piPE)
system has been widely used by many researchers. However, in the GRAPE systems,
its function is completely fixed because specially developed LSI is used as a
computing engine. Instead of using such LSI, we are developing a special
purpose computing system using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chips as
the computing engine. Together with our developed programming system, we have
implemented computing pipelines for the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)
method on our PROGRAPE-3 system. The SPH pipelines running on PROGRAPE-3 system
have the peak speed of 85 GFLOPS and in a realistic setup, the SPH calculation
using one PROGRAPE-3 board is 5-10 times faster than the calculation on the
host computer. Our results clearly shows for the first time that we can
accelerate the speed of the SPH simulations of a simple astrophysical phenomena
using considerable computing power offered by the hardware.",2006-04-13T10:35:15Z
A Library of Lick/IDS Indices for Binary Stellar Populations,"Using EPS we present 13 refined Lick/IDS absorption-line indices for an
extensive set of instantaneous-burst binary stellar populations (BSPs) at high
resolution (0.3 \AA) of various age and metallicity (1-15Gyr, 0.004-0.03), and
38 indices at intermediate resolution (3 \AA). These indices are obtained by
two methods: (1) obtain them by using the empirical fitting functions (FFs
method); (2) measure them directly from the synthetic spectra (DC method).
Together with our previous paper a database of Lick/IDS spectral
absorption-line indices for BSPs at high and intermediate resolutions is
provided. This set of indices includes 21 indices of Worthey et al., four
Balmer indices defined by Worthey & Ottaviani and 13 indices with the new
passband definitions of Trager et al. The full set of synthetic indices and the
integrated pseudo-continuum are listed in the Appendix, which is only available
online or from our website (http://www.ast9. com/), or on request from the
first author. Moreover, the ISEDs can be obtained from our website.
  We compare the synthetic Lick/IDS indices obtained by FFs method and those by
DC method, and find that the discrepancies are significant: Ca4455 (index 6),
Fe4668 (8), Mg_b (13), Fe5709 (17), NaD (19), TiO_1 (20) and TiO_2 (21, except
for Z=0.02) in the W94 system, Ca4455^T (6^T), C_2 4668^T (8^T), NaD^T (19^T),
TiO_1^T (20^T) and TiO_2^T (21^T, except for Z=0.02) in the T98 system obtained
by DC method are less (bluer) than the corresponding ones obtained by FFs
method for all metallicities. Ca4227 (index 3), Fe5782 (18),Ca4227^T (3^T) and
Fe5782^T (18^T) are greater at Z=0.03 and become to be bluer at Z=0.004,
Fe5709^T (17^T) index is less at Z=0.03 and becomes to be redder at Z=0.004
than the corresponding ones obtained by FFs method.",2006-05-16T04:15:51Z
Planetesimal Capture in the Disk Instability Model,"We follow the contraction and evolution of a typical Jupiter-mass clump
created by the disk instability mechanism, and compute the rate of planetesimal
capture during this evolution. We show that such a clump has a slow contraction
phase lasting ~3x10^5 years. By following the trajectories of planetesimals as
they pass through the envelope of the protoplanet, we compute the cross-section
for planetesimal capture at all stages of the protoplanet's evolution. We show
that the protoplanet can capture a large fraction of the solid material in its
feeding zone, which will lead to an enrichment of the protoplanet in heavy
elements. The exact amount of this enrichment depends upon, but is not very
sensitive to the size and random speed of the planetesimals.",2006-06-29T16:20:37Z
The milliarcsecond-scale jet of PKS 0735+178 during quiescence,"We present polarimetric 5 GHz to 43 GHz VLBI observations of the BL Lacertae
object PKS 0735+178, spanning March 1996 to May 2000. Comparison with previous
and later observations suggests that the overall kinematic and structural
properties of the jet are greatly influenced by its activity. Time intervals of
enhanced activity, as reported before 1993 and after 2000 by other studies, are
followed by highly superluminal motion along a rectilinear jet. In contrast the
less active state in which we performed our observations, shows subluminal or
slow superluminal jet features propagating through a twisted jet with two sharp
bends of about 90 deg. within the innermost three-milliarcsecond jet structure.
Proper motion estimates from the data presented here allow us to constrain the
jet viewing angle to values < 9 deg., and the bulk Lorentz factor to be between
2 and 4.",2006-04-26T11:13:42Z
The role of project science in the Chandra X-ray Observatory,"The Chandra X-ray Observatory, one of NASA's Great Observatories, has an
outstanding record of scientific and technical success. This success results
from the efforts of a team comprising NASA, its contractors, the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory, the instrument groups, and other elements of the
scientific community -- including the thousands of scientists who utilize this
powerful facility for astrophysical research. We discuss the role of NASA
Project Science in the formulation, development, calibration, and operation of
the Chandra X-ray Observatory. In addition to serving as an interface between
the scientific community and the Project, Project Science performed what we
term ""science systems engineering"". This activity encompasses translation of
science requirements into technical requirements and assessment of the
scientific impact of programmatic and technical trades. We briefly describe
several examples of science systems engineering conducted by Chandra Project
Science.",2006-06-14T19:36:47Z
"Non-existence of self-similar solutions containing a black hole in a
  universe with a stiff fluid or scalar field or quintessence","We consider the possible existence of self-similar solutions containing black
holes in a Friedmann background with a stiff fluid or a scalar field. We
carefully study the relationship between the self-similar equations in these
two cases and emphasize the crucial role of the similarity horizon. We show
that there is no self-similar black hole solution surrounded by an exact or
asymptotically flat Friedmann background containing a massless scalar field.
This result also applies for a scalar field with a potential, providing the
universe is decelerating. However, if there is a potential and the universe is
accelerating (as in the quintessence scenario), the result only applies for an
exact Friedmann background. This extends the result previously found in the
stiff fluid case and strongly suggests that accretion onto primordial black
holes is ineffective even during scalar field domination. It also contradicts
recent claims that such black holes can grow appreciably by accreting
quintessence. Appreciable growth might be possible with very special matter
fields but this requires {\it ad hoc} and probably unphysical conditions.",2006-04-11T02:20:34Z
An Extremely Curved Relativistic Jet in PKS 2136+141,"We report the discovery of an extremely curved jet in the radio-loud quasar
PKS2136+141. Multi-frequency Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) images show a
bending jet making a turn-around of 210 degrees in the plane of the sky, which
is, to our knowledge, the largest ever observed change in the position angle of
an astrophysical jet. Images taken at six different frequencies, from 2.3 to 43
GHz, reveal a spiral-like trajectory, which is likely a sign of an intrinsic
helical geometry. A space-VLBI image, taken with the HALCA satellite at 5 GHz
and having comparable resolution to our ground-based 15 GHz data, confirms that
the bend is a frequency-independent structure. VLBA monitoring data at 15 GHz,
covering eight years of observations, show knots in the jet clearly deviating
from ballistic motion, which suggests that the bending may be caused by a
growing helical Kelvin-Helmholtz normal mode. The jet appearance suggests a
helical wave at a frequency well below the ""resonant"" frequency of the jet,
which indicates that the wave is driven by a periodic perturbation at the base
of the jet. We fit the observed structure in the source with a helical twist,
and we find that a simple isothermal model with a constant wave speed and
wavelength gives a good fit. The measured apparent velocities indicate some
degree of acceleration along the jet, which together with an observed change in
the apparent half-opening angle of the jet allow us to estimate the changes in
the angle between the local jet direction and our line of sight. We suggest
that the jet in PKS2136+141 is distorted by a helical Kelvin-Helmholtz normal
mode externally driven into the jet (e.g. by precession), and that our line of
sight falls within the opening angle of the helix cone.",2006-05-04T19:55:43Z
Most Detects G- and P-Modes in the B Supergiant HD 163899 (B2Ib/II),"The {\it Microvariability and Oscillations of Stars (MOST)} satellite
observed the B supergiant HD 163899 (B2 Ib/II) for 37 days as a guide star and
detected 48 frequencies $\la$ 2.8 c d$^{-1}$ with amplitudes of a few
milli-magnitudes (mmag) and less. The frequency range embraces g- and p-mode
pulsations. It was generally thought that no g-modes are excited in less
luminous B supergiants because strong radiative damping is expected in the
core. Our theoretical models, however, show that such g-modes are excited in
massive post-main-sequence stars, in accordance with these observations. The
nonradial pulsations excited in models between $20M_\odot$ at $\log T_{\rm eff}
\approx 4.41$ and $15M_\odot$ at $\log T_{\rm eff} \approx 4.36$ are roughly
consistent with the observed frequency range. Excitation by the Fe-bump in
opacity is possible because g-modes can be partially reflected at a convective
zone associated with the hydrogen-burning shell, which significantly reduces
radiative damping in the core. The {\it MOST} light curve of HD 163899 shows
that such a reflection of g-modes actually occurs, and reveals the existence of
a previously unrecognized type of variable, slowly pulsating B supergiants
(SPBsg) distinct from $\alpha$ Cyg variables. Such g-modes have great potential
for asteroseismology.",2006-06-29T10:30:46Z
The Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH) of the AMS experiment,"The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) experiment to be installed on the
International Space Station (ISS) will be equipped with a proximity focusing
Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector for measuring the electric charge and
velocity of the charged cosmic particles. A RICH prototype consisting of 96
photomultiplier units, including a piece of the conical reflector, was built
and its performance evaluated with ion beam data. Preliminary results of the
in-beam tests performed with ion fragments resulting from collisions of a 158
GeV/c/nuc primary beam of Indium ions (CERN SPS) on a Pb target are reported.
The collected data included tests to the final front-end electronics and to
different aerogel radiators. Cherenkov rings for a large range of charged
nuclei and with reflected photons were observed. The data analysis confirms the
design goals. Charge separation up to Fe and velocity resolution of the order
of 0.1% for singly charged particles are obtained.",2006-03-31T15:53:06Z
"Solar-like oscillations in the metal-poor subgiant nu Indi: constraining
  the mass and age using asteroseismology","Asteroseismology is a powerful method for determining fundamental properties
of stars. We report the first application to a metal-poor object, namely the
subgiant star nu Ind. We measured precise velocities from two sites, allowing
us to detect oscillations and infer a large frequency separation of Delta_nu =
24.25 +/- 0.25 microHz. Combining this value with the location of the star in
the H-R diagram and comparing with standard evolutionary models, we were able
to place constraints on the stellar parameters. In particular, our results
indicate that nu Ind has a low mass (0.85 +/- 0.04 M_sun) and is at least 9 Gyr
old.",2006-04-21T03:51:44Z
Redshift distribution of gamma-ray bursts and star formation rate,"The redshift distribution of gamma-ray bursts collected in the BATSE Catalog
is compared with the star formation rate. We aim to clarify the accordance
between them. We also study the case of comoving number density of bursts
monotonously increasing up to redshift 6-20. A method independent of the models
of the gamma-ray bursts is used. The short and the long subgroups are studied
separately. The redshift distribution of the long bursts may be proportional to
the star formation rate. For the short bursts this can also happen, but the
proportionality is less evident. For the long bursts the monotonously
increasing scenario is also less probable but still can occur. For the short
bursts this alternative seems to be excluded.",2006-06-15T12:26:17Z
"Reconciling optical and X-ray mass estimates: the case of the elliptical
  galaxy NGC3379","NGC3379 is a well studied nearby elliptical for which optical investigations
have claimed a little dark matter content, or even no dark matter. Recently,
its total mass profile M(r) has been derived by exploiting Chandra observations
of its extended and X-ray emitting interstellar medium, based on the hypothesis
of hydrostatic equilibrium for the hot gas. The resulting total mass within the
effective radius Re has been claimed to be a few times larger than found by
optical studies. Here we show that part of the discrepancy can be due to an
underestimate of the optically derived mass, and the remaining discrepancy of a
factor of ~2 can be explained by deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium of the
hot gas. By using hydrodynamical simulations tailored to reproduce the observed
hot gas properties of NGC3379, and by assuming as input for the simulations the
total mass profile derived optically, we show that i) the hot gas at the
present time has X-ray properties consistent with those observed only if it is
outflowing over most of the galactic body, and ii) an overestimate of M of the
same size found in the recent X-ray analysis is recovered when assuming
hydrostatic equilibrium. We also show that the hot gas is outflowing even for a
dark matter fraction within Re as large as derived with the standard X-ray
procedure based on the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption, which shows the
unapplicability of the method for this galaxy. Finally, we find that the whole
range of dark mass amount and distribution allowed for by optical studies is
compatible with a hot gas flow with the observed X-ray properties.",2006-05-22T12:03:08Z
"The Extragalactic Lens VLBI Imaging Survey (ELVIS). I. A Search for the
  Central Image in the Gravitational Lens PMN J1838-3427","The Extragalactic Lens VLBI Imaging Survey (ELVIS) searches for central
images of lensed radio quasars, in order to measure the central density
profiles of distant galaxies. Here we present sensitive multi-epoch Very Long
Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of PMN J1838-3427 at 8 GHz, with a 1 sigma
noise level of 38 microJy beam^(-1). Based on the absence of a central image of
the background source at this level, we explore the possibilities for the
central matter distribution in the lens galaxy. A power-law density profile,
rho ~ r^(-gamma), must have gamma > 1.93. Thus the density profile is close to
an isothermal profile (gamma = 2) or steeper. The upper limit on any
constant-density core in an otherwise isothermal profile is ~< 5 parsecs. We
also derive the constraints on models in which the density profile is
isothermal on kiloparsec scales, but is allowed to have a different power law
in the central ~100 parsecs. If the lens galaxy harbors a supermassive black
hole, the galaxy profile is allowed to be shallower, but for the expected black
hole mass the galaxy profile must still be close to isothermal or steeper.",2006-05-06T03:26:57Z
Astrometry and Photometry with Coronagraphs,"We propose a solution to the problem of astrometric and photometric
calibration of coronagraphic images with a simple optical device which, in
theory, is easy to use. Our design uses the Fraunhofer approximation of Fourier
optics. Placing a periodic grid of wires (we use a square grid) with known
width and spacing in a pupil plane in front of the occulting coronagraphic
focal plane mask produces fiducial images of the obscured star at known
locations relative to the star. We also derive the intensity of these fiducial
images in the coronagraphic image. These calibrator images can be used for
precise relative astrometry, to establish companionship of other objects in the
field of view through measurement of common proper motion or common parallax,
to determine orbits, and to observe disk structure around the star
quantitatively. The calibrator spots also have known brightness, selectable by
the coronagraph designer, permitting accurate relative photometry in the
coronagraphic image. This technique, which enables precision exoplanetary
science, is relevant to future coronagraphic instruments, and is particularly
useful for `extreme' adaptive optics and space-based coronagraphy.",2006-06-07T01:41:39Z
Stellar remnants in galactic nuclei: mass segregation,"The study of how stars distribute themselves around a massive black hole
(MBH) in the center of a galaxy is an important prerequisite for the
understanding of many galactic-center processes. These include the observed
overabundance of point X-ray sources at the Galactic center, the prediction of
rates and characteristics of tidal disruptions of extended stars by the MBH and
of inspirals of compact stars into the MBH, the latter being events of high
importance for the future space borne gravitational wave interferometer LISA.
In relatively small galactic nuclei, hosting MBHs with masses in the range
10^5-10^7 Msun, the single most important dynamical process is 2-body
relaxation. It induces the formation of a steep density cusp around the MBH and
strong mass segregation, as more massive stars lose energy to lighter ones and
drift to the central regions. Using a spherical stellar dynamical Monte-Carlo
code, we simulate the long-term relaxational evolution of galactic nucleus
models with a spectrum of stellar masses. Our focus is the concentration of
stellar black holes to the immediate vicinity of the MBH. We quantify this mass
segregation for a variety of galactic nucleus models and discuss its
astrophysical implications. Special attention is given to models developed to
match the conditions in the Milky Way nucleus; we examine the presence of
compact objects in connection to recent high-resolution X-ray observations.",2006-03-11T11:43:47Z
DIOS: the Diffuse Intergalactic Oxygen Surveyor,"We present our proposal for a small X-ray mission DIOS (Diffuse Intergalactic
Oxygen Surveyor), consisting of a 4-stage X-ray telescope and an array of TES
microcalorimeters, cooled with mechanical coolers, with a total weight of about
400 kg. The mission will perform survey observations of warm-hot intergalactic
medium using OVII and OVIII emission lines, with the energy coverage up to 1.5
keV. The wide field of view of about 50' diameter, superior energy resolution
close to 2 eV FWHM, and very low background will together enable us a wide
range of science for diffuse X-ray sources. We briefly describe the design of
the satellite, performance of the subsystems and the expected results.",2006-07-07T09:35:43Z
Hamilton's Eccentricity Vector Generalised to Newton Wonders,"The vectorial velocity is given as a function of the position of a particle
in orbit when a Newtonian central force is supplemented by an inverse cubic
force as in Newton's theorem on revolving orbits. Such expressions are useful
in fitting orbits to radial velocities of orbital streams. The
Hamilton-Laplace-Runge-Lenz eccentricity vector is generalised to give a
constant of the motion for these systems and an approximate constant for orbits
in general central potentials. A related vector is found for Hooke's centred
ellipse.",2006-04-20T14:10:44Z
"Unveiling the nature of INTEGRAL objects through optical spectroscopy.
  IV. A study of six new hard X-ray sources","We present further results from our ongoing optical spectrophotometric
campaign at the Astronomical Observatory of Bologna in Loiano (Italy) on
unidentified hard X-ray sources detected by INTEGRAL. We observed
spectroscopically the putative optical counterparts of the INTEGRAL sources IGR
J00234+6141, IGR J01583+6713, IGR J06074+2205, IGR J13091+1137 and IGR
J20286+2544. We find that the first two are Galactic objects, namely a
Cataclysmic Variable at a distance of about 300 pc and a Be/X transient
High-Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) located at about 6.4 kpc, respectively, whereas
the last one is identified with MCG +04-48-002, a Starburst/HII galaxy at
redshift z = 0.013 hiding a Seyfert 2 nucleus. We identify IGR J13091+1137 as
the (likely Seyfert 2 type) active nucleus of galaxy NGC 4992, which we
classify as an X-ray Bright, Optically Normal Galaxy; this is the first example
of this type of object to be detected by INTEGRAL, and one of the closest of
this class. We moreover confirm the possible Be/X nature of IGR J06074+2205,
and we estimate it to be at a distance of about 1 kpc. We also reexamine the
spectrum of the z = 0.087 elliptical radio galaxy PKS 0352-686, the possible
counterpart of the INTEGRAL source IGR J03532-6829, and we find that it is a BL
Lac. Physical parameters for these sources are also evaluated by discussing our
findings in the context of the available multiwavelength information. These
identifications further stress the importance of INTEGRAL in the study of the
hard X-ray spectrum of Active Galactic Nuclei, HMXBs and Cataclysmic Variables.",2006-04-22T09:49:54Z
Constraining the size of the narrow line region in distant quasars,"We propose a proper method to measure the size of the narrow line region
(NLR) in distant quasars. The apparent angular size of the NLR is, in general,
too small to resolve technically. However, it is possible to map the NLR if
with gravitational lensing. In our method, we directly compare the observed
image of the NLR with the expected lensed images of the NLR for various source
sizes and lens models. Seeking the best fit image via the comparison
procedures, we can obtain the best-fit size and the best-fit lens model. We
apply this method to the two-dimensional spectroscopic data of a famous lensed
quasar, Q2237+0305. If the lens galaxy resembles the applied lens model, an
upper limit to the NLR size can be set 750 pc. Further, we examine how the
fitting results will be improved by future observations, taking into account
the realistic observational effects, such as seeing. Future observations will
provide us more stringent constraints on the size of the NLR and on the density
profile of the lens galaxy.",2006-03-29T21:14:53Z
"Rare-earth elements in the atmosphere of the magnetic chemically
  peculiar star HD 144897. New classification of the Nd III spectrum","We have obtained a UVES spectrum of a slowly rotating strongly magnetic Ap
star, HD 144897, that exhibits very large overabundances of rare-earth
elements. Here we present a detailed spectral analysis of this object, also
taking into account effects of non-uniform vertical distribution
(stratification) of chemical elements. We have determined the photospheric
abundances of 40 ions. For seven elements (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe), we have
obtained a stratification model that allow us to produce a satisfactory fit to
the observed profiles of spectral lines of various strength. REEs abundances,
that for the first time in the literature have been determined from the lines
of the first and second ions, have been found typically four dex larger than
solar abundances. Our analysis of REE spectral lines provide a strong support
to the laboratory line classification and determination of the atomic
parameters. The only remarkable exception is Nd III, for which spectral
synthesis was found to be inconsistent with the observations. We have therefore
performed a revision of the Nd III classification. We have confirmed the
energies for 11 out of 24 odd energy levels classified previously, and we have
derived the energies for additional 24 levels of Nd III, thereby increasing
substantially the number of classified Nd III lines with corrected wavelengths
and atomic parameters.",2006-04-26T16:36:43Z
Stellar Populations with ELTs,"The star formation, mass assembly and chemical enrichment histories of
galaxies, and their present distributions of dark matter, remain encoded in
their stellar populations. Distinguishing the actual distribution functions of
stellar age, metallicity and kinematics at several locations in a range of
galaxies, sampling across Hubble types and representative environments, is the
information required for a robust description of galaxy histories. Achieving
this requires large aperture, to provide the sensitivity to reach a range of
environs and Hubble types beyond the Local Group, to provide high spatial
resolution, since the fields are crowded, and preferably with optical
performance since age-sensitivity is greatest near the main-sequence turn-off,

"Structure and Stability of Phase Transition Layers in the Interstellar
  Medium","We analyze the structure and stability of the transition layer (or front)
that connects the cold neutral medium and warm neutral medium in the
plane-parallel geometry. Such fronts appear in recent numerical simulations of
a thermally bistable interstellar medium. The front becomes an evaporation or
condensation front depending on the surrounding pressure. The stability
analysis is performed in both long- and short-wavelength approximations. We
find that the plane-parallel evaporation front is unstable under corrugational
deformations, whereas the condensation front seems to be stable. The
instability is analogous to the Darrieus-Landau instability in combustion
front. The growth rate of the instability is proportional to the speed of the
evaporation flow and the corrugation wavenumber for modes with wavelength much
longer than the thickness of the front, and it is suppressed at scales
approximately equal to the thickness of the front. The timescale of the
instability is smaller than the cooling timescale of the warm neutral medium
($\sim 1$ Myr), and can be as small as the cooling timescale of the cold
neutral medium ($\sim 0.01-0.1$ Myr). Thus, this instability should be one of
the processes for driving the interstellar turbulence.",2006-04-27T11:19:25Z
"Power spectrum of the SDSS luminous red galaxies: constraints on
  cosmological parameters","In this paper we determine the constraints on cosmological parameters using
the CMB data from the WMAP experiment together with the recent power spectrum
measurement of the SDSS Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs). Specifically, we focus on
spatially flat, low matter density models with adiabatic Gaussian initial
conditions. The spatial flatness is achieved with an additional quintessence
component whose equation of state parameter w_eff is taken to be independent of
redshift. Throughout most of the paper we do not allow any massive neutrino
contribution and also the influence of the gravitational waves on the CMB is
taken to be negligible. The analysis is carried out separately for two cases:
(i) using the acoustic scale measurements as presented in H\""utsi (2006), (ii)
using the full SDSS LRG power spectrum and its covariance matrix. We are able
to obtain a very tight constraint on the Hubble constant: H_0 = 70.8
^{+2.1}_{-2.0} km/s/Mpc, which helps in breaking several degeneracies between
the parameters and allows us to determine the low redshift expansion law with
much higher accuracy than available from the WMAP + HST data alone. The
positive deceleration parameter q_0 is found to be ruled out at 5.5 \sigma
confidence level. Finally, we extend our analysis by investigating the effects
of relaxing the assumption of spatial flatness and also allow for a
contribution from massive neutrinos.",2006-04-06T10:20:18Z
"Invariant manifolds, phase correlations of chaotic orbits and the spiral
  structure of galaxies","In the presence of a strong $m=2$ component in a rotating galaxy, the phase
space structure near corotation is shaped to a large extent by the {\it
invariant manifolds} of the short period family of unstable periodic orbits
terminating at L$_1$ or L$_2$. The main effect of these manifolds is to create
robust {\it phase correlations} among a number of chaotic orbits large enough
to support a {\it spiral} density wave outside corotation. The phenomenon is
described theoretically by soliton-like solutions of a Sine-Gordon equation.
Numerical examples are given in an N-Body simulation of a barred spiral galaxy.
In these examples, we demonstrate how the projection of unstable manifolds in
configuration space reproduces essentially the entire observed bar-spiral
pattern.",2006-07-10T10:52:38Z
Eight billion years of disk galaxy evolution: no galaxy is an island,"We present a brief discussion of the evolution of disk galaxy stellar masses,
sizes, rotation velocities, and star formation rates over the last eight
billion years. Recent observations have failed to detect significant evolution
in the stellar mass Tully-Fisher relation, stellar mass-size relation, and the
stellar mass function of disk galaxies. Yet, most z<1 star formation is in
disks, and this star formation would be expected to drive a rapid growth of the
total stellar mass (and therefore mass function) of disks in the last eight
billion years. Such a build-up is not seen; instead, a rapid build-up in the
total stellar mass in non-star-forming spheroid-dominated galaxies is observed.
Large numbers of disk-dominated galaxies are systematically shutting off their
star formation and building up a spheroid (or losing a disk) in the epoch

Neutrino Coannihilation on Dark-Matter Relics?,"High-energy neutrinos may resonate with relic background neutralinos to form
short-lived sneutrinos. In some circumstances, the decay chain that leads back
to the lightest supersymmetric particle would yield few-GeV gamma rays or
charged-particle signals. Although resonant coannihilation would occur at an
appreciable rate in our galaxy, the signal in any foreseeable detector is
unobservably small.",2006-04-10T20:00:15Z
"Models of Forbidden Line Emission Profiles from Axisymmetric Stellar
  Winds","A number of strong infrared forbidden lines have been observed in several
evolved Wolf-Rayet star winds, and these are important for deriving metal
abundances and testing stellar evolution models. In addition, because these
optically thin lines form at large radius in the wind, their resolved profiles
carry an imprint of the asymptotic structure of the wind flow. This work
presents model forbidden line profile shapes formed in axisymmetric winds. It
is well-known that an optically thin emission line formed in a spherical wind
expanding at constant velocity yields a flat-topped emission profile shape.
Simulated forbidden lines are produced for a model stellar wind with an
axisymmetric density distribution that treats the latitudinal ionization
self-consistently and examines the influence of the ion stage on the profile
shape. The resulting line profiles are symmetric about line centre. Within a
given atomic species, profile shapes can vary between centrally peaked, doubly
peaked, and approximately flat-topped in appearance depending on the ion stage
(relative to the dominant ion) and viewing inclination. Although application to
Wolf-Rayet star winds is emphasized, the concepts are also relevant to other
classes of hot stars such as luminous blue variables and Be/B[e] stars.",2006-05-10T14:00:19Z
Cosmology with clusters of galaxies,"In this Chapter I review the role that galaxy clusters play as tools to
constrain cosmological parameters. I will concentrate mostly on the application
of the mass function of galaxy clusters, while other methods, such as that
based on the baryon fraction, are covered by other Chapters of the book. Since
most of the cosmological applications of galaxy clusters rely on precise
measurements of their masses, a substantial part of my Lectures concentrates on
the different methods that have been applied so far to weight galaxy clusters.
I provide in Section 2 a short introduction to the basics of cosmic structure
formation. In Section 3 I describe the Press--Schechter (PS) formalism to
derive the cosmological mass function, then discussing extensions of the PS
approach and the most recent calibrations from N--body simulations. In Section
4 I review the methods to build samples of galaxy clusters at different
wavelengths. Section 5 is devoted to the discussion of different methods to
derive cluster masses. In Section 6 I describe the cosmological constraints,
which have been obtained so far by tracing the cluster mass function with a
variety of methods. Finally, I describe in Section 7 the future perspectives
for cosmology with galaxy clusters and the challenges for clusters to keep
playing an important role in the era of precision cosmology.",2006-05-22T20:19:26Z
MEMS-based Speckle Spectrometer,"We describe a new concept for a MEMS-based active spatial filter for
astronomical spectroscopy. The goal of this device is to allow the use of a
diffraction-limited spectrometer on a seeing limited observation at improved
throughput over a comparable seeing-limited spectrometer, thus reducing the
size and cost of the spectrometer by a factor proportional to r0/D (For the
case of a 10 meter telescope this size reduction will be approximately a factor
of 25 to 50). We use a fiber-based integral field unit (IFU) that incorporates
an active MEMS mirror array to feed an astronomical spectrograph. A fast camera
is used in parallel to sense speckle images at a spatial resolution of lambda/D
and at a temporal frequency greater than that of atmospheric fluctuations. The
MEMS mirror-array is used as an active shutter to feed speckle images above a
preset intensity threshold to the spectrometer, thereby increasing the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the spectrogram. Preliminary calculations
suggests an SNR improvement of a factor of about 1.4. Computer simulations have
shown an SNR improvement of 1.1, but have not yet fully explored the parameter
space.",2006-06-07T22:45:32Z
Matched Filters for Source Detection in the Poissonian Noise Regime,"A procedure is described for estimating an optimum kernel for the detection
by convolution of signals among Poissonian noise. The technique is applied to
the detection of x-ray point sources in XMM-Newton data, and is shown to yield
an improvement in detection sensitivity of up to 60% over the sliding-box
method used in the creation of the 1XMM catalog.",2006-03-14T17:47:32Z
"Simulating Cosmic Reionization at Large Scales II: the 21-cm Emission
  Features and Statistical Signals","We present detailed predictions for the redshifted 21cm signal from the epoch
of reionization. These predictions are obtained from radiative transfer
calculations on the results of large scale (100/h Mpc), high dynamic range,
cosmological simulations. We consider several scenarios for the reionization
history, of both early and extended reionization. From the simulations we
construct and analyze a range of observational characteristics, from the global
signal, via detailed images and spectra, to statistical representations of rms
fluctuations, angular power spectra, and probability distribution functions to
characterize the non-gaussianity of the 21cm signal. (abbreviated abstract)",2006-03-19T20:49:44Z
"Post processing of differential images for direct extrasolar planet
  detection from the ground","The direct imaging from the ground of extrasolar planets has become today a
major astronomical and biological focus. This kind of imaging requires
simultaneously the use of a dedicated high performance Adaptive Optics [AO]
system and a differential imaging camera in order to cancel out the flux coming
from the star. In addition, the use of sophisticated post-processing techniques
is mandatory to achieve the ultimate detection performance required. In the
framework of the SPHERE project, we present here the development of a new
technique, based on Maximum A Posteriori [MAP] approach, able to estimate
parameters of a faint companion in the vicinity of a bright star, using the
multi-wavelength images, the AO closed-loop data as well as some knowledge on
non-common path and differential aberrations. Simulation results show a 10^-5
detectivity at 5sigma for angular separation around 15lambda/D with only two
images.",2006-06-14T11:38:20Z
Understanding Infrared Galaxy Populations: the SWIRE Legacy Survey,"We discuss spectral energy distributions, photometric redshifts, redshift
distributions, luminosity functions, source-counts and the far infrared to
optical luminosity ratio for sources in the SWIRE Legacy Survey. The spectral
energy distributions of selected SWIRE sources are modelled in terms of a
simple set of galaxy and quasar templates in the optical and near infrared, and
with a set of dust emission templates (cirrus, M82 starburst, Arp 220
starburst, and AGN dust torus) in the mid infrared. The optical data, together
with the IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 mu data, have been used to determine photometric
redshifts. For galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts there is a notable
improvement in the photometric redshift when the IRAC data are used, with a
reduction in the rms scatter from 10% in (1+z) to 5%. While further
spectroscopic data are needed to confirm this result, the prospect of
determining good photometric redshifts for the 2 million extragalactic objects
in SWIRE is excellent. The distribution of the different infrared sed types in
the L{ir}/L{opt} versus L{ir} plane, where L{ir} and L{opt} are the infrared
and optical bolometric luminosities, is discussed. Source-counts at 24, 70 and
160 mu are discussed, and luminosity functions at 3.6 and 24 mu are presented.",2006-03-27T17:42:06Z
Earth matter effects in supernova neutrinos: Optimal detector locations,"A model-independent experimental signature for flavor oscillations in the
neutrino signal from the next Galactic supernova (SN) would be the observation
of Earth matter effects. We calculate the probability for observing a Galactic
SN shadowed by the Earth as a function of the detector's geographic latitude.
This probability depends only mildly on details of the Galactic SN
distribution. A location at the North Pole would be optimal with a shadowing
probability of about 60%, but a far-northern location such as Pyhasalmi in
Finland, the proposed site for a large-volume scintillator detector, is almost
equivalent (58%). We also consider several pairs of detector locations and
calculate the probability that only one of them is shadowed, allowing a
comparison between a shadowed and a direct signal. For the South Pole combined
with Kamioka this probability is almost 75%, for the South Pole combined with
Pyhasalmi it is almost 90%. One particular scenario consists of a large-volume
scintillator detector located in Pyhasalmi to measure the geo-neutrino flux in
a continental location and another such detector in Hawaii to measure it in an
oceanic location. The probability that only one of them is shadowed exceeds 50%
whereas the probability that at least one is shadowed is about 80%. We provide
an online tool to calculate different shadowing probabilities for the one- and
two-detector cases.",2006-04-13T12:57:40Z
Constraining fundamental physics with the cosmic microwave background,"The temperature anisotropies and polarization of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) radiation provide a window back to the physics of the early
universe. They encode the nature of the initial fluctuations and so can reveal
much about the physical mechanism that led to their generation. In this
contribution we review what we have learnt so far about early-universe physics
from CMB observations, and what we hope to learn with a new generation of
high-sensitivity, polarization-capable instruments.",2006-06-22T13:05:26Z
An Internet Database of Ultraviolet Lightcurves for Seyfert Galaxies,"Using the Multimission Archives at Space Telescope (MAST), we have extracted
spectra and determined continuum light curves for 175 Seyfert Galaxies that
have been observed with the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) and the
Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). To obtain
the light curves as a function of Julian Date, we used fix bins in the object's
rest frame, and measured small regions (between 30 and 60 Angstroms) of each
spectrum's continuum flux in the range 1150 Angstroms to 3200 Angstroms. We

AEGIS20: a radio survey of the Extended Groth Strip,"We describe AEGIS20 - a radio survey of the Extended Groth Strip (EGS)
conducted with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 1.4GHz. The resulting catalog
contains 1,123 emitters and is sensitive to ultraluminous starbursts to z<=1.3,
well matched to the redshift range of the DEEP2 spectroscopic survey in this
region. We use stacking techniques to explore the uJy-level emission from a
variety of galaxy populations selected via conventional criteria - Lyman-break
galaxies (LBGs), distant red galaxies (DRGs), UV-selected galaxies and
extremely red objects (EROs) - determining their properties as a function of
color, magnitude and redshift and their extinction-free contributions to the
history of star formation. We confirm the familiar pattern that the
star-formation-rate (SFR) density, SFRD, rises by at least ~5x from z=0-1,
although we note highly discrepant UV- and radio-based SFR estimates. Our
radio-based SFRs become more difficult to interpret at z>1 where correcting for
contamination by radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) comes at the price of
rejecting luminous starbursts. Whilst stacking radio images is a useful
technique, accurate radio-based SFRs for z>>1 galaxies require precise
redshifts and extraordinarily high-fidelity radio data to identify and remove
accretion-related emission.",2006-07-12T20:04:13Z
A FIRST-APM-SDSS survey for high-redshift radio QSOs,"We selected from VLA-FIRST a sample of 94 objects starlike in SDSSS, and with
APM colour O-E>2, i.e. consistent with their being high-z QSOs. 78 candidates
were classified spectroscopically from published data (mainly SDSS) or
observations reported here. The fractions of QSOs (51/78) and z > 3 QSOs
(23/78) are comparable to those found in other photometric searches for high-z
QSOs. We confirm that O-E>2 ensures inclusion of all QSOs with 3.7 < z < 4.4.
The fraction of broad absorption line (BAL) QSOs for 2 < z < 4.4 is 27+-10 per
cent (7/26), and the estimated BAL fraction for radio loud (RL) QSOs is at
least as high as for optically selected QSOs (about 13 per cent). The high BAL
fraction and the high fraction of LoBALs in our sample are likely due to the
red colour selection. The space density of RL QSOs for 3.7 < z < 4.4, MAB (1450
A) < -26.6 and P(1.4 GHz) > 10^25.7 W Hz^(-1) is 1.7+-0.6 Gpc^(-3). Adopting a
RL fraction 13.4+-3 per cent, this corresponds to rho = 12.5+-5.6 Gpc^(-3), in
good agreement with the SDSS QSO luminosity function in Fan et al. (2001). We
note the unusual QSO FIRST 1413+4505 (z=3.11), which shows strong associated
Lyalpha absorption and an extreme observed luminosity, L about 2 x 10^(15)
solar luminosities.",2006-05-11T16:37:24Z
Optical Monitoring of BL Lacertae Object OJ 287: a 40-Day Period?,"We present the results of our optical monitoring of the BL Lacertae object OJ
287 during the first half of 2005. The source did not show large-amplitude
variations during this period and was in a relatively quiescent state. A
possible period of 40 days was derived from its light curves in three BATC
wavebands. A bluer-when-brighter chromatism was discovered, which is different
from the extremely stable color during the outburst in 1994--96. The different
color behaviors imply different variation mechanisms in the two states. We then
re-visited the optical data on OJ 287 from the OJ-94 project and found as well
a probable period of 40 days in its optical variability during the late-1994
outburst. The results suggest that two components contribute to the variability
of OJ 287 during its outburst state. The first component is the normal {\sl
blazar} variation. This component has an amplitude similar to that of the
quiescent state and also may share a similar periodicity. The second component
can be taken as a `low-frequency modulation' to the first component. It may be
induced by the interaction of the assumed binary black holes in the center of
this object. The 40-day period may be related to the helical structure of the
magnetic field at the base of the jet, or to the orbital motion close to the
central primary black hole.",2006-05-22T06:54:40Z
"Three-Dimensional Ionisation, Dust RT and Chemical Modelling of
  Planetary Nebulae","The assumption of spherical symmetry is not justified for the vast majority
of PNe. The interpretation of spatially-resolved observations cannot rely
solely on the application of 1D codes, which may yield incorrect abundances
determinations resulting in misleading conclusions. The 3D photoionisation code
MOCASSIN (Monte CAarlo SimulationS of ionised Nebulae) is designed to remedy
these shortcomings. The 3D transfer of both primary and secondary radiation is
treated self-consistently without the need of approximations. The code was
benchmarked and has been applied to the study of several PNe. The current
version includes a fully self-consistent radiative transfer treatment for dust
grains mixed within the gas, taking into account the microphysics of dust-gas
interactions within the geometry-independent Monte Carlo transfer. The new code
provides an excellent tool for the self-consistent analysis of dusty ionised
regions showing asymmetries and/or density and chemical inhomogeneities. Work
is currently in progress to incorporate the processes that dominate the thermal
balance of photo-dissociation regions (PDRs), as well as the formation and
destruction processes for all the main molecular species.",2006-05-14T13:58:29Z
Diffuse light and building history of the galaxy cluster Abell 2667,"We have searched for diffuse intracluster light in the galaxy cluster Abell
2667 (z=0.233) from HST images in three filters. We have applied to these
images an iterative multi-scale wavelet analysis and reconstruction technique,
which allows to subtract stars and galaxies from the original images. We detect
a zone of diffuse emission south west of the cluster center (DS1), and a second
faint object (ComDif), within DS1. Another diffuse source (DS2) may be
detected, at lower confidence level, north east of the center. These sources of
diffuse light contribute to 10-15% of the total visible light in the cluster.
Whether they are independent entities or are part of the very elliptical
external envelope of the central galaxy remains unclear. VLT VIMOS integral
field spectroscopy reveals a faint continuum at the positions of DS1 and ComDif
but do not allow to compute a redshift. A hierarchical substructure detection
method reveals the presence of several galaxy pairs and groups defining a
similar direction as the one drawn by the DS1-central galaxy-DS2 axis. The
analysis of archive XMM-Newton and Chandra observations shows X-ray emission
elongated in the same direction. The X-ray temperature map shows the presence
of a cool core, a broad cool zone stretching from north to south and hotter
regions towards the north east, south west and north west. This possibly
suggests shock fronts along these directions produced by infalling material.
These various data are consistent with a picture in which diffuse sources are
concentrations of tidal debris and harassed matter expelled from infalling
galaxies by tidal stripping and undergoing an accretion process onto the
central cluster galaxy; as such, they are expected to be found along the main
infall directions.",2006-05-15T15:08:57Z
Pulsation of the Lambda Bootis star HD 210111,"CONTEXT. The Lambda Bootis stars are a small spectroscopic subgroup of
Population I A-type stars and show significant underabundances of metals. Many
are Delta Scuti pulsators.
  AIMS. HD 210111 was selected for a detailed multisite pulsation study to
determine whether its pulsation properties differ from those of normal A stars.
  METHODS. 262 hours of high-precision photometry were obtained at the SAAO and
SSO observatories.
  RESULTS. 13 statistically significant pulsation frequencies were detected
with very small photometric amplitudes from 1 to 7 millimag in the visual. A
comparison with earlier 1994 measurements indicates a small increase in
amplitude. As a byproduct, one of the comparison stars, HD 210571, was
discovered to be a millimag variable with a frequency of 1.235 c/d and is
probably a new Gamma Doradus variable. The observed wide range of excited
frequencies from 12 to 30 c/d in HD 210111 can be explained with both the
single- and double-star hypothesis. HD 210111 is in a similar evolutionary
status to FG Vir, which also shows a wide range of excited frequencies with a
similar frequency spacing near 4 c/d. This is interpreted as successive radial
orders of the excited nonradial modes. In the double-star hypothesis previously
evoked for HD 210111, the low and the high frequencies originate in different
stars: here HD 210111 would resemble Theta^2 Tau.
  CONCLUSIONS. The pulsation of the Lambda Bootis star HD 210111 does not
differ from that of normal Delta Scuti stars.",2006-05-26T10:41:47Z
"Low- and Medium-Dispersion Spectropolarimetry of Nova V475 Sct (Nova
  Scuti 2003): Discovery of an Asymmetric High-Velocity Wind in a Moderately
  Fast Nova","We present low-resolution ($R\sim 90$) and medium-resolution ($R\sim 2500$)
spectropolarimetry of Nova V475 Sct with the HBS instrument, mounted on the
0.91-m telescope at the Okayama Astrophysical Observatory, and with FOCAS,
mounted on the 8.2-m Subaru telescope. We estimated the interstellar
polarization toward the nova from the steady continuum polarization components
and H$\alpha$ line emission components. After subtracting the interstellar
polarization component from the observations, we found that the H$\alpha$
emission seen on 2003 October 7 was clearly polarized. In the polarized flux
spectrum, the H$\alpha$ emission had a distinct red wing extending to $\sim
+4900$ km s$^{-1}$ and a shoulder around $+3500$ km s$^{-1}$, showing a
constant position angle of linear polarization $\theta_{\rm *}\simeq
155\arcdeg\pm 15\arcdeg$. This suggests that the nova had an asymmetric outflow
with a velocity of $v_{\rm wind}\simeq 3500$ km s$^{-1}$ or more, which is six
times higher than the expansion velocity of the ionized shell at the same
epoch. Such a high-velocity component has not previously been reported for a
nova in the `moderately fast' speed class. Our observations suggest the
occurrence of violent mass-loss activity in the nova binary system even during
the common-envelope phase. The position angle of the polarization in the
H$\alpha$ wing is in good agreement with that of the continuum polarization
found on 2003 September 26 ($p_{\rm *}\simeq 0.4$--0.6 %), which disappeared
within the following 2 d. The uniformity of the PA between the continuum
polarization and the wing polarization on October 7 suggests that the axis of
the circumstellar asymmetry remained nearly constant during the period of our
observations.",2006-04-16T11:27:45Z
"Sulphur abundances in disk stars as determined from the forbidden 10821

galactic disk, using a new optimal abundance indicator: the [SI] line at 10821
A. Similar to the optimal oxygen indicators, the [OI] lines, the [SI] line has
the virtues of being less sensitive to the assumed temperatures of the stars
investigated and of likely being less prone to non-LTE effects than other
tracers. Methods: High-resolution, near-infrared spectra of the [SI] line are
recorded using the Phoenix spectrometer on the Gemini South telescope. The
analysis is based on 1D, LTE model atmospheres using a homogeneous set of
stellar parameters. Results: The 10821 A [SI] line is suitable for an abundance
analysis of disk stars, and the sulphur abundances derived from it are
consistent with abundances derived from other tracers. We corroborate that, for
disk stars, the trend of sulphur-to-iron ratios with metallicity is similar to
that found for other alpha elements, supporting the idea of a common
nucleosynthetic origin.",2006-07-03T06:13:12Z

"The impact of meridional circulation on stellar butterfly diagrams and
  polar caps","Observations of rapidly rotating solar-like stars show a significant mixture
of opposite-polarity magnetic fields within their polar regions. To explain
these observations, models describing the surface transport of magnetic flux
demand the presence of fast meridional flows. Here, we link sub-surface and
surface magnetic flux transport simulations to investigate (i) the impact of
meridional circulations with peak velocities of <125m/s on the latitudinal
eruption pattern of magnetic flux tubes and (ii) the influence of the resulting
butterfly diagrams on polar magnetic field properties. Prior to their eruption,
magnetic flux tubes with low field strengths and initial cross sections below
about 300km experience an enhanced poleward deflection through meridional
flows. In particular flux tubes which originate between low and intermediate
latitudes within the convective overshoot region are strongly affected. This
latitude-dependent poleward deflection of erupting magnetic flux renders the
wings of stellar butterfly diagrams distinctively convex. The subsequent
evolution of the surface magnetic field shows that the increased number of
newly emerging bipoles at higher latitudes promotes the intermingling of
opposite polarities of polar magnetic fields. The associated magnetic flux
densities are about 20% higher than in the case disregarding the pre-eruptive
deflection, which eases the necessity for fast meridional flows predicted by
previous investigations. In order to reproduce the observed polar field
properties, the rate of the meridional circulation has to be on the order of
100m/s, and the latitudinal range from which magnetic flux tubes originate at
the base of the convective zone (<50degrees) must be larger than in the solar
case (<35degrees).",2006-04-05T16:34:49Z
"An asymptotic decrease of (m_p/m_e) with cosmological time, from a

of the proton mass to the electron mass, over a characteristic time interval
estimated here to be about a billion years, is related to the decrease with
time of a small, effective vacuum expectation value for a Goldstone-like
pseudoscalar field which is present in the early universe, and is related to
the scalar inflaton field. The same vacuum expectation value controls the
magnitude of a very small, residual vacuum energy density today, which has also
slowly decreased. The present time variation is estimated to be near to a
definite limit, that is asymptotically approached as t->oo.",2006-06-09T13:38:20Z
"A correlation between the heavy element content of transiting extrasolar
  planets and the metallicity of their parent stars","Nine extrasolar planets with masses between 110 and 430M are known to transit
their star. The knowledge of their masses and radii allows an estimate of their
composition, but uncertainties on equations of state, opacities and possible
missing energy sources imply that only inaccurate constraints can be derived
when considering each planet separately. Aims: We seek to better understand the
composition of transiting extrasolar planets by considering them as an
ensemble, and by comparing the obtained planetary properties to that of the
parent stars. Methods: We use evolution models and constraints on the stellar
ages to derive the mass of heavy elements present in the planets. Possible
additional energy sources like tidal dissipation due to an inclined orbit or to
downward kinetic energy transport are considered. Results: We show that the
nine transiting planets discovered so far belong to a quite homogeneous
ensemble that is characterized by a mass of heavy elements that is a relatively
steep function of the stellar metallicity, from less than 20 earth masses of
heavy elements around solar composition stars, to up to 100M for three times
the solar metallicity (the precise values being model-dependant). The
correlation is still to be ascertained however. Statistical tests imply a
worst-case 1/3 probability of a false positive. Conclusions: Together with the
observed lack of giant planets in close orbits around metal-poor stars, these
results appear to imply that heavy elements play a key role in the formation of
close-in giant planets. The large masses of heavy elements inferred for planets
orbiting metal rich stars was not anticipated by planet formation models and
shows the need for alternative theories including migration and subsequent
collection of planetesimals.",2006-05-31T18:14:57Z
Planetesimal Capture in the Disk Instability Model,"We follow the contraction and evolution of a typical Jupiter-mass clump
created by the disk instability mechanism, and compute the rate of planetesimal
capture during this evolution. We show that such a clump has a slow contraction
phase lasting ~3x10^5 years. By following the trajectories of planetesimals as
they pass through the envelope of the protoplanet, we compute the cross-section
for planetesimal capture at all stages of the protoplanet's evolution. We show
that the protoplanet can capture a large fraction of the solid material in its
feeding zone, which will lead to an enrichment of the protoplanet in heavy
elements. The exact amount of this enrichment depends upon, but is not very
sensitive to the size and random speed of the planetesimals.",2006-06-29T16:20:37Z
Dynamical PN Evolution with Magnetic Fields,"Hydrodynamical simulations played an important role in understanding the
dynamics and shaping of planetary nebulae in the past century. However,
hydrodynamical simulations were just a first order approach. The new millennium
arrived with the generalized understanding that the effects of magnetic fields
were necessary to study the dynamics of planetary nebulae. Thus, B-fields
introduced a whole new number of physical possibilities for the modeling. In
this paper, we review observational works done in the last 5 years and several
works on magnetohydrodynamics about proto-planetary nebulae, since all the
effort has been focused on that stage, and discuss different scenarios for the
origin of magnetized winds, and the relation binary-bipolararity.",2006-06-26T18:43:07Z
"Warm Dust and Spatially Variable PAH Emission in the Dwarf Starburst
  Galaxy NGC 1705","We present Spitzer observations of the dwarf starburst galaxy NGC 1705
obtained as part of SINGS. The galaxy morphology is very different shortward
and longward of ~5 microns: short-wavelength imaging shows an underlying red
stellar population, with the central super star cluster (SSC) dominating the
luminosity; longer-wavelength data reveals warm dust emission arising from two
off-nuclear regions offset by ~250 pc from the SSC. These regions show little
extinction at optical wavelengths. The galaxy has a relatively low global dust
mass (~2E5 solar masses, implying a global dust-to-gas mass ratio ~2--4 times
lower than the Milky Way average). The off-nuclear dust emission appears to be
powered by photons from the same stellar population responsible for the
excitation of the observed H Alpha emission; these photons are unassociated
with the SSC (though a contribution from embedded sources to the IR luminosity
of the off-nuclear regions cannot be ruled out). Low-resolution IRS
spectroscopy shows moderate-strength PAH emission in the 11.3 micron band in
the eastern peak; no PAH emission is detected in the SSC or the western dust
emission complex. There is significant diffuse 8 micron emission after scaling
and subtracting shorter wavelength data; the spatially variable PAH emission
strengths revealed by the IRS data suggest caution in the interpretation of
diffuse 8 micron emission as arising from PAH carriers alone. The metallicity
of NGC 1705 falls at the transition level of 35% solar found by Engelbracht and
collaborators; the fact that a system at this metallicity shows spatially
variable PAH emission demonstrates the complexity of interpreting diffuse 8
micron emission. A radio continuum non-detection, NGC 1705 deviates
significantly from the canonical far-IR vs. radio correlation. (Abridged)",2006-04-28T11:18:25Z
Binary central stars of planetary nebula,"Only a handful of binary central stars of planetary nebulae (PNe) are known
today, due to the difficulty of detecting their companions. Preliminary results
from radial velocity surveys, however, seem to indicate that binarity plays a
fundamental,rather than marginal role in the evolution of PNe and that the
close binary fraction might be much larger than the currently known value of
10-15%. In this review, we list all the known binary central stars, giving an
updated census of their numbers and selected characteristics. A review is also
given of the techniques used to detect binaries as well as selected
characteristics of related stellar classes which might provide constraints (or
additional puzzles) to the theory of PN evolution. Finally, we will formulate
the conjecture that all PNe derive from binary interactions and suggest that
this is not inconsistent with our current knowledge.",2006-05-24T13:50:06Z
The infrared counterpart to the magnetar 1RXS J170849.0-400910,"We have analyzed both archival and new infrared imaging observations of the
field of the Anomalous X-ray Pulsar 1RXS J170849.0-400910, in search of the
infrared counterpart. This field has been previously investigated, and one of
the sources consistent with the position of the AXP suggested as the
counterpart. We, however, find that this object is more likely a background
star, while another object within the positional error circle has non-stellar
colors and shows evidence for variability. These two pieces of evidence, along
with a consistency argument for the X-ray-to-infrared flux ratio, point to the
second source being the more likely infrared counterpart to the AXP.",2006-05-12T20:12:18Z
The HII Region of a Primordial Star,"The concordance model of cosmology and structure formation predicts the
formation of isolated very massive stars at high redshifts in dark matter
dominated halos of 10^5 to 10^6 Msun. These stars photo-ionize their host
primordial molecular clouds, expelling all the baryons from their halos. When
the stars die, a relic HII region is formed within which large amounts of
molecular hydrogen form which will allow the gas to cool efficiently when
gravity assembles it into larger dark matter halos. The filaments surrounding
the first star hosting halo are largely shielded and provide the pathway for
gas to stream into the halo when the star has died. We present the first fully
three dimensional cosmological radiation hydrodynamical simulations that follow
all these effects. A novel adaptive ray casting technique incorporates the time
dependent radiative transfer around point sources. This approach is fast enough
so that radiation transport, kinetic rate equations, and hydrodynamics are
solved self-consistently. It retains the time derivative of the transfer
equation and is explicitly photon conserving. This method is integrated with
the cosmological adaptive mesh refinement code enzo, and runs on distributed
and shared memory parallel architectures. Where applicable the three
dimensional calculation not only confirm expectations from earlier one
dimensional results but also illustrate the multi-fold hydrodynamic
complexities of HII regions. In the absence of stellar winds the circumstellar
environments of the first supernovae and putative early gamma-ray bursts will
be of low density ~1 cm^-3. Albeit marginally resolved, ionization front
instabilities lead to cometary and elephant trunk like small scale structures
reminiscent of nearby star forming regions.",2006-06-01T05:47:59Z
Filling the Infrared Gap: ISO Observations of 1 Jy BL Lacertae Objects,"The large majority of BL Lacertae objects belonging to the 1 Jy sample, the
class prototype for radio-selected sources, are thought to emit most of their
synchrotron power in the far IR band. Ironically, this spectral region is very
sparsely sampled, with only a minority of the objects having IRAS data (most of
them being upper limits or low-quality detections). We aim at filling this IR
gap by presenting new, simultaneous ISOCAM and ISOPHOT observations over the 7
- 200 micron range for half the sample. A measurement of the position of the
synchrotron peak frequency, nu_peak, can provide information about particle
acceleration mechanisms and constrain the inverse Compton radiation that will
be detected by up-coming new gamma-ray missions. We have observed 17 1 Jy BL
Lacertae objects with the camera and the photometer on board the Infrared Space
Observatory (ISO) satellite. The ISOPHOT data reduction was done employing a
novel correction, which mitigates the effect of chopping for faint sources.
Using our new ISO data, complemented by nearly-simultaneous radio and optical
observations for 10 and 4 objects respectively, and other multi-frequency data,
we have built the spectral energy distributions of our sources (plus a
previously published one) and derived the rest-frame nu_peak. Its distribution
is centered at 10^13 Hz (30 micron) and is very narrow, with 60% of the BL Lacs
in the 1 - 3 10^13 Hz range. Given our set of simultaneous infrared data, these
represent the best determinations available of the synchrotron peak frequencies
for low-energy peaked BL Lacs. A comparison with previous such estimates, based
on non-simultaneous optical and near IR data, may indicate strong nu_peak
variations in a number of sources, possibly associated with large flares as
observed in the high-energy peaked BL Lac MKN 501. (abridged)",2006-06-09T07:07:36Z
"An updated survey of globular clusters in M 31. I. Classification and
  radial velocity for 76 candidate clusters","Aims - We present the first results of a large spectroscopic survey of
globular clusters and candidate globular clusters in the nearby M~31 galaxy.
The survey is aimed at the classification of known candidate M~31 clusters and
at the study of their kinematic properties. Methods - We obtained
low-resolution spectroscopy (lambda/Dlambda~800-1300) for 133 targets,
including 76 yet-to-confirm candidate clusters (i.e. with no previous
spectroscopic information), 55 already-confirmed genuine M31 clusters, and 2
uncertain candidates. Our observations allowed a reliable estimate of the
target radial velocity, within a typical accuracy of ~+-20km/s. The observed
candidates have been robustly classified according to their radial velocity and
shape parameters that allowed us to confidently discriminate between point
sources and extended objects even from low-spatial-resolution imagery. Results
- In our set of 76 candidates clusters we found: 42 newly-confirmed bona-fide
M~31 clusters, 12 background galaxies, 17 foreground Galactic stars, 2 HII
regions belonging to M31 and 3 unclassified (possibly M31 clusters or
foreground stars) objects. The classification of a few other candidates not
included in our survey has been also reassessed on various observational bases.
All the sources of radial velocity estimates for M31 known globular clusters
available in the literature have been compared and checked, and a homogeneous
general list has been obtained for 349 confirmed clusters with radial velocity.
Conclusions - Our results suggest that a significant number of genuine clusters
(~> 100) is still hidden among the plethora of known candidates proposed by
various authors. Hence our knowledge of the globular cluster system of the M31
galaxy is still far from complete even in terms of simple membership.",2006-05-30T14:34:19Z
AL 3 (BH 261): a new globular cluster in the Galaxy,"AL~3 (BH 261), previously classified as a faint open cluster candidate, is
shown to be a new globular cluster in the Milky Way, by means of B, V and I
Color-Magnitude Diagrams. The main feature of AL~3 is a prominent blue extended
Horizontal Branch. Its Color-Magnitude Diagrams match those of the intermediate
metallicity cluster M~5. The cluster is projected in a rich bulge field, also
contaminated by the disk main sequence. The globular cluster is located in the
Galactic bulge at a distance from the Sun d$_{\odot}$ = 6.0$\pm$0.5 kpc. The
reddening is E(B-V)=0.36$\pm$0.03 and the metallicity is estimated to be [Fe/H]
$\approx$ -1.3$\pm$0.25. AL~3 is probably one of the least massive globular
clusters of the Galaxy.",2006-06-29T12:33:57Z
Report on the CoRoT Evolution and Seismic Tools Activity,"We present the work undertaken by the Evolution and Seismic Tools Activity
(ESTA) team of the CoRoT Seismology Working Group. We have focused on two main
tasks: Task 1 - now finished - has aimed at testing, comparing and optimising
seven stellar evolution codes which will be used to model the internal
structure and evolution of the CoRoT target stars. Task 2, still underway, aims
at testing, comparing and optimising different seismic codes used to calculate
the oscillations of models for different types of stars. The results already
obtained are quite satisfactory, showing minor differences between the
different numerical tools provided the same assumptions on the physical
parameters are made. This work gives us confidence on the numerical tools that
will be available to interpret the future CoRoT seismic data.",2006-05-27T19:56:38Z
"Modelling Chromospheric Line Profiles in NGC2808: Evidence of Mass Loss
  from RGB Stars","In this study we test the possibility that the asymmetry in the profiles of
the H-alpha and Ca II K lines in red giant stars is due to the presence of an
active chromosphere rather than to mass loss. To this end, we compare line
profiles computed using relevant model chromospheres to profiles of the H-alpha
and Ca II K lines observed in five red giant stars of the globular cluster NGC
2808. The spectra were taken with FLAMES during Science Verification, using the
UVES mode at high resolution (R=43,000) for the H-alpha line, and GIRAFFE in
MEDUSA mode (R=20,000) for the Ca II K line. We find that the observed profiles
are better described if a negative (outward) velocity field is included in the
model chromospheres. This leads to mass loss rates of a few 10**(-9) solar
masses per year, very close to the requirements of the stellar evolution
theory.",2006-03-24T12:57:47Z
Dark Energy in an Astrophysical Context,"We explore local consequences of a non-zero cosmological constant on
astrophysical structures. We find that the effects are not only sensitive to
the density of the configurations but also to the geometry. For non-homogeneous
configurations, we calculate the effects for a polytropic configurations and
the isothermal sphere. Special emphasis is put on the fact that the
cosmological constant sets certain scales of length, time, mass and density.
Sizable effects are established for non spherical systems such as elliptical
galaxy clusters where the effects of $\Lambda$ are growing with the flatness of
the system. The equilibrium of rotating ellipsoids is modified and the
cosmological constant allows new configurations of equilibrium.",2006-03-22T23:01:29Z
The Environments around Long-Duration Gamma-Ray Burst Progenitors,"Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow observations have allowed us to significantly
constrain the engines producing these energetic explosions. Te redshift and
position information provided by these afterglows have already allowed us to
limit the progenitors of GRBs to only a few models. The afterglows may also
provide another observation that can place further constraints on the GRB
progenitor: measurements telling us about the environments surrounding GRBs.
Current analyses of GRB afterglows suggest that roughly half of long-duration
gamma-ray bursts occur in surroundings with density profiles that are uniform.
We study the constraints placed by this observation on both the classic
``collapsar'' massive star progenitor and its relative, the ``helium-merger''
progenitor. We study several aspects of wind mass-loss and find that our
modifications to the standard Wolf-Rayet mass-loss paradigm are not sufficient
to produce constant density profiles. Although this does not rule out the
standard ``collapsar'' progenitor, it does suggest a deficiency with this
model. We then focus on the He-merger models and find that such progenitors can
fit this particular constraint well. We show how detailed observations can not
only determine the correct progenitor for GRBs, but also allow us to study
binary evolution physics.",2006-04-20T14:32:05Z
Clio: a 3-5 micron AO planet-finding camera,"Clio is an adaptive-optics camera mounted on the 6.5 meter MMT optimized for
diffraction-limited L' and M-band imaging over a ~15'' field. The instrument
was designed from the ground up with a large well-depth, fast readout thermal
infrared (~3-5 micron) 320 by 256 pixel InSb detector, cooled optics, and
associated focal plane and pupil masks (with the option for a coronograph) to
minimize the thermal background and maximize throughput. When coupled with the
MMT's adaptive secondary AO (two warm reflections) system's low thermal
background, this instrument is in a unique position to image nearby warm
planets, which are the brightest in the L' and M-band atmospheric windows. We
present the current status of this recently commissioned instrument that
performed exceptionally during first light. Our instrument sensitivities are
impressive and are sky background limited: for an hour of integration, we
obtain an L'-band 5 sigma detection limit of of 17.0 magnitudes (Strehl ~80%)
and an M-band limit of 14.5 (Strehl ~90%). Our M-band sensitivity is lower due
to the increase in thermal sky background. These sensitivities translate to
finding relatively young planets five times Jupiter mass at 10 pc within a few
AU of a star. Presently, a large Clio survey of nearby stellar systems is
underway including a search for planets around solar-type stars, M dwarfs, and
white dwarfs. Even with a null result, we can place strong constraints on
planet distribution models.",2006-06-06T21:43:43Z
"Anisotropic Galactic Outflows and Enrichment of the Intergalactic
  Medium. I: Monte Carlo Simulations","We have developed an analytical model to describe the evolution of
anisotropic galactic outflows. With it, we investigate the impact of varying
opening angle on galaxy formation and the evolution of the IGM. We have
implemented this model in a Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate galaxy formation
and outflows in a cosmological context. Using this algorithm, we have simulated
the evolution of a comoving volume of size [12h^(-1)Mpc]^3 in the LCDM
universe. Starting from a Gaussian density field at redshift z=24, we follow
the formation of ~20,000 galaxies, and simulate the galactic outflows produced
by these galaxies. When these outflows collide with density peaks, ram pressure
stripping of the gas inside the peak may result. This occurs in around half the
cases and prevents the formation of galaxies. Anisotropic outflows follow the
path of least resistance, and thus travel preferentially into low-density
regions, away from cosmological structures (filaments and pancakes) where
galaxies form. As a result, the number of collisions is reduced, leading to the
formation of a larger number of galaxies. Anisotropic outflows can
significantly enrich low-density systems with metals. Conversely, the
cross-pollution in metals of objects located in a common cosmological
structure, like a filament, is significantly reduced. Highly anisotropic
outflows can travel across cosmological voids and deposit metals in other,
unrelated cosmological structures.",2006-06-17T15:42:41Z
"Subarcsecond Resolution Mid-Infrared Observations of Super Star Clusters
  in the Antennae (NGC4038/4039)","In this letter we present ground-based subarcsecond mid-infrared imaging and
spectroscopy of young super star clusters in the overlap region of the merging
galaxies NGC4038/4039 (the Antennae) obtained with the VLT Imager and
Spectrometer for mid-Infrared (VISIR). With its unprecedented spatial
resolution VISIR begins to resolve the HII/PDR complexes around the
star-forming regions for the first time. In the N-band spectra of two young
star clusters unexpectedly low polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission
is observed, compared to what is seen with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO)
and with the Spitzer Space Telescope. We conclude that a large fraction of the
PAH emission cannot directly be associated with the super star clusters, but
originate from an extended region of at least 215 pc radius around the
clusters. In the distribution of [NeII] 12.81 micron emission a highly obscured
cluster is discovered that does not have an optical or near-infrared
counterpart.",2006-07-07T11:28:23Z
"Resolving the Dusty Circumstellar Structure of the Enigmatic Symbiotic
  Star CH Cygni with the MMT Adaptive Optics System","We imaged the symbiotic star CH Cyg and two PSF calibration stars using the
unique 6.5m MMT deformable secondary adaptive optics system. Our
high-resolution (FWHM=0.3""), very high Strehl (98%+-2%) mid-infrared (9.8 and
11.7 um) images of CH Cyg allow us to probe finer length scales than ever
before for this object. CH Cyg is significantly extended compared to our
unresolved PSF calibration stars (Mu UMa and Alpha Her) at 9.8 and 11.7 um. We
estimated the size of the extension by convolving a number of simple Gaussian
models with the Mu UMa PSF and determining which model provided the best fit to
the data. Adopting the Hipparcos distance for this object of 270 pc, we found a
nearly Gaussian extension with a FWHM at 9.8 um of ~40.5+-2.7 AU (0.15+-0.01"")
and a FWHM at 11.7 um of 45.9+-2.7 AU (0.17+-0.01""). After subtracting out the
Gaussian component of the emission (convolved with our PSF), we found a faint
\~0.7"" asymmetric extension which peaks in flux ~0.5"" north of the stars. This
extension is roughly coincident with the northern knotlike feature seen in HST
WFPC2 images obtained in 1999.",2006-04-14T20:52:02Z
Coronal emission from the shocked circumstellar ring of SN 1987A,"High resolution spectra with UVES/VLT of SN 1987A from December 2000 until
November 2005 show a number of high ionization lines from gas with velocities
of roughly 350 km/s, emerging from the shocked gas formed by the ejecta-ring
collision. These include coronal lines from [Fe X], [Fe XI] and [Fe XIV] which
have increased by a factor of about 20 during the observed period. The
evolution of the lines is similar to that of the soft X-rays, indicating that
they arise in the same component. The line ratios are consistent with those
expected from radiative shocks with velocity 310-390 km/s, corresponding to a
shock temperature of (1.6-2.5) x 10^6 K. A fraction of the coronal emission
may, however, originate in higher velocity adiabatic shocks.",2006-03-30T10:24:59Z
The X-ray properties of the dwarf Magellanic-type galaxy NGC 55,"We present an analysis of the X-ray properties of the Magellanic-type galaxy
NGC 55 based on two contiguous XMM-Newton observations. We detect a total of
137 X-ray sources in the field of view, 42 of which are located within the
optical confines of the galaxy. On the basis of X-ray colour classification and
after correcting for background objects, we conclude that our source sample
includes ~ 20 X-ray binaries, 5 supernova remnants and 7 very soft sources
(including 2 good candidate supersoft sources) associated with NGC 55. Detailed
spectral and timing analysis was carried out on 4 of the brightest X-ray
sources. One of these objects is identified with a Galactic foreground star and
is a possible new RS CVn system. The other three are consistent with accreting
X-ray binaries, though further evidence of short term variability is required
to confirm this. We also find evidence of an underlying component, which is
concentrated on the bar region but has an extent of at least 6' (3 kpc) in the
plane of the galaxy and +/- 1' (+/- 500 pc) perpendicular to it. This emission
is best fitted by a thermal plasma plus power-law model but with high intrinsic
absorption consistent with its location in the central disc of the galaxy. We
interpret the soft component as diffuse thermal emission linked to regions of
current star formation, whilst the hard power-law component may originate in
unresolved X-ray binary sources. The intrinsic luminosity of this residual disc
emission may exceed Lx ~ 6e38 ergs/s (0.3-6 keV). A comparison with other
Magellanic systems confirms that, in terms of both its discrete X-ray source
population and its extended emission, NGC 55 has X-ray properties which are
typical of its class.",2006-04-27T23:13:40Z
Testing Relativity at High Energies Using Spaceborne Detectors,"(ABRIDGED) The Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) will measure the
spectra of distant extragalactic sources of high energy gamma-rays. GLAST can
look for energy dependent propagation effects from such sources as a signal of
Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). Such sources should also exhibit high
energy spectral cutoffs from pair production interactions with low energy
photons. The properties of such cutoffs can also be used to test LIV. Detectors
to measure gamma-ray polarization can look for the depolarizing effect of
space-time birefingence predicted by loop quantum gravity. A spaceborne
detector array looking down on Earth to study extensive air showers produced by
ultrahigh energy cosmic rays can study their spectral properties and look for a
possible deviation from the predicted GZK effect as another signal of LIV.",2006-06-27T13:26:21Z
"Absorption of Nuclear Gamma-rays on the Starlight Radiation in FR I
  Sources: the Case of Centaurus A","Several BL Lac objects are confirmed sources of variable and strongly
Doppler-boosted TeV emission produced in the nuclear portions of their
relativistic jets. It is more than probable, that also many of the FR I radio
galaxies, believed to be the parent population of BL Lacs, are TeV sources, for
which Doppler-hidden nuclear gamma-ray radiation may be only too weak to be
directly observed. Here we show, however, that about one percent of the total
time-averaged TeV radiation produced by the active nuclei of low-power FR I
radio sources is inevitably absorbed and re-processed by photon-photon
annihilation on the starlight photon field, and the following emission of the
created and quickly isotropized electron-positron pairs. In the case of the
radio galaxy Centaurus A, we found that the discussed mechanism can give a
distinctive observable feature in the form of an isotropic gamma-ray halo. It
results from the electron-positron pairs injected to the interstellar medium of
the inner parts of the elliptical host by the absorption process, and
upscattering starlight radiation via the inverse-Compton process mainly to the
GeV-TeV photon energy range. Such a galactic gamma-ray halo is expected to
possess a characteristic spectrum peaking at ~0.1 TeV photon energies, and the
photon flux strong enough to be detected by modern Cherenkov Telescopes and, in
the future, by GLAST. These findings should apply as well to the other nearby
FR I sources.",2006-05-30T15:08:03Z
GaBoDS: The Garching-Bonn Deep Survey: VI. Cosmic shear analysis,"Aims. We present a cosmic shear analysis and data validation of 15 square
degree high-quality R-band data of the Garching-Bonn Deep Survey obtained with
the Wide Field Imager of the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope. Methods. We measure the
two-point shear correlation functions to calculate the aperture mass
dispersion. Both statistics are used to perform the data quality control.
Combining the cosmic shear signal with a photometric redshift distribution of a
galaxy sub-sample obtained from two square degree of UBVRI-band observations of
the Deep Public Survey we determine constraints for the matter density Omega_m,
the mass power spectrum normalisation sigma_8 and the dark energy density
Omega_Lambda in the magnitude interval R in [21.5,24.5]. In this magnitude
interval the effective number density of source galaxies is n=12.5/sq. arcmin,
and their mean redshift is z_m=0.78. To estimate the posterior likelihood we
employ the Monte Carlo Markov Chain method. Results. Using the aperture mass
dispersion we obtain for the mass power spectrum normalisation sigma_8=0.80 +-
0.10 (1 sigma statistical error) at a fixed matter density Omega_m=0.30

the Hubble parameter and the uncertainties in the fitted redshift distribution.",2006-06-23T13:23:02Z
"Expressing the equation of state parameter in terms of the three
  dimensional cosmic shear","We study the functional dependence of the spin-weighted angular moments of
the two-point correlation function of the three dimensional cosmic shear on the
expansion history of the universe. We first express the redshift dependent
total equation of state parameter in terms of the growing mode of the gauge
invariant metric perturbation in the conformal-Newtonian gauge for the case of
adiabatic perturbations. We then express the redshift dependent angular moments
of the shear two-point correlation function as an integral in terms of the
metric perturbation. We present the final explicit expression for the case of a
Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum of primordial perturbations. Our analysis is
restricted to the linear regime. We use our results to make a preliminary study
of the required sensitivity that will allow cosmic shear observations to add
significant information about the expansion history of the universe.",2006-07-19T07:32:41Z
PVLAS Experiment: Some Astrophysical Consequences,"The birefringent effects of photon-pseudoscalar boson (Goldstone) particle
mixing in intergalactic magnetic field are calculated for cosmological objects.
We use the recent results of PVLAS collaboration that reported recently the
observation of a rotation of the polarization plane of light propagating
through a transverse static magnetic field. Such results which were
interpretated as arising due to conversion of photon into pseudoscalar with
coupling strength $g_{a\gamma}\sim 4\times 10^{-6} GeV^{-1}$ allows us to
estimate the intergalactic magnetic field magnitude as $\sim 10^{-16} G$ based
on Hatsemekers et al. observations of extreme-scale alignments of quasar
polarization vectors. We have analyzed some additional results of astronomical
observations that could be explained by axion interpretation of the PVLAS data:
a sharp steepening of the QSO continuum short ward of $\simeq 1100$\AA,
observed circular polarization of AGNs and QSOs, discrepancy between observed
intrinsic polarization of stars in the Local Bubble and stellar spectral
classification. The observed polarization of stars in the Local Bubble can't be
explained by interstellar origin.",2006-07-13T11:33:27Z
Quark matter imprint on Gravitational Waves from oscillating stars,"We discuss the possibility that the detection of gravitational waves emitted
by compact stars may allow to constrain the MIT bag model of quark matter
equation of state. Our results show that the combined knowledge of the
frequency of the emitted gravitational wave and of the mass, or the radiation
radius, of the source allows one to discriminate between strange stars and
neutron stars and set stringent bounds on the bag constants.",2006-03-17T11:57:27Z
Star formation through gravitational collapse and competitive accretion,"Competitive accretion, a process to explain the origin of the IMF, occurs
when stars in a common gravitational potential accrete from a distributed
gaseous component. We show that concerns recently raised on the efficiency of
competitive accretion are incorrect as they use globally averaged properties
which are inappropriate for the detailed physics of a forming stellar cluster.
A full treatment requires a realistic treatment of the cluster potential, the
distribution of turbulent velocities and gas densities. Accreting gas does not
travel at the global virial velocity of the system due to the
velocity-sizescale relation inherent in turbulent gas and due to the lower
velocity dispersion of small-N clusters in which much of the accretion occurs.
Stars located in the gas-rich centres of such systems initially accrete from
low relative velocity gas attaining larger masses before needing to accrete the
higher velocity gas. Stars not in the centres of such potentials, or that enter
the cluster later when the velocity dispersion is higher, do not accrete
significantly and thus retain their low-masses. In competitive accretion, most
stars do not continue to accrete significantly such that their masses are set
from the fragmentation process. It is the few stars which continue to accrete
that become higher-mass stars. Competitive accretion is therefore likely to be
responsible for the formation of higher-mass stars and can explain the mass
distribution, mass segregation and binary frequency of these stars. Global
kinematics of competitive accretion models include large-scale mass infall,
with mean inflow velocities of order 0.5 km/s at scales of 0.5 pc, but infall
signatures are likely to be confused by the large tangential velocities and the
velocity dispersion present.",2006-04-28T16:41:38Z
"Galaxy pairs in cosmological simulations: effects of interactions on
  colours and chemical abundances","We perform an statistical analysis of galaxies in pairs in a Lambda-CDM
scenario by using the chemical GADGET-2 of Scannapieco et al. (2005) in order
to study the effects of galaxy interactions on colours and metallicities. We
find that galaxy-galaxy interactions can produce a bimodal colour distribution
with galaxies with significant recent star formation activity contributing
mainly to blue colours. In the simulations, the colours and the fractions of
recently formed stars of galaxies in pairs depend on environment more strongly
than those of galaxies without a close companion, suggesting that interactions
play an important role in galaxy evolution. If the metallicity of the stellar
populations is used as the chemical indicator, we find that the simulated
galaxies determine luminosity-metallicity and stellar mass-metallicity
relations which do not depend on the presence of a close companion. However, in
the case of the luminosity-metallicity relation, at a given level of
enrichment, we detect a systematic displacement of the relation to brighter
magnitudes for active star forming systems. Regardless of relative distance and
current level of star formation activity, galaxies in pairs have stellar
populations with higher level of enrichment than galaxies without a close
companion. In the case of the gas component, this is no longer valid for
galaxies in pairs with passive star formation which only show an excess of
metals for very close pair members, consequence of an important recent past
star formation activity. (Abridged).",2006-05-04T17:56:24Z
Mid-Infrared Spectral Diagnostics of Nearby Galaxies,"The Spitzer Space Telescope is pushing into new frontiers in high redshift
astronomy. Closer to home, Spitzer is making an equally large impact on our
understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. In this contribution we
present mid-infrared diagnostics based largely on data from the Spitzer
Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS). Our main result is that these
mid-infrared diagnostics effectively constrain a target's dominant power
source. The combination of a high ionization line index and PAH strength serves
as an efficient discriminant between AGN and star-forming nuclei, confirming
progress made with ISO spectroscopy on starbursting and ultraluminous infrared
galaxies. The sensitivity of Spitzer allows us to probe fainter nuclei and
star-forming regions within galaxy disks. We find that both star-forming nuclei
and extranuclear regions stand apart from nuclei that are powered by Seyfert or
LINER activity. In fact, we identify areas within three diagnostic diagrams
containing >90% Seyfert/LINER nuclei or >90% HII regions/HII nuclei. We also
find that, compared to starbursting nuclei, extranuclear regions typically
separate even further from AGN, especially for low-metallicity extranuclear
environments. In addition, instead of the traditional mid-infrared approach to
differentiating between AGN and star-forming sources that utilizes relatively
weak high-ionization lines, we show that strong low-ionization cooling lines of
X-ray dominated regions like [SiII] 34.82 micron can alternatively be used as
excellent discrimants.",2006-04-01T16:29:38Z
"Size and properties of the narrow-line region in Seyfert-2 galaxies from
  spatially-resolved optical spectroscopy","While [OIII] narrow-band imaging is commonly used to measure the size of the
narrow-line regions (NLRs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), it can be
contaminated by emission from surrounding starbursts. Recently, we have shown
that long-slit spectroscopy provides a valuable alternative approach to probe
the size in terms of AGN photoionisation. Moreover, several parameters of the
NLR can be directly accessed. We here apply the same methods developed and
described for the Seyfert-2 galaxy NGC1386 to study the NLR of five other
Seyfert-2 galaxies by using high-sensitivity spatially-resolved optical
spectroscopy obtained at the VLT and the NTT. We probe the AGN-photoionisation
of the NLR and thus, its ``real'' size using diagnostic line-ratio diagrams.We
derive physical properties of the NLR such as reddening, ionisation parameter,
electron density, and velocity as a function of distance from the nucleus. For
NGC5643, the diagnostic diagrams unveil a similar transition between line
ratios falling in the AGN regime and those typical for HII regions as found for
NGC1386, thus determining the size of the NLR. For the other four objects, all
measured line ratios fall in the AGN regime. In almost all cases, both electron
density and ionisation parameter decrease with radius. Deviations from this
general behaviour (such as a secondary peak) seen in both the ionisation
parameter and electron density can be interpreted as signs of shocks from the
interaction of a radio jet and the NLR gas. In several objects, the gaseous
velocity distribution is characteristic for rotational motion in an (inclined)
emission-line disk in the centre. We compare our results to those of NGC1386
and show that the latter can be considered as prototypical also for this larger
sample. We discuss our findings in detail for each object.",2006-06-14T23:45:42Z
First Detection of HCO+ Emission at High Redshift,"We report the detection of HCO+(1-0) emission towards the Cloverleaf quasar
(z=2.56) through observations with the Very Large Array. This is the first
detection of ionized molecular gas emission at high redshift (z>2). HCO+
emission is a star formation indicator similar to HCN, tracing dense molecular
hydrogen gas (n(H_2) ~= 10^5 cm^{-3}) within star-forming molecular clouds. We
derive a lensing-corrected HCO+ line luminosity of L'(HCO+) = 3.5 x 10^9 K km/s
pc^2. Combining our new results with CO and HCN measurements from the
literature, we find a HCO+/CO luminosity ratio of 0.08 and a HCO+/HCN
luminosity ratio of 0.8. These ratios fall within the scatter of the same
relationships found for low-z star-forming galaxies. However, a HCO+/HCN
luminosity ratio close to unity would not be expected for the Cloverleaf if the
recently suggested relation between this ratio and the far-infrared luminosity
were to hold. We conclude that a ratio between HCO+ and HCN luminosity close to
1 is likely due to the fact that the emission from both lines is optically
thick and thermalized and emerges from dense regions of similar volumes. The
CO, HCN and HCO+ luminosities suggest that the Cloverleaf is a composite
AGN--starburst system, in agreement with the previous finding that about 20% of
the total infrared luminosity in this system results from dust heated by star
formation rather than heating by the AGN. We conclude that HCO+ is potentially
a good tracer for dense molecular gas at high redshift.",2006-05-17T21:52:25Z
"Full evolutionary models for PG1159 stars. Implications for the
  helium-rich O(He) stars","We present full evolutionary calculations appropriate to post-AGB PG1159
stars for a wide range of stellar masses.
  We take into account the complete evolutionary stages of PG1159 progenitors
starting from the Zero Age Main Sequence. We consider the two kinds of Born
Again Scenarios, the very late thermal pulse (VLTP) and the late thermal pulse
(LTP), that give rise to hydrogen-deficient compositions. The location of our
PG1159 tracks in the effective temperature - gravity diagram and their
comparison with previous calculations as well as the resulting surface
compositions are discussed at some length.
  Our results reinforce the idea that the different abundances of $^{14}$N
observed at the surface of those PG1159 stars with undetected hydrogen is an
indication that the progenitors of these stars would have evolved through a
VLTP episode, where most of the hydrogen content of the remnant is burnt, or
LTP, where hydrogen is not burnt but instead diluted to very low surface
abundances. We derive new values for spectroscopical masses based on these new
models. We discuss the correlation between the presence of planetary nebulae
and the $^{14}$N abundance as another indicator that $^{14}$N-rich objects
should come from a VLTP episode while $^{14}$N-deficient ones should be the
result of a LTP. Finally, we discuss an evolutionary scenario that could
explain the existence of PG1159 stars with unusually high helium abundances and
a possible evolutionary connection between these stars and the low mass O(He)
stars.",2006-03-31T09:34:40Z
"Simulating Anisotropic Thermal Conduction in Supernova Remnants I :
  Numerics and the Evolution of Remnants","Anisotropic thermal conduction plays an important role in various
astrophysical systems. One of the most stringent tests of thermal conduction
can be found in supernova remnants. In this paper we study anisotropic thermal
conduction and examine the physical nature of the flux of thermal conduction in
the classical and saturated limits. We also present a temporally second-order
accurate implicit-explicit scheme for the time-update of thermal conduction
terms within a numerical MHD scheme.
  Several simulations of supernova remnants are presented for a range of ISM
parameters. The role of thermal conduction in such remnants has been studied.
We find that thermal conduction produces cooler temperatures and higher
densities in the hot gas bubbles that form in the remnants. The effect of
thermal conduction in changing the thermal characteristics of the hot gas
bubble increases as the remnant propagates through denser ISMs. Remnants
evolving in denser ISMs are shown to make a faster transition to a
centre-bright x-ray morphology, with the trend emerging earlier in hard x-rays
than in the soft x-rays.",2006-06-01T17:25:05Z
"The Dependence of the Mass Assembly History of Cold Dark Matter Halos on
  Environment","We show by means of a high-resolution N-body simulation how the mass assembly
histories of galaxy-size cold dark matter (CDM) halos depend on environment.
Halos in high density environments form earlier and a higher fraction of their
mass is assembled in major mergers, compared to low density environments. The
distribution of the present-day specific mass aggregation rate is strongly
dependent on environment. While in low density environments only ~20% of the
halos are not accreting mass at the present epoch, this fraction rises to ~80%
at high densities. At z=1 the median of the specific aggregation rate is ~4
times larger than at z=0 and almost independent on environment. All the
dependences on environment found here are critically enhanced by local
processes associated to subhalos because the fraction of subhalos increases as
the environment gets denser. The distribution of the halo specific mass
aggregation rate as well as its dependence on environment resemble the
relations for the specific star formation rate distribution of galaxies. An
analogue of the morphology-density relation is also present at the level of CDM
halos, being driven by the halo major merging history. Nevertheless, baryonic
processes are necessary in order to explain further details and the evolution
of the star formation rate-, color- and morphology-environment relations.",2006-06-15T03:03:08Z
The early X-ray afterglows of optically bright and dark Gamma-Ray Bursts,"A systematical study on the early X-ray afterglows of both optically bright
and dark gamma-ray bursts (B-GRBs and D-GRBs) observed by Swift has been
presented. Our sample includes 25 GRBs. Among them 13 are B-GRBs and 12 are
D-GRBs. Our results show that the distributions of the X-ray afterglow fluxes
($F_{X}$), the gamma-ray fluxes ($S_{\gamma}$), and the ratio ($R_{\gamma, X}$)
for both the D-GRBs and B-GRBs are similar. The differences of these
distributions for the two kinds of GRBs should be statistical fluctuation.
These results indicate that the progenitors of the two kinds of GRBs are the
same population. Their total energy explosions are comparable. The suppression
of the optical emissions from D-GRBs should results from circumburst but not
their central engine.",2006-04-08T02:13:15Z
The distribution of SiO in the circumstellar envelope around IRC+10216,"New interferometric observations of SiO J=5-4 circumstellar line emission
around the carbon star IRC+10216, using the Submillimeter Array, are presented.
Complemented by multi-transition single-dish observations, including infrared
observations of ro-vibrational transitions, detailed radiative transfer
modelling suggests that the fractional abundance of SiO in the inner part of
the envelope, between approximately 3-8 stellar radii, is as high as 1.5E-6.
This is more than an order of magnitude higher than predicted by equilibrium
stellar atmosphere chemistry in a carbon-rich environment and indicative of the
importance of non-LTE chemical processes. In addition to the compact component,
a spatially more extended (2.4E16 cm) low-fractional-abundance (1.7E-7) region
is required to fit the observations. This suggests that the majority of the SiO
molecules are effectively accreted onto dust grains in the inner wind while the
remaining gas-phase molecules are eventually photodissociated at larger
distances. Evidence of departure from a smooth wind is found in the observed
visibilities, indicative of density variations of a factor 2 to 5 on an angular
scale corresponding to a time scale of about 200 years. Additionally,
constraints on the velocity structure of the wind are obtained.",2006-05-19T07:32:41Z
"An Upper Limit on the Albedo of HD 209458b: Direct Imaging Photometry
  with the MOST Satellite","We present space-based photometry of the transiting exoplanetary system HD
209458 obtained with the MOST (Microvariablity and Oscillations of STars)
satellite, spanning 14 days and covering 4 transits and 4 secondary eclipses.
The HD 209458 photometry was obtained in MOST's lower-precision Direct Imaging
mode, which is used for targets in the brightness range $6.5 < V < 13$. We
describe the photometric reduction techniques for this mode of observing, in
particular the corrections for stray Earthshine. We do not detect the secondary
eclipse in the MOST data, to a limit in depth of 0.053 mmag (1 \sigma). We set
a 1 \sigma upper limit on the planet-star flux ratio of 4.88 x 10^-5
corresponding to a geometric albedo upper limit in the MOST bandpass (400 to
700 nm) of 0.25. The corresponding numbers at the 3 \sigma level are 1.34 x
10^-4 and 0.68 respectively. HD 209458b is half as bright as Jupiter in the
MOST bandpass. This low geometric albedo value is an important constraint for
theoretical models of the HD209458b atmosphere, in particular ruling out the
presence of reflective clouds. A second MOST campaign on HD 209458 is expected
to be sensitive to an exoplanet albedo as low as 0.13 (1 sigma), if the star
does not become more intrinsically variable in the meantime.",2006-03-16T00:33:52Z
"Nearby Supernova Factory Observations of SN 2005gj: Another Type Ia
  Supernova in a Massive Circumstellar Envelope","We report Nearby Supernova Factory observations of SN 2005gj, the second
confirmed case of a ""hybrid"" Type Ia/IIn supernova. Our early-phase photometry
of SN 2005gj shows that the interaction is much stronger than for the
prototype, SN 2002ic. Our first spectrum shows a hot continuum with broad and
narrow H-alpha emission. Later spectra, spanning over 4 months from outburst,
show clear Type Ia features combined with broad and narrow H-gamma, H-beta,
H-alpha and HeI 5876,7065 in emission. At higher resolution, P Cygni profiles
are apparent. Surprisingly, we also observe an inverted P Cygni profile for
[OIII] 5007. We find that the lightcurve and measured velocity of the unshocked
circumstellar material imply mass loss as recently as 8 years ago. The early
lightcurve is well-described by a flat radial density profile for the
circumstellar material. However, our decomposition of the spectra into Type Ia
and shock emission components allows for little obscuration of the supernova,
suggesting an aspherical or clumpy distribution for the circumstellar material.
We suggest that the emission line velocity profiles arise from electron
scattering rather than the kinematics of the shock. This is supported by the
inferred high densities, and the lack of evidence for evolution in the line
widths. Ground- and space-based photometry, and Keck spectroscopy, of the host
galaxy are used to ascertain that the host galaxy has low metallicity Z/Zsun <
0.3; (95% confidence) and that this galaxy is undergoing a significant star
formation event that began roughly 200+/-70 Myr ago. We discuss the
implications of these observations for progenitor models and cosmology using
Type Ia supernovae.",2006-06-20T21:28:11Z
Are f(R) dark energy models cosmologically viable ?,"All $f(R)$ modified gravity theories are conformally identical to models of
quintessence in which matter is coupled to dark energy with a strong coupling.
This coupling induces a cosmological evolution radically different from
standard cosmology. We find that in all $f(R)$ theories that behave as a power
of $R$ at large or small $R$ (which include most of those proposed so far in
the literature) the scale factor during the matter phase grows as $t^{1/2}$
instead of the standard law $t^{2/3}$. This behaviour is grossly inconsistent
with cosmological observations (e.g. WMAP), thereby ruling out these models
even if they pass the supernovae test and can escape the local gravity
constraints.",2006-03-27T01:40:24Z
"Temporal Evolution of Pair Attenuation Signatures in Gamma-Ray Burst
  Spectra","The spectra obtained above 100 MeV by the EGRET experiment aboard the Compton
Gamma-Ray Observatory for a handful of gamma-ray bursts has given no indication
of any spectral attenuation that might preclude detection of bursts at higher
energies. With the discovery of optical afterglows and counterparts to bursts
in the last few years, enabling the determination of significant redshifts for
these sources, it is anticipated that profound spectral attenuation will arise
in the Gamma-Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) energy band of 30 MeV-300
GeV for many if not most bursts. This paper explores time-dependent
expectations for burst spectral properties in the EGRET/GLAST band, focusing on
how attenuation of photons by pair creation internal to the source generates
distinctive spectral signatures. The energy of spectral breaks and the
associated spectral indices provide valuable information that constrains the
bulk Lorentz factor of the GRB outflow at a given time. Moreover, the distinct
temporal behavior that is present for internal attenuation is easily
distinguished from extrinsic absorption due to intervening cosmic background
fields. These characteristics define palpable observational goals for both
spaced-based hard gamma-ray experiments such as GLAST, and ground-based
Cherenkov telescopes, and strongly impact the observability of bursts above 300
MeV.",2006-06-17T17:40:30Z
The Central Engines of 19 LINERs as Viewed by Chandra,"Using archival Chandra observations of 19 LINERs we explore the X-ray
properties of their inner kiloparsec to determine the origin of their nuclear
X-ray emission, to investigate the presence of an AGN, and to identify the
power source of the optical emission lines. The relative numbers of LINER types
in our sample are similar to those in optical spectroscopic surveys. We find
that diffuse, thermal emission is very common and is concentrated within the
central few hundred parsec. The average spectra of the hot gas in spirals and
ellipticals are very similar to those of normal galaxies. They can be fitted
with a thermal plasma (kT~0.5 keV) plus a power law (photon index of 1.3-1.5)
model. There are on average 3 detected point sources in their inner kiloparsec
with L(0.5-10 keV)~10^37-10^40 erg/s. The average cumulative luminosity
functions for sources in spirals and ellipticals are identical to those of
normal galaxies. In the innermost circle of 2.5"" radius in each galaxy we find
an AGN in 12 of the 19 galaxies. The AGNs contribute a median of 60% of the
0.5-10 keV luminosity of the central 2.5"" region, they have luminosities of
10^37-10^39 erg/s (Eddington ratios 10^-8 to 10^-5). The ionizing luminosity of
the AGNs is not enough to power the observed optical emission lines in this
particular sample. Thus, we suggest that the lines are powered either by the
mechanical interaction of an AGN jet (or wind) with the circumnuclear gas, or
by stellar processes, e.g. photoionization by post-AGB stars or young stars.",2006-04-24T03:59:34Z
"Enhancing the Pierre Auger Observatory to the 10^{17} to 10^{18.5} eV
  Range: Capabilities of an Infill Surface Array","The Pierre Auger Observatory has been designed to study the highest-energy
cosmic rays in nature (E > 10^{18.5} eV). The determination of their arrival
direction, energy and composition is performed by the analysis of the
atmospheric showers they produce. The Auger Surface Array will consist of 1600
water Cerenkov detectors placed in an equilateral triangular grid of 1.5 km
spacing. The aim of this paper is to show that the addition of a ""small"" area
of surface detectors at half or less the above mentioned spacing would allow a
dramatic increase of the physical scope of this Observatory, reaching lower
energies at which the transition from galactic to extragalactic sources is
expected.",2006-07-06T18:36:54Z
The GOODS-North Radio Galaxies: On the Origin of the Radio Emission,"We report on a preliminary study concerning the origin of radio emission
within radio galaxies at L(1.4GHz)>1E24 W/Hz in the GOODS-N field. In the local
universe, Condon et al. (2002) and Yun et al. (2001) have shown that in
galaxies with radio luminosities greater than 1E23 W/Hz the majority of the
radio emission originates from a `monster' i.e., an AGN. Using the Chandra
2Msec X-ray image centered on the GOODS-N field and a reprocessed VLA HDF
A-array data plus newly acquired VLA B-array data (rms=5.3microJy), we find
that radio galaxies (with spectroscopic redshifts; all have z>1) with
L(1.4GHz)>1E24 W/Hz typically have an X-ray detection rate of 72% (60% emit
hard X-rays suggesting an AGN origin for the radio emission) in contrast to 25%
for radio galaxies with L < 1E23 W/Hz. The ACS images of these L(1.4 GHz) >
1E24 W/Hz galaxies typically show compact rather than extended galaxy
morphology which is generally found for the less luminous radio emitting
galaxies but a few appear to be ongoing galaxy mergers. We also present SED
fitting for these luminous radio galaxies including Spitzer IRAC & MIPS 24um
photometry and 60% show distinct power-law SED indicative of an AGN. Initial
results tell us that the X-ray emitting radio galaxy population are generally
not submm sources but the few (~10%) that are SCUBA sources appear to be the
small AGN population found by Pope et al. and others.",2006-03-16T04:38:58Z
"A Survey of Merger Remnants III: Are Merger Remnants Supported by
  Rotation or Anisotropy","A growing body of observational evidence suggests that the luminosity,
photometric shape and amount of rotational or anisotropical support in
elliptical galaxies may provide vital clues to how they formed. Elliptical
galaxies appear to fall into two distinct categories based on these parameters:
bright, boxy shaped, with little or no rotation, and less luminous, disky
shaped with significant rotation. One viable formation scenario is the ``Merger
hypothesis,'' in which two disk galaxies merge to form a new elliptical galaxy.
A comparison of the luminosity, photometric shape, and amount of rotation in
advanced merger remnants may shed more light on the possible formation
scenarios of elliptical galaxies. Yet, little observational data exists for
such merger remnants. This paper is the third in a series investigating the
photometric and kinematic properties of a sample of 51 optically selected
advanced merger remnants. Presented here are K-band isophotal shapes and
spatially resolved kinematics for a sub-sample of 37 merger remnants. The
results show that ~ 11% of the sample are boxy, and anisotropically supported
while ~ 47% are disky, and rotationally supported. The remainder of the sample
show variations among expected correlations between shape and rotation. This
may suggest that the isophotal shapes are still ``in flux.'' There does appear
to be a lower limit to the amount of anisotropy observed in the merger
remnants. This may provide an observational diagnostic for discriminating among
formation scenarios in elliptical galaxies.",2006-04-24T15:23:50Z
Stellar Rotation: A Clue to the Origin of High Mass Stars?,"We present the results of a study aimed at assessing whether low and high
mass stars form similarly. Our approach is (1) to examine the observed
projected rotational velocities among a large sample of newly-formed stars
spanning a range in mass between 0.2 and 50 M ; and (2) to search for evidence
of a discontinuity in rotational properties that might indicate a difference in
the stellar formation process at some characteristic mass. Our database
includes both recently published values of v sin i for young intermediate- and
low- mass stars in Orion, as well as new observations of O stars located in
young clusters and OB associations. We find that the median of the quantity
v_obs/v_c (observed rotational speed/equatorial breakup velocity) is typically
about 0.15 and shows no evidence of a discontinuity over the full range of
stellar masses, while the quantity Jsini/M (derived angular momentum per unit
mass) exhibits a slow, monotonic rise with increasing mass with no evidence of
a discontinuity. We suggest that these observations are most simply interpreted
as indicative of a single stellar formation and angular momentum regulation
mechanism: one that results in rotation rates well below breakup, and angular
momenta per unit mass that differ systematically by no more than a factor of
3-4 over a mass range spanning a factor of 250.",2006-04-25T23:49:13Z
"Quasars Probing Quasars II: The Anisotropic Clustering of Optically
  Thick Absorbers around Quasars","With close pairs of quasars at different redshifts, a background quasar
sightline can be used to study a foreground quasar's environment in absorption.
We used a sample of 17 Lyman limit systems with column density N_HI > 10^19
cm^-2 selected from 149 projected quasar pair sightlines, to investigate the
clustering pattern of optically thick absorbers around luminous quasars at z ~
2.5. Specifically, we measured the quasar-absorber correlation function in the
transverse direction, and found a comoving correlation length of
r_0=9.2_{+1.5}_{-1.7} Mpc/h (comoving) assuming a power law correlation
function, with gamma=1.6. Applying this transverse clustering strength to the
line-of-sight, would predict that ~ 15-50% of all quasars should show a N_HI >
10^19 cm^-2 absorber within a velocity window of v < 3000 km/s. This
overpredicts the number of absorbers along the line-of-sight by a large factor,
providing compelling evidence that the clustering pattern of optically thick
absorbers around quasars is highly anisotropic. The most plausible
explanationfor the anisotropy is that the transverse direction is less likely
to be illuminated by ionizing photons than the line-of-sight, and that
absorbers along the line-of-sight are being photoevaporated. A simple model for
the photoevaporation of absorbers subject to the ionizing flux of a quasar is
presented, and it is shown that absorbers with volume densities n_H < 0.1 cm^-3
will be photoevaporated if they lie within ~ 1 Mpc (proper) of a luminous
quasar. Using this simple model, we illustrate how comparisons of the
transverse and line-of-sight clustering around quasars can ultimately be used
to constrain the distribution of gas in optically thick absorption line
systems.",2006-06-05T05:45:36Z
Reaction Rate Uncertainties: NeNa and MgAl in AGB Stars,"We study the effect of uncertainties in the proton-capture reaction rates of
the NeNa and MgAl chains on nucleosynthesis due to the operation of hot bottom
burning (HBB) in intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. HBB
nucleosynthesis is associated with the production of sodium, radioactive Al26
and the heavy magnesium isotopes, and it is possibly responsible for the O, Na,
Mg and Al abundance anomalies observed in globular cluster stars.
  We model HBB with an analytic code based on full stellar evolution models so
we can quickly cover a large parameter space. The reaction rates are varied
first individually, then all together. This creates a knock-on effect, where an
increase of one reaction rate affects production of an isotope further down the
reaction chain. We find the yields of Ne22, Na23 and Al26 to be the most
susceptible to current nuclear reaction rate uncertainties.",2006-07-24T12:17:45Z
A Search for Radio Emission from Type Ia Supernovae,"We present and discuss the radio observations of 27 Type Ia supernovae (SNe
Ia) observed over two decades with the Very Large Array. No SN Ia has been
detected so far in the radio, implying a very low density for any possible
circumstellar material established by the progenitor, or progenitor system,
before explosion. We derive 2-sigma upper limits to a steady mass-loss rate for
individual SN systems as low as ~3 X 10^{-8} Msun yr^{-1}, discriminating
strongly against white dwarf accretion via a stellar wind from a massive binary
companion in the symbiotic star, an example of the ``single degenerate''
scenario. However, a white dwarf accreting from a relatively low mass companion
via a sufficiently high efficiency (>60-80%), Roche lobe overflow is still
consistent with our limits. The ``double degenerate'' merger scenario also
cannot be excluded.",2006-03-30T00:56:29Z
The Field of Streams: Sagittarius and its Siblings,"We use Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 5 (DR5) u,g,r,i,z
photometry to study Milky Way halo substructure in the area around the North
Galactic Cap. A simple color cut (g-r < 0.4) reveals the tidal stream of the
Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal, as well as a number of other stellar structures
in the field. Two branches (A and B) of the Sagittarius stream are clearly
visible in an RGB-composite image created from 3 magnitude slices, and there is
also evidence for a still more distant wrap behind the A branch. A comparison
of these data with numerical models suggests that the shape of the Galactic
dark halo is close to spherical.",2006-05-01T12:58:45Z
"The Evolution of Low Mass Helium Stars towards Supernova Type I
  Explosion","We explore the hypothesis, that helium stars in a certain mass range can
evolve to a carbon core explosion similar to what is widely accepted as an
explanation for the SN I phenomenon. This should happen when their
carbon-oxygen core grows thanks to the helium shell burning above the core. We
found that in the mass range of about 1.7-2.2 Msun, indeed this can happen.
  The main new insight we believe we gained is the crucial importance of an
""early"" off-center ignition of carbon, which at a later stage prevents the
carbon which forms below the helium burning shell and ignites, from burning the
carbon all the way to the center. When helium is almost depleted in the
convective envelope by the helium burning shell at its bottom, the now
super-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen core contracts, and the residual
degenerate carbon at the center is ignited, resulting in a runaway similar to
the classical SN I scenario.
  Since the structure and behavior of the carbon-oxygen core of the helium
stars of our interest is very similar to that of a mass accreting carbon-oxygen
star, we also thoroughly examined the behavior of carbon-oxygen stars. We
discovered that the models which ignite carbon off-center (in the mass range of
about 1.05-1.18 Msun, depending on the carbon mass fraction) present an
interesting SN I progenitor scenario of their own, since whereas in the
standard scenario runaway always takes place at the same density of about 2E9
gr/cm3, in our case, due to the small amount of carbon ignited, we get a whole
range of densities from 1E9 up to 6E9 gr/cm3.",2006-05-29T06:54:27Z
Nuclear activity in galaxies driven by binary supermassive black holes,"Nuclear activity in galaxies is closely connected to galactic mergers and
supermassive black holes (SBH). Galactic mergers perturb substantially the
dynamics of gas and stellar population in the merging galaxies, and they are
expected to lead to formation of supermassive binary black holes (BBH) in the
center of mass of the galaxies merged. A scheme is proposed here that connects
the peak magnitude of the nuclear activity with evolution of a BBH system. The
scheme predicts correctly the relative fractions of different types of active
galactic nuclei (AGN) and explains the connection between the galactic type and
the strength of the nuclear activity. It shows that most powerful AGN should
result from mergers with small mass ratios, while weaker activity is produced
in unequal mergers. The scheme explains also the observed lack of galaxies with
two active nuclei, which is attributed to effective disruption of accretion
disks around the secondary in BBH systems with masses of the primary smaller
than ~10^10 solar masses.",2006-06-08T16:04:30Z
"Simulations of Galactic Cosmic Rays Impacts on the Herschel/PACS
  Photoconductor Arrays with Geant4 Code","We present results of simulations performed with the Geant4 software code of
the effects of Galactic Cosmic Ray impacts on the photoconductor arrays of the
PACS instrument. This instrument is part of the ESA-Herschel payload, which
will be launched in late 2007 and will operate at the Lagrangian L2 point of
the Sun-Earth system. Both the Satellite plus the cryostat (the shield) and the
detector act as source of secondary events, affecting the detector performance.
Secondary event rates originated within the detector and from the shield are of
comparable intensity. The impacts deposit energy on each photoconductor pixel
but do not affect the behaviour of nearby pixels. These latter are hit with a
probability always lower than 7%. The energy deposited produces a spike which
can be hundreds times larger than the noise. We then compare our simulations
with proton irradiation tests carried out for one of the detector modules and
follow the detector behaviour under 'real' conditions.",2006-06-29T11:57:26Z
"Supermassive black hole formation during the assembly of pre-galactic
  discs","In this paper we discuss the evolution of gravitationally unstable
pre-galactic discs that result from the collapse of haloes at high redshift $z
\approx 10$ or so, which have not yet been enriched by metals. In cases where
molecular hydrogen formation is suppressed the discs are maintained at a
temperature of a few thousand degrees Kelvin. However, when molecular hydrogen
is present cooling can proceed down to a few hundred degrees Kelvin. Analogous
to the case of the larger scale proto-galactic discs, we assume that the
evolution of these discs is mainly driven by angular momentum redistribution
induced by the development of gravitational instabilities in the disc. We also
properly take into account the possibility of disc fragmentation. We thus show
that this simple model naturally predicts the formation of supermassive black
holes in the nuclei of such discs and provides a robust determination of their
mass distribution as a function of halo properties. We estimate that roughly 5%
of discs resulting from the collapse of haloes with $M\approx 10^7 M_{\odot}$
should host a massive black hole with a mass $M_{\rm BH}\approx 10^5
M_{\odot}$. We confirm our arguments with time-dependent calculations of the
evolution of the surface density and of the accretion rate in these primordial
discs. This mechanism offers an efficient way to form seed black holes at high
redshift. The predicted masses for our black hole seeds enable the comfortable
assembly of $10^9 M_{\odot}$ black holes powering the luminous quasars detected
by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at $z = 6$ for a concordance cosmology.

Probable detection of H2D+ in the starless core Barnard 68,"The presence of H2D+ in dense cloud cores underlies ion-molecule reactions
that strongly enhance the deuterium fractionation of many molecular species. We
determine the H2D+ abundance in one starless core, Barnard 68, that has a
particularly well established physical, chemical, and dynamical structure. We
observed the ortho-H2D+ ground-state line 1_10-1_11, the N2H+ J=4-3 line, and
the H13CO+ 4-3 line with the APEX telescope. We report the probable detection
of the o-H2D+ line at an intensity Tmb=0.22 +- 0.08 K and exclusively thermal
line width, and find only upper limits to the N2H+ 4-3 and H13CO+ 4-3
intensities. Within the uncertainties in the chemical reaction rates and the
collisional excitation rates, chemical model calculations and excitation
simulations reproduce the observed intensities and that of o-H2D+ in
particular.",2006-05-22T12:33:49Z
"New Technique for the Measurement of the Scintillation Efficiency of
  Nuclear Recoils","We present a new technique developed for the measurement of the scintillation
efficiency of nuclear recoils in solid scintillators. Using this technique we

The first year of SN 2004dj in NGC 2403,"New BVRI photometry and optical spectroscopy of the Type IIp supernova 2004dj
in NGC 2403, obtained during the first year since discovery, are presented. The
progenitor cluster, Sandage 96, is also detected on pre-explosion frames. The
light curve indicates that the explosion occured about 30 days before
discovery, and the plateau phase lasted about +110 \pm 20 days after that. The
plateau-phase spectra have been modelled with the SYNOW spectral synthesis code
using H, NaI, TiII, ScII, FeII and BaII lines. The SN distance is inferred from
the Expanding Photosphere Method and the Standard Candle Method applicable for
SNe IIp. They resulted in distances that are consistent with each other as well
as earlier Cepheid- and Tully-Fisher distances. The average distance, D = 3.47
\pm 0.29 Mpc is proposed for SN 2004dj and NGC 2403. The nickel mass produced
by the explosion is estimated as 0.02 \pm 0.01 M_o. The SED of the progenitor
cluster is reanalysed by fitting population synthesis models to our observed
BVRI data supplemented by U and JKH magnitudes from the literature. The
chi^2-minimization revealed a possible ""young"" solution with cluster age T_{cl}
= 8 Myr, and an ""old"" solution with T_{cl} = 20 - 30 Myr. The ""young"" solution
would imply a progenitor mass M > 20 M_o, which is higher than the previously
detected progenitor masses for Type II SNe.",2006-04-11T07:02:35Z
Possible Detection of OVI from the LMC Superbubble N70,"We present FUSE observations toward four stars in the LMC superbubble N70 and
compare these spectra to those of four comparison targets located in nearby
field and diffuse regions. The N70 sight lines show OVI 1032 absorption that is
consistently stronger than the comparison sight lines by ~60%. We attribute the
excess column density (logN_OVI=14.03 cm^-2) to hot gas within N70, potentially
the first detection of OVI associated with a superbubble. In a survey of 12 LMC
sight lines, Howk et al. (2002a) concluded that there was no correlation
between ISM morphology and N_OVI. We present a reanalysis of their measurements
combined with our own and find a clear difference between the superbubble and
field samples. The five superbubbles probed to date with FUSE show a
consistently higher mean N_OVI than the 12 non-superbubble sight lines, though
both samples show equivalent scatter from halo variability. Possible ionization
mechanisms for N70 are discussed, and we conclude that the observed OVI could
be the product of thermal conduction at the interface between the hot, X-ray
emitting gas inside the superbubble and the cooler, photoionized material
making up the shell seen prominently in Halpha. We calculate the total hydrogen
density n_H implied by our OVI measurements and find a value consistent with
expectations. Finally, we discuss emission-line observations of OVI from N70.",2006-03-30T02:17:16Z
"Physical properties of two compact high-velocity clouds possibly
  associated with the Leading Arm of the Magellanic System","We observed two compact high-velocity clouds HVC 291+26+195 and HVC
297+09+253 to analyse their structure, dynamics, and physical parameters. In
both cases there is evidence for an association with the Leading Arm of the
Magellanic Clouds. The goal of our study is to learn more about the origin of
the two CHVCs and to use them as probes for the structure and evolution of the
Leading Arm. We have used the Parkes 64 m radio telescope and the Australia
Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) to study the two CHVCs in the 21 cm line
emission of neutral hydrogen. We present a method to estimate the distance of
the two CHVCs. The investigation of the line profiles of HVC 297+09+253 reveals
the presence of two line components in the spectra which can be identified with
a cold and a warm gas phase. In addition, we find a distinct head-tail
structure in combination with a radial velocity gradient along the tail,
suggesting a ram-pressure interaction of this cloud with an ambient medium. HVC
291+26+195 has only a cold gas phase and no head-tail structure. The ATCA data
show several cold, compact clumps in both clouds which, in the case of HVC
297+09+253, are embedded in the warm, diffuse envelope. All these clumps have
very narrow HI lines with typical line widths between 2 and 4 km/s FWHM,
yielding an upper limit for the kinetic temperature of the gas of T_max = 300
K. We obtain distance estimates for both CHVCs of the order of 10 to 60 kpc,
providing additional evidence for an association of the clouds with the Leading
Arm.",2006-07-17T14:32:15Z
Effects of a Supermassive Black Hole Binary on a Nuclear Gas Disk,"We study influence of a galactic central supermassive black hole (SMBH)
binary on gas dynamics and star formation activity in a nuclear gas disk by
making three-dimensional Tree+SPH simulations. Due to orbital motions of SMBHs,
there are various resonances between gas motion and the SMBH binary motion. We
have shown that these resonances create some characteristic structures of gas
in the nuclear gas disk, for examples, gas elongated or filament structures,
formation of gaseous spiral arms, and small gas disks around SMBHs. In these
gaseous dense regions, active star formations are induced. As the result, many
star burst regions are formed in the nuclear region.",2006-06-07T08:34:33Z
"The Black Hole in NGC 3379: A Comparison of Gas and Stellar Dynamical
  Mass Measurements with HST and Integral-Field Data","We combine Hubble Space Telescope spectroscopy and ground-based
integral-field data from the SAURON and OASIS instruments to study the central
black hole in the nearby elliptical galaxy NGC 3379. From these data, we obtain
kinematics of both the stars and the nuclear gaseous component. Axisymmetric
three-integral models of the stellar kinematics find a black hole of mass 1.4
(+2.6 / -1.0) x 10^8 M_sun (3 sigma errors). These models also probe the
velocity distribution in the immediate vicinity of the black hole and reveal a
nearly isotropic velocity distribution throughout the galaxy and down to the
black hole sphere of influence R_BH. The morphology of the nuclear gas disc
suggests that it is not in the equatorial plane; however the core of NGC 3379
is nearly spherical. Inclined thin-disc models of the gas find a nominal black
hole of mass 2.0 (+/- 0.1) x 10^8 M_sun (3 sigma errors), but the model is a
poor fit to the kinematics. The data are better fit by introducing a twist in
the gas kinematics (with the black hole mass assumed to be 2.0 x 10^8 M_sun),
although the constraints on the nature and shape of this perturbation are
insufficient for more detailed modelling. Given the apparent regularity of the
gas disc's appearance, the presence of such strong non-circular motion
indicates that caution must be used when measuring black hole masses with gas
dynamical methods alone.",2006-05-19T01:35:51Z
"Non-thermal intracluster medium: a simultaneous interpretation of the
  central soft X-ray excess and WMAP's detection of reduced Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
  Effect","WMAP's detection of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect at a much reduced level
among several large samples of rich clusters is interpreted in terms of
conventional physics. It has been suggested that the central soft X-ray and EUV
excess found in some clusters cannot be of thermal origin, due to problems with
rapid gas cooling and the persistent non-detection of the O VII line, but may
arise from inverse-Compton scattering between intracluster relativistic
electrons and the cosmic microwave background. In fact, recent XMM observations
of the soft X-rays from Coma and Abell 3112 are equally well fitted by a power
law or a thermal virialized gas. Therefore the missing Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux
could partly be due to an overestimate of the central density of virialized
electrons which scatter the CMB. Synchrotron radiation in an intracluster
magnetic field of strength of a few $\mu$G is responsible for significant
additional electron energy loss. Equipartition between relativistic particle
and magnetic field energy densities is a realistic possibility. GHz radiation
data from a Coma cluster halo yields information on the high energy steepening
of the cluster relativistic electron spectrum. Cluster microwave emission in
the WMAP passbands by higher energy cosmic ray electrons and gamma ray emission
from an accompanying cosmic ray proton flux are also considered. The energetic
electrons could originate from AGN jet injection, then distributed cluster-wide
by Alfven wave sweeping, with accompanying {\it in situ} Fermi acceleration.",2006-07-13T19:46:43Z
Slow evolution of elliptical galaxies induced by dynamical friction,"Many astrophysical problems, ranging from structure formation in cosmology to
dynamics of elliptical galaxies, refer to slow processes of evolution of
essentially collisionless self-gravitating systems. In order to determine the
relevant quasi-equilibrium configuration at time t from given initial
conditions, it is often argued that such slow evolution may be approximated in
terms of adiabatic evolution, for the calculation of which efficient
semi--analytical techniques are available. Here we focus on the slow process of
evolution, induced by dynamical friction of a host stellar system on a minority
component of ""satellites"", that we have investigated in a previous paper, to
determine to what extent an adiabatic description might be applied. The study
is realized by comparing directly N--body simulations of the stellar system
evolution (in two significantly different models) from initial to final
conditions in a controlled numerical environment. We demonstrate that for the
examined process the adiabatic description is going to provide incorrect
answers, not only quantitatively, but also qualitatively. The two classes of
models considered exhibit generally similar trends in evolution, with one
exception noted in relation to the evolution of the total density profile. This
simple conclusion should be taken as a warning against the indiscriminate use
of adiabatic growth prescriptions in studies of structure of galaxies.",2006-03-18T12:42:59Z
Time-Delay Measurement for the Quadruple Lens RX J1131-1231,"We have measured the three time delays for the quadruple gravitational lens
RX J1131-1231 using two seasons of monitoring data. The short delays between
cusp images are A-B = 11.98 +1.52,-1.27 days and A-C = 9.61 +1.97,-1.57 days.
The long A-D delay for the counter image is not as precisely determined because
of the season gaps, but the data suggest a delay of -87 +- 8 days. The short
delays are difficult to explain using standard isothermal halo models of the
lensing potential, which instead prefer A-B and A-C delays of ~1 day for
reasonable values of the Hubble constant. Matching the cusp delays is possible
by adding a significant (~5 x 10^10 M_sun) amount of matter nearly coincident
(~0.05"" South-East) with the A image. Adding such a satellite also helps
improve the quasar and lens astrometry of the model, reduces the velocity
dispersion of the main lens and shifts it closer to the Fundamental Plane. This
is suggestive of a satellite galaxy to the primary lens, but its expected
luminosity and proximity to both image A and the system's bright Einstein ring
make visual identification impossible even with the existing HST data. We also
find evidence for significant structure along the line of sight toward the
lens. Archival Chandra observations show two nearby regions of extended X-ray
emission, each with bolometric X-ray luminosities of 2-3 x 10^43 ergs/s. The
brighter region is located 153"" from the lens and centered on a z=0.1
foreground cD galaxy, and the fainter and presumably more distant region is 4-5
times closer (in angular separation) to the lens and likely corresponds to the
weaker of two galaxy red sequences (which includes the lens galaxy) previously
detected at optical wavelengths.",2006-05-12T16:27:19Z
"Hard X-ray Bursts Detected by the IBIS Telescope Onboard the INTEGRAL
  Observatory in 2003-2004","All of the observations performed with the IBIS telescope onboard the
INTEGRAL observatory during the first one and a half years of its in-orbit
operation (from February 10, 2003, through July 2, 2004) have been analyzed to
find X-ray bursts. IBIS/ISGRI detector lightcurves total count rate in the
energy range 15-25 keV revealed 1077 bursts of durations from ~5 to ~500 s
detected with a high statistical significance (only one event over the entire
period of observations could be detected by a chance with a probability of
20%). Apart from the events associated with cosmic gamma-ray bursts (detected
in the field of view or passed through the IBIS shield), solar flares, and
activity of the soft gamma repeater SGR1806-20, we were able to localize 105
bursts and, with one exception, to identify them with previously known
persistent or transient X-ray sources (96 were identified with known X-ray
bursters). In one case, the burst source was a new burster in a low state. We
named it IGR J17364-2711. Basic parameters of the localized bursts and their
identifications are presented in the catalog of bursts. Curiously enough, 61
bursts were detected from one X-ray burster - GX 354-0. The statistical
distributions of bursts in duration, maximum flux, and recurrence time have
been analyzed for this source. Some of the bursts observed with the IBIS/ISGRI
telescope were also detected by the JEM-X telescope onboard the INTEGRAL
observatory in the standard X-ray energy range 3-20 keV.",2006-05-25T15:28:23Z
"Panchromatic Properties of 99,000 Galaxies Detected by SDSS, and (some
  by) ROSAT, GALEX, 2MASS, IRAS, GB6, FIRST, NVSS and WENSS Surveys","We discuss the panchromatic properties of 99,088 galaxies selected from the
SDSS Data Release 1 spectroscopic sample (a flux-limited sample for 1360
deg^2). These galaxies are positionally matched to sources detected by ROSAT,
GALEX, 2MASS, IRAS, GB6, FIRST, NVSS and WENSS. We find strong correlations
between the detection fraction at other wavelengths and optical properties such
as flux, colors, and emission-line strengths. Using GALEX, SDSS, and 2MASS
data, we construct the UV-IR broad-band spectral energy distributions for
various types of galaxies, and find that they form a nearly one-parameter
family. For example, based on SDSS u- and r-band data, supplemented with
redshift, the K-band 2MASS magnitudes can be ""predicted"" with an rms scatter of
only 0.2 mag. When a dust content estimate determined from SDSS data by
Kauffmann et al. (2003) is also utilized, this scatter decreases to 0.1 mag. We
demonstrate that this dust content is indeed higher for galaxies detected by
IRAS and that it can be used to ""predict"" measured IRAS 60 micron flux density
within a factor of two using only SDSS data. We also show that the position of
a galaxy in the emission-line-based Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagram is
correlated with the optical light concentration index and u-r color determined
from the SDSS broad-band imaging data, and discuss changes in the morphology of
this diagram induced by requiring detections at other wavelengths. We study the
IR-radio correlation and find evidence that its slope may be different for AGN
and star-forming galaxies and related to the H_alpha/H_beta line strength
ratio.",2006-06-14T17:47:34Z
"The Cornell High-order Adaptive Optics Survey for Brown Dwarfs in
  Stellar Systems-II: Results from Monte Carlo Population Analyses","In this second of a two-paper sequence, we present Monte Carlo population
simulation results of brown dwarf companion data collected during the Cornell
High-order Adaptive Optics Survey for brown dwarf companions (CHAOS). Making
reasonable assumptions of orbital parameters (random inclination, random
eccentricity and random longitude of pericentre) and age distributions, and
using published mass functions, we find that the brown dwarf companion fraction
around main sequence stars is 0.0%-9.3% for the 25-100 AU semi-major axis
region. We find a corresponding L-dwarf companion fraction of 0.0%-3.3%. We
compare our population analysis methods and results with techniques and results
presented by several other groups. In this comparison we discover that
systematic errors (most notably resulting from orbital projection effects)
occur in the majority of previously published brown dwarf companion population
estimates, leading authors to claim results not supported by the observational
data.",2006-05-11T07:41:20Z
Looking at the Fundamental Plane through a gravitational lens,"We consider the Fundamental Plane of elliptical galaxies lensed by the
gravitational field of a massive deflector (typically, a cluster of galaxies).
We show that the Fundamental Plane relation provides a straightforward
measurement of the projected mass distribution of the lens with a typical
accuracy of ~0.15 in the dimensionless column density kappa. The proposed
technique breaks the mass-sheet degeneracy completely and is thus expected to
serve as an important complement to other lensing-based analyses. Moreover, its
ability to measure directly the mass distribution on the small pencil beams
that characterize the size of background galaxies may lead to crucial tests for
current scenarios of structure formation.",2006-06-27T22:44:34Z
Tearing instability in relativistic magnetically dominated plasmas,"Many astrophysical sources of high energy emission, such as black hole
magnetospheres, superstrongly magnetized neutron stars (magnetars), and
probably relativistic jets in Active Galactic Nuclei and Gamma Ray Bursts
involve relativistically magnetically dominated plasma. In such plasma the
energy density of magnetic field greatly exceeds the thermal and the rest mass
energy density of particles. Therefore the magnetic field is the main reservoir
of energy and its dissipation may power the bursting emission from these
sources, in close analogy to Solar flares. One of the principal dissipative
instabilities that may lead to release of magnetic energy is the tearing
instability. In this paper we study, both analytically and numerically, the
development of tearing instability in relativistically magnetically-dominated
plasma using the framework of resistive magnetodynamics. We confirm and
elucidate the previously obtained result on the growth rate of the tearing
mode: the shortest growth time is the same as in the case of classical
non-relativistic MHD, namely $\tau =\sqrt{\tau_a \tau_d}$ where $\tau_a$ is the
\Alfven crossing time and $\tau_d$ is the resistive time of a current layer.",2006-06-15T11:54:15Z
"Second Core Formation and High Speed Jets: Resistive MHD Nested Grid
  Simulations","The stellar core formation and high speed jets driven by the formed core are
studied by using three-dimensional resistive MHD nested grid simulations.
Starting with a Bonnor-Ebert isothermal cloud rotating in a uniform magnetic
field, we calculate the cloud evolution from the molecular cloud core (n = 10^6
cm^-3, r_c = 4.6 times 10^4 AU) to the stellar core (n \simeq 10^23 cm^-3, r_c
\simeq 1 solar radius). We resolve cloud structure over 7 orders of magnitude
in spatial extent and over 17 orders of magnitude in density contrast. For
comparison, we calculate two models: resistive and ideal MHD models. Both
models have the same initial condition, but the former includes dissipation
process of magnetic field while the latter does not. The magnetic fluxes in
resistive MHD model are extracted from the first core during 10^12 cm^-3 < n <
10^16 cm^-3 by Ohmic dissipation. Magnetic flux density of the formed stellar
core (n \simeq 10^20 cm^-3) in resistive MHD model is two orders of magnitude
smaller than that in ideal MHD model. Since magnetic braking is less effective
in resistive MHD model, rapidly rotating stellar core (the second core) is
formed. After stellar core formation, the magnetic field of the core is largely
amplified both by magneto-rotational instability and the shearing motion
between the stellar core and ambient medium. As a consequence, high speed
(simeq 45 km,s^-1) jets are driven by the second core, which results in strong
mass ejection. A cocoon-like structure around the second core also forms with
clear bow shocks.",2006-03-17T04:43:14Z
Kinematics of Protostellar Objects in the $ρ$ Ophiuchus A Region,"We present the detection of infall, rotation and outflow kinematic signatures
towards both a protostellar source, VLA 1623 and what was initially thought to
be a pre-protostellar core, SM1N, in the rho-Ophiuchus A region. The kinematic
signatures of early star formation were detected in the dense molecular gas
surrounding the embedded sources using high signal-to-noise millimeter and
submillimeter data. Centroid velocity maps made with HCO+ J=4->3 and J=1->0
line emission exhibit the blue bulge signature of infall, which is predicted to
be seen when infall motion dominates over rotational motion. Further evidence
for infalling gas is found in the HCO+ blue asymmetric line profiles and red
asymmetric opacity profiles. We also performed CO J=3->2 and J=1->0
observations to determine the direction, orientation, and extent of molecular
outflows, and report the discovery of a new bipolar outflow possibly driven by
SM1N.",2006-05-05T16:01:38Z
A toy model of a fake inflation,"Discontinuities in non linear field theories propagate through null geodesics
in an effective metric that depends on its dynamics and on the background
geometry. Once information of the geometry of the universe comes mostly from
photons, one should carefully analyze the effects of possible nonlinearities on
Electrodynamics in the cosmic geometry. Such phenomenon of induced metric is
rather general and may occurs for any nonlinear theory independently of its
spin properties. We limit our analysis here to the simplest case of non linear
scalar field. We show that a class of theories that have been analyzed in the
literature, having regular configuration in the Minkowski space-time background
is such that the field propagates like free waves in an effective deSitter
geometry. The observation of these waves would led us to infer, erroneously,
that we live in a deSitter universe.",2006-04-21T19:40:45Z
Advances in infrared and imaging fibres for astronomical instrumentation,"Optical fibres have already played a huge part in ground based astronomical
instrumentation, however, with the revolution in photonics currently taking
place new fibre technologies and integrated optical devices are likely to have
a profound impact on the way we manipulate light in the future. The
Anglo-Australian Observatory, along with partners at the Optical Fibre
Technology Centre of the University of Sydney, is investigating some of the
developing technologies as part of our Astrophotonics programme. In this paper
we discuss the advances that have been made with infrared transmitting fibre,
both conventional and microstructured, in particular those based on flouride
glasses. Flouride glasses have a particularly wide transparent region from the
UV through to around 7um, whereas silica fibres, commonly used in astronomy,
only transmit out to about 2um. We discuss the impact of advances in fibre
manufacture that have greatly improved the optical, chemical resistance and
physical properties of the flouride fibres. We also present some encouraging
initial test results for a modern imaging fibre bundle and imaging fibre taper.",2006-06-13T06:56:17Z
TeV lightcurve of PSR B1259-63/SS2883,"The inverse Compton scattering of ultrarelativistic electrons accelerated at
the pulsar wind termination shock is believed to be responsible for TeV
gamma-ray signal recently reported from the binary system PSR B1259-63/SS2883.
While this process can explain the energy spectrum of the observed TeV
emission, the detected gamma-ray fluxes do not agree with the published
theoretical predictions of the TeV lightcurve. The main objective of this paper
is to show that the HESS results can be explained, under certain reasonable
assumptions, by inverse Compton scenarios of gamma-ray production in the
system. In this paper we study evolution of the energy spectra of relativistic
electrons under different assumptions about the acceleration and energy-loss
rates of electrons, and the impact of these processes on the lightcurve of IC
gamma-rays. We demonstrate that the observed TeV lightcurve can be explained
(i) by adiabatic losses which dominate over the entire trajectory of the pulsar
with a significant increase towards the periastron, or (ii) by the sub-TeV
cutoffs in the energy spectra of electrons due to the enhanced rate of Compton
losses close to the periastron. The Compton deceleration of the pulsar wind
contributes to the decrease of the nonthermal power released in the accelerated
electrons, and thus to the reduction of the IC and synchrotron components of
radiation close to the periastron. Although this effect alone cannot explain
the observed lightcurves, the Comptonization of the pulsar wind leads to the
formation of gamma-radiation with a line-type energy spectrum. While the HESS
data already constrain the Lorentz factor of the wind, $\Gamma \le 10^6$,
future observations of this object with GLAST should allow a deep probe of the
wind Lorentz factor in the range between $10^4$ and $10^6$.",2006-05-26T13:15:09Z
"The oxygen abundance calibrations and N/O abundance ratios of ~40,000
  SDSS star-forming galaxies","Using a large sample of 38,478 star-forming galaxies selected from the Second
Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey database (SDSS-DR2), we derive
analytical calibrations for oxygen abundances from several
metallicity-sensitive emission-line ratios: [N II]/H_alpha, [O III]/[N II], [N
II]/[O II], [N II]/[S II], [S II]/H_alpha, and [O III]/H_beta. This consistent
set of strong-line oxygen abundance calibrations will be useful for future
abundance studies. Among these calibrations, [N II]/[O II] is the best for
metal-rich galaxies due to its independence on ionization parameter and low
scatter. Dust extinction must be considered properly at first. These
calibrations are more suitable for metal-rich galaxies (8.4<12+log(O/H)<9.3),
and for the nuclear regions of galaxies. The observed relations are consistent
with those expected from the photoionization models of Kewley & Dopita (2002).
However, most of the observational data spread in a range of ionization
parameter q from 1*10^7 to 8*10^7 cm s^{-1}, corresponding to logU= -3.5 to
-2.5, narrower than that suggested by the models. We also estimate the (N/O)
abundance ratios of this large sample of galaxies, and these are consistent
with the combination of a ""primary"" and a dominant ""secondary"" components of
nitrogen.",2006-07-05T14:28:59Z
"The nucleosynthesis of Al26 and Fe60 in solar metallicity stars
  extending in mass from 11 to 120 Msun: the hydrostatic and explosive
  contributions","We present the \nuk{Al}{26} and \nuk{Fe}{60} yields produced by a generation
of solar metallicity stars ranging in mass between 11 and 120\msun. We discuss
the production sites of these $\gamma$ ray emitters and quantify the relative
contributions of the various components. More specifically we provide the
separate contribution of the wind, the C convective shell and the explosive
Ne/C burning to the total \nuk{Al}{26} yield per each stellar model in our
grid. We provide the contributions of the He convective shell, the C convective
shell and the explosive Ne/C burning to the \nuk{Fe}{60} yield as well. From
these computations we conclude that, at variance with current beliefs,
\nuk{Al}{26} is mainly produced by the explosive C/Ne burning over most of the
mass interval presently analyzed while \nuk{Fe}{60} is mainly produced by the C
convective shell and the He convective shell.",2006-04-13T11:22:50Z
Shock-cloud interaction in the Vela SNR II. Hydrodynamic model,"In the framework of the study of the X-ray and optical emission in supernova
remnants we focus on an isolated X-ray knot in the northern rim of the Vela SNR
(Vela FilD), whose X-ray emission has been studied and discussed in Paper I. We
aim at understanding the physical origin of the X-ray and optical emission in
FilD, at understanding the role of the different physical processes at work,
and at obtaining a key for the interpretation of future X-ray observations of
SNRs. To this end we have pursued an accurate ``forward'' modeling of the
interaction of the Vela SNR shock with an ISM cloud. We perform hydrodynamic
simulations and we directly compare the observables synthesized from the
simulations with the data. We explore four different model setups, choosing the
values of the physical parameters on the basis of our preliminary analysis of
the X-ray data. We synthesize X-ray emission maps and spectra filtered through
the XMM-Newton EPIC-MOS instrumental response. The impact of a shock front at 6
million Kelvin on an elliptical cloud 30 times denser than the ambient medium
describes well the shock-cloud interaction processes in the Vela FilD region in
terms of spectral properties and morphology of the X-ray and optical emission.
The bulk of the X-ray emission in the FilD knot originates in the cloud
material heated by the transmitted shock front, but significant X-ray emission
is also associated to the cloud material, which evaporates, as an effect of
thermal conduction, in the intercloud medium. The physical origin of the FilD
optical emission is associated to thermal instabilities. In the FilD knot the
X-ray emission associated to the reflected shock front is negligible.",2006-08-02T15:06:05Z
Redshifted 21 Centimeter Emission from Minihalos Before Reionization,"Before reionization, the intergalactic medium (IGM) may have been
sufficiently cold for low-mass ""minihalos"" to condense out of the gas and
subsequently affect reionization. Previous work has shown that minihalos
generate reasonably large 21 cm fluctuations. Here we consider this signal in
its proper cosmological context and show that isolating minihalos from the rest
of the IGM is extremely difficult. Using the well-known halo model, we compute
the power spectrum of 21 cm fluctuations from minihalos and show that the
signal decreases rapidly as feedback increases the Jeans mass. We then show
that even a small Lyman-alpha background increases the 21 cm fluctuations of
the diffuse IGM well beyond those of the minihalos; because the mass fraction
in the IGM is much larger, minihalos will lie buried within the IGM signal. The
distinctive signatures of non-linear bias and minihalo structure emerge only at
much smaller scales, well beyond the resolution of any upcoming instruments.
Using simple, but representative, reionization histories, we then show that the
required Lyman-alpha background level is most likely achieved at z>15, while
minihalos are still rare, so that they are almost always degenerate with the
diffuse IGM.",2006-04-04T20:24:57Z
Chandra and XMM-Newton Observations of a Group of Galaxies HCG 62,"We present results from Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of the bright
group of galaxies HCG 62. There are two cavities at about 30'' northeast and
20'' southwest of the central galaxy in the Chandra image. The energy spectrum
shows no significant change in the cavity compared with that in the surrounding
region. The radial X-ray profile is described by a sum of 3-beta components
with core radii about 2, 10, and 160 kpc, respectively. We studied radial
distributions of temperature and metal abundance with joint spectral fit for
the Chandra and XMM-Newton data, and two temperatures were required in the
inner r< 2' (35 kpc) region. The sharp drop of temperature at r about 5'
implies the gravitational mass density even lower than the gas density,
suggesting the gas may not be in hydrostatic equilibrium. Fe and Si abundances
are 1-2 solar at the center and drop to about 0.1 solar at r about 10'. O
abundance is less than 0.5 solar and shows a flatter profile. Observed metal
distribution supports the view that iron and silicon are produced by type Ia
supernova in the central galaxy, while galactic winds by type II supernova have
caused wide distribution of oxygen. The supporting mechanism of the cavity is
discussed. Pressure for the sum of electrons and magnetic field is too low to
displace the hot group gas, and the required pressure due to high energy
protons are nearly 700 times higher than the electron pressure. This leaves the
origin of the cavities a puzzle, and we discuss other possible origins of the
cavities.",2006-07-08T08:57:00Z
Escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxies at z=0--6,"The escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxies is a crucial quantity
controlling the cosmic ionizing background radiation and the reionization.
Various estimates of this parameter can be obtained in the redshift range,
z=0--6, either from direct observations or from the observed ionizing
background intensities. We compare them homogeneously in terms of the observed
flux density ratio of ionizing ($\sim900$ \AA rest-frame) to non-ionizing
ultraviolet ($\sim1500$ \AA rest-frame) corrected for the intergalactic
absorption. The escape fraction is found to increase by an order of magnitude,
from a value less than 0.01 at $z\la1$ to about 0.1 at $z\ga4$.",2006-05-20T03:46:38Z
Implications of a Running Spectral Index for Slow Roll Inflation,"We analyze the weak (2 sigma) evidence for a running spectral index seen in
the three-year WMAP dataset and its implications for single field, slow roll
inflation. We assume that the running is comparable to the central value found
from the WMAP data analysis, and use the Hubble Slow Roll formalism to follow
the evolution of the slow roll parameters. For all parameter choices consistent
with a large, negative running, single field, slow roll inflation lasts less
than 30 efolds after CMB scales leave the horizon. Thus, a definitive
observation of a large negative running would imply that any inflationary phase
requires multiple fields or the breakdown of slow roll. Alternatively, if
single field, slow roll inflation is sources the primordial fluctuations, we
can expect the observed running to move much closer to zero as the CMB is
measured more accurately at small angular scales.",2006-04-10T20:00:04Z
"The surprising magnetic topology of tauSco: fossil remnant or dynamo
  output?","We report the discovery of a medium-strength (~0.5kG) magnetic field on the
young, massive star tauSco (B0.2V), which becomes the third-hottest magnetic
star known. Circularly polarized Zeeman signatures are clearly detected in
observations collected mostly with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter, recently
installed on the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope; temporal variability is
also clearly established in the polarimetry, and can be unambiguously
attributed to rotational modulation with a period close to 41d. Archival UV
spectra confirm that this modulation repeats over timescales of decades.
  By reconstructing the large-scale structure of its magnetic topology, we find
that the magnetic structure is unusually complex for a hot star. The surface
topology is dominated by a potential field, although a moderate toroidal
component is probably present. We fail to detect intrinsic temporal variability
of the magnetic structure over the 1.5-yr period of our spectropolarimetric
observations (in agreement with the stable temporal variations of the UV
spectra), and infer that any differential surface rotation must be very small.
  The topology of the extended magnetic field that we derive from the
photospheric magnetic maps is also more complex than a global dipole, and
features in particular a significantly warped torus of closed magnetic loops
encircling the star (tilted at about 90deg to the rotation axis), with
additional, smaller, networks of closed field lines. This topology appears to
be consistent with the exceptional Xray properties of tauSco and also provides
a natural explanation of the variability observed in wind-formed UV lines. We
conclude that its magnetic field is most probably a fossil remnant from the
star-formation stage.",2006-06-07T15:47:55Z
Bulk viscosity of Mixed nucleon-hyperon-quark Matter in Neutron stars,"We calculate the coefficient of bulk viscosity by considering the
non-leptonic weak interactions in the cores of hybrid stars with both hyperons
and quarks. We first determine the dependence of the production rate of
neutrons on the reaction rate of quarks in the non-leptonic processes, that is
$\Gamma_{n}=K_{s}\Gamma_{s}+\Gamma_{\Lambda}+2\Gamma_{\Sigma^{-}}$. The
conversion rate, $K_{s}$ in our scenario is a complicated function of baryon
number density. We also consider medium effect of quark matter on bulk
viscosity. Using these results, we estimate the limiting rotation of the hybrid
stars, which may suppress the r-mode instability more effectively. Hybrid stars
should be the candidates for the extremely rapid rotators .",2006-07-04T14:07:22Z
Donut: measuring optical aberrations from a single extra-focal image,"We propose a practical method to calculate Zernike aberrations from analysis
of a single long-exposure defocused stellar image. It consists in fitting the
aberration coefficients and seeing blur directly to a realistic image binned
into detector pixels. This ""donut"" method is different from curvature sensing
in that it does not make the usual approximation of linearity. We calculate the
sensitivity of this technique to detector and photon noise and determine
optimal parameters for some representative cases. Aliasing of high-order
un-modeled aberrations is evaluated and shown to be similar to a low-order
Shack-Hartmann sensor. The method has been tested with real data from the SOAR
and Blanco 4m telescopes.",2006-06-15T23:14:14Z
The HI content of E+A galaxies,"We present deep single-dish HI observations of a sample of six nearby E+A
galaxies (0.05<z<0.1). A non-negligible fraction of a local sample of E+As are
detected in HI. In four galaxies, we have detected up to a few times 10^9 Msun
of neutral gas. These E+A galaxies are almost as gas-rich as spiral galaxies
with comparable luminosities. There appears to exist no direct correlation
between the amount of HI present in an E+A galaxy and its star-formation rate
as traced by radio continuum emission. Moreover, the end of the starburst does
not necessarily require the complete exhaustion of the neutral gas reservoir.
Most likely, an intense burst of star formation consumed the dense molecular
clouds, which are the sites of massive star formation. This effectively stops
star formation, even though copious amounts of diffuse neutral gas remain. The
remaining HI reservoir may eventually lead to further episodes of star
formation. This may indicate that some E+As are observed in the inactive phase
of the star-formation duty cycle.",2006-04-27T11:22:07Z
Discovery of 14 radio pulsars in a survey of the Magellanic Clouds,"A systematic survey of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds for radio
pulsars using the Parkes radio telescope and the 20-cm multibeam receiver has
resulted in the discovery of 14 pulsars and the redetection of five of the
eight previously known spin-powered pulsars believed to lie in the Magellanic
Clouds. Of the 14 new discoveries, 12 are believed to lie within Clouds, three
in the Small Cloud and nine in the Large Cloud, bringing the total number of
known spin-powered pulsars in the Clouds to 20. Averaged over all positions
within the survey area, the survey had a limiting flux density of about 0.12
mJy. Observed dispersion measures suggest that the mean free electron density
in the Magellanic Clouds is similar to that in the disk of our Galaxy. The
observed radio luminosities have little or no dependence on pulsar period or
characteristic age and the differential luminosity function is consistent with
a power-law slope of -1 as is observed for Galactic pulsars.",2006-04-20T03:21:55Z
Hubble Imaging Excludes Cosmic String Lens,"The galaxy image pair CSL-1 has been a leading candidate for a cosmic string
lens. High quality imaging data from the Hubble Space Telescope presented here
show that it is not a lens but a pair of galaxies. The galaxies show different
orientations of their principal axes, not consistent with any lens model. We
present a new direct test of the straight-string lens model, using a displaced
difference of the image from itself to exclude CSL-1 at high confidence.",2006-03-30T21:27:23Z
"Structure of the hot object in the symbiotic prototype Z And during its
  2000-03 active phase","Aims: To investigate structure of the hot object in the symbiotic prototype Z
And during its major 2000-03 active phase. Methods: Analysis of the far
ultraviolet, optical low- and high-resolution spectroscopy and UBVR photometry.
Reconstruction of the spectral energy distribution (SED) during the outburst.
The Raman scattering process. Results: At the initial stages of the outburst
the hot object was characterized by the two-temperature spectrum (a warm
stellar radiation and a strong nebular emission) with signatures of a
mass-outflow at moderate (100-200 km/s) and very high (1000-2000 km/s)
velocities. The corresponding structure of the hot object consists of an
optically thick, slowly-expanding disk-like material encompassing the accretor
at the orbital plane and a fast optically thin wind over the remainder of the
star. A striking similarity of [FeVII]6087 and Raman 6825 profiles at/after the
dilution of the disk suggested their origin within the interaction zone where
the winds from the binary components collide.",2006-03-27T12:33:18Z
"A weak lensing estimate from GEMS of the virial to stellar mass ratio in
  massive galaxies to z~0.8","We present constraints on the evolution of the virial to stellar mass ratio
of galaxies with high stellar masses in the redshift range 0.2<z<0.8, by
comparing weak lensing measurements of virial mass M_vir to estimates of
stellar mass M_star from COMBO-17. For a complete sample of galaxies with
log(M_star/ M_\odot) > 10.5, where the majority show an early-type morphology,
we find that the virial mass to stellar mass ratio is given by M_vir/M_star =
53^{+13}_{-16}. Assuming a baryon fraction from the concordance cosmology, this
corresponds to a stellar fraction of baryons in massive galaxies of
Omega_b^*/\Omega_b = 0.10 +/- 0.03. Analysing the galaxy sample in different
redshift slices, we find little or no evolution in the virial to stellar mass
ratio, and place an upper limit of ~2.5 on the growth of massive galaxies
through the conversion of gas into stars from z=0.8 to the present day.",2006-06-16T23:02:48Z
"Unconstrained Astrometric Orbits for Hipparcos Stars with Stochastic
  Solutions","A considerable number of astrometric binaries whose positions on the sky do
not obey the standard model of mean position, parallax and linear proper
motion, were observed by the Hipparcos satellite. Some of them remain
non-discovered, and their observational data have not been properly processed
with the more adequate astrometric model that includes nonlinear orbital
motion. We develop an automated algorithm based on ""genetic optimization"", to
solve the orbital fitting problem with no prior information about the orbital
elements is available (from, e.g., spectroscopic data or radial velocity
monitoring). We test this method on Hipparcos stars with known orbital
solutions in the catalog, and further apply it to stars with stochastic
solutions, which may be unresolved binaries. At a confidence level of 99%,
orbital fits are obtained for 65 stars, most of which have not been known as
binary. A few of the new probable binaries with A-type primaries with periods
444-2015 d are chemically peculiar stars, including Ap and \lambda Boo type.
The anomalous spectra of these stars are explained as admixture of the light
from the unresolved, sufficiently bright and massive companions. We estimate
the apparent orbits of four stars which have been identified as members of the
300 Myr-old UMa kinematic group. Another four new nearby binaries may include
low-mass M-type or brown dwarf companions. Similar astrometric models and
algorithms can be used for binary stars and planet hosts observed by SIM
PlanetQuest and Gaia.",2006-06-13T04:47:14Z
Global Dynamics in Galactic Triaxial Systems I,"In this paper we present a theoretical analysis of the global dynamics in a
triaxial galactic system using a 3D integrable Hamiltonian as a simple
representation. We include a thorough discussion on the effect of adding a
generic non--integrable perturbation to the global dynamics of the system. We
adopt the triaxial Stackel Hamiltonian as the integrable model and compute its
resonance structure in order to understand its global dynamics when a
perturbation is introduced. Also do we take profit of this example in order to
provide a theoretical discussion about diffussive processes taking place in
phase space.",2006-04-21T14:34:09Z
"Old open clusters as key tracers of Galactic chemical evolution. I. Fe
  abundances in NGC 2660, NGC 3960, and Berkeley 32","We obtained high-resolution UVES/FLAMES observations of a sample of nine old
open clusters spanning a wide range of ages and Galactocentric radii. The goal
of the project is to investigate the radial metallicity gradient in the disk,
as well as the abundance of key elements (alpha and Fe-peak elements). In this
paper we present the results for the metallicity of three clusters: NGC 2660
(age ~1 Gyr, Galactocentric distance of 8.68 kpc), NGC 3960 (~ 1 Gyr, 7.80
kpc), and Be 32 (~6-7 Gyr, 11.30 kpc). For Be 32 and NGC 2660, our study
provides the first metallicity determination based on high-resolution spectra.
We performed equivalent width analysis with the spectral code MOOG, which
allows us to define a metallicity scale and build a homogeneous sample. We find
that NGC 3960 and NGC 2660 have a metallicity that is very close to solar
([Fe/H]=+0.02 and +0.04, respectively), while the older Be 32 turns out to have
[Fe/H]=$-$0.29.",2006-07-19T09:51:33Z
"They Came From the Deep in the Supernova: The Origin of TiC and Metal
  Subgrains in Presolar Graphite Grains","A new formation scenario for TiC and Fe,Ni-metal inclusions in presolar
graphite grains of supernova origin is described. The mineralogy and chemistry
require condensation of (Fe,Ni)-titanides from Fe, Ni, and Ti-rich gaseous
ejecta, subsequent carburization to make TiC and metal, and encapsulation into
graphite. Titanides only condense if Si is depleted relative to heavier mass
elements, which requires alpha-rich freeze-out and a deep mass-cut for the
supernova ejecta. This Si-poor core material must remain unmixed with other
supernova zones until the titanides condensed. This can be accomplished by
transport of core ejecta in bipolar jets through the major expanding supernova
zone ejecta. If the jets stall in regions dominated by C-rich ejecta such as
C-He zone where graphite condenses, thermochemically favored in situ
carburization of the titanides - either before or during encapsulation into
condensing graphite - leads to a TiC and metal composite. This scenario agrees
with theoretical models and observations of asymmetric core collapse in
supernovae that are associated with bipolar jets loaded with iron-peak
elements.",2006-06-27T22:54:21Z
"The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. Variable Baseline
  Microlensing Events in the Galactic Bulge","We present the first systematic search for microlensing events with
variability in their baselines using data from the third phase of the Optical
Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE-III). A total of 137 candidates (88 new)
was discovered toward the Galactic bulge. Among these, 21 have periodic
oscillations in their baselines, 111 are irregular variables and 5 are
potential long period detached eclipsing binaries. This is about 10% of the
total number of constant baseline events. They are hence quite common and can
be regarded as a new type of exotic events, which allow the determination of
extra parameters of the events. We show that microlensing of variable stars may
allow us to break the degeneracy between the blending parameter and
magnification. We note that in some cases variability hidden in the baseline
due to strong blending may be revealed in highly magnified events and resemble
other exotic microlensing behavior, including planetary deviation. A new system
(VEWS) for detecting ongoing variable baseline microlensing events is
presented.",2006-07-07T11:22:05Z
"Measuring the Average Evolution of Luminous Galaxies at z<3: The
  Rest-frame Optical Luminosity Density, Spectral Energy Distribution, and
  Stellar Mass Density","(Abridged) We present the evolution of the volume averaged properties of the
rest-frame optically luminous galaxy population to z~3, determined from four
disjoint deep fields with optical to near-infrared wavelength coverage. We
select galaxies above a rest-frame V-band luminosity of 3x10^10 Lsol and
characterize their rest-frame UV through optical properties via the mean
spectral energy distribution (SED). To measure evolution we apply the same
selection criteria to a sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
and COMBO-17. The mean rest-frame 2200Ang through V-band SED becomes steadily
bluer with increasing redshift but at z<3 the mean SED falls within the range
defined by ``normal'' galaxies in the nearby Universe. We measure stellar
mass-to-light ratios (Mstar/L) by fitting models to the rest-frame UV-optical
SEDs and derive the stellar mass density. The stellar mass density in luminous
galaxies has increased by a factor of 3.5-7.9 from z=3 to z=0.1, including
field-to-field variance uncertainties. After correcting to total, the measured
mass densities at z<2 lie below the integral of the star formation rate (SFR)
density as a function of redshift as derived from UV selected samples. This may
indicate a systematic error in the mass densities or SFR(z) estimates. We find
large discrepancies between recent model predictions for the evolution of the
mass density and our results, even when our observational selection is applied
to the models. Finally we determine that Distant Red Galaxies (selected to have
J_s - K_s>2.3) in our LV selected samples contribute 30% and 64% of the stellar
mass budget at z~2 and z~ 2.8 respectively. These galaxies are largely absent
from UV surveys and this result highlights the need for mass selection of high
redshift galaxies.",2006-06-21T20:23:07Z
"Mass segregation in rich LMC clusters from modelling of deep HST
  colour-magnitude diagrams","We used the deep colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of five rich LMC clusters
(NGC1805, 1818, 1831, 1868, and Hodge14) observed with HST/WFPC2 to derive
their present day mass function (PDMF) and its variation with position within
the cluster. The PDMF was parameterized as a power law in the available
main-sequence mass range of each cluster, typically 0.9 <~ m/M_sun <~ 2.5; its
slope was determined at different positions spanning from the very centre out
to several core radii. The CMDs in the central regions of the clusters were
carefully studied earlier, resulting in accurate age, metallicity, distance
modulus, and reddening values. The slope alpha (where Salpeter is 2.35) was
determined in annuli by following two distinct methods: 1) a power law fit to
the PDMF obtained from the systemic luminosity function (LF); 2) a statistical
comparison between observed and model CMDs. In all clusters, significant mass
segregation is found from the positional dependence of the PDMF slope: alpha <~
1.8 for R <= 1.0 R_core and alpha ~ Salpeter inside R=2~3 R_core (except for
Hodge 14, where alpha ~ Salpeter for R ~ 4 R_core). The results are robust in
the sense that they hold true for both methods used. The CMD method reveals
that unresolved binaries flatten the PDMF obtained form the systemic LF, but
this effect is smaller than the uncertainties in the alpha determination. For
each cluster we estimated dynamical ages inside the core and for the entire
system. In both cases we found a trend in the sense that older clusters have
flatter PDMF, consistent with a dynamical mass segregation and stellar
evaporation.",2006-04-28T19:35:45Z
The detection of M-dwarf UV flare events in the GALEX data archives,"We present the preliminary results from implementing a new software tool that
enables inspection of time-tagged photon data for the astronomical sources
contained within individual GALEX ultraviolet images of the sky. We have
inspected the photon data contained within 1802 GALEX images to reveal rapid,
short-term (<500 sec) UV source variability in the form of stellar flares. The
mean associated change in NUV magnitude due to this flaring activity is
2.7+/-0.3 mag. A list of 49 new UV variable-star candidates is presented,
together with their associated Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometric
magnitudes. From these data we can associate the main source of these UV flare
events with magnetic activity on M-dwarf stars. Photometric parallaxes have
been determined for 32 of these sources, placing them at distances ranging from
approximately 25 to 1000pc. The average UV flare energy for these flare events
is 2.5E30 ergs, which is of a similar energy to that of U-band, X-ray and EUV
flares observed on many local M-dwarf stars. We have found that stars of
classes M0 to M5 flare with energies spanning a far larger range and with an
energy approximately 5 times greater than those of later (M6 to M8) spectral
type.",2006-05-12T19:32:15Z
"Semi-empirical analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies: IV. A
  nature via nurture scenario for galaxy evolution","We investigate the environmental dependence of stellar population properties
of galaxies in the local universe. Physical quantities related to the stellar
content of galaxies are derived from a spectral synthesis method applied to a
volume-limited sample containing more than 60 thousand galaxies extracted from
the DR4 of the SDSS. Mean stellar ages, mean stellar metallicities and stellar
masses are obtained from this method and used to characterise the stellar
populations of galaxies. The environment is defined by the projected local
galaxy density estimated from a nearest neighbour approach. We recover the star
formation--density relation in terms of the mean light-weighted stellar age,
which is strongly correlated with star formation parameters derived from \Ha.
We find that the age--density relation is distinct when we divide galaxies
according to luminosity or stellar mass. The relation is remarkable for
galaxies in all bins of luminosity. On the other hand, only for an intermediate
stellar mass interval (associated to a transition in galaxy properties) the
relation shows a change in galaxy properties with environment. Such distinct
behaviours are associated to the large stellar masses of galaxies with the same
luminosity in high-density environments. In addition, the well known star
formation--density relation results from the prevalence of massive systems in
high-density environments, independently of galaxy luminosity, with the
additional observed downsizing in galaxy formation, in which the star formation
is shifted from massive galaxies at early times to low-mass galaxies as the
universe evolves. Our results support that a natural path for galaxy evolution
proceeds via a nurture way, in the sense that galaxy evolution is accelerated
in denser environments, that took place mainly at high-redshifts.",2006-04-04T14:38:04Z
The Hydrogen Burning Turn-off of RS Ophiuchi 2006,"We report a coordinated multi-band photometry of the RS Oph 2006 outburst and
highlight the emission line free y-band photometry that shows a mid-plateau
phase at y ~ 10.2 mag from day 40 to day 75 after the discovery followed by a
sharp drop of the final decline. Such mid-plateau phases are observed in other
two recurrent novae, U Sco and CI Aql, and are interpreted as a bright disk
irradiated by the white dwarf. We have calculated theoretical light curves
based on the optically thick wind theory and have reproduced the observed light
curves including the mid-plateau phase and the final sharp decline. This final
decline is identified with the end of steady hydrogen shell-burning, which
turned out the day ~80. This turnoff date is consistent with the end of a
supersoft X-ray phase observed with Swift. Our model suggests a white dwarf
mass of 1.35 \pm 0.01 M_\sun, which indicates that RS Oph is a progenitor of
Type Ia supernovae. We strongly recommend the y-filter observation of novae to
detect both the presence of a disk and the hydrogen burning turn-off.",2006-07-28T16:46:17Z
"The Hard X-ray Spectral Slope as an Accretion-Rate Indicator in
  Radio-Quiet Active Galactic Nuclei","We present new XMM-Newton observations of two luminous and high
accretion-rate radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z~2. Together with
archival X-ray and rest-frame optical spectra of three sources with similar
properties as well as 25 moderate-luminosity radio-quiet AGNs at z<0.5, we
investigate, for the first time, the dependence of the hard (>~2 keV) X-ray
power-law photon index on the broad H_beta emission-line width and on the
accretion rate across ~3 orders of magnitude in AGN luminosity. Provided the
accretion rates of the five luminous sources can be estimated by extrapolating
the well-known broad-line region size-luminosity relation to high luminosities,
we find that the photon indices of these sources, while consistent with those
expected from their accretion rates, are significantly higher than expected
from the widths of their H_beta lines. We argue that, within the limits of our
sample, the hard-X-ray photon index depends primarily on the accretion rate.",2006-06-15T20:00:07Z
"The origin of the hot metal-poor gas in NGC1291: Testing the hypothesis
  of gas dynamics as the cause of the gas heating","In this paper we test the idea that the low-metallicity hot gas in the centre
of NGC 1291 is heated via a dynamical process. In this scenario, the gas from
the outer gas-rich ring loses energy through bar-driven shocks and falls to the
centre. Heating of the gas to X-ray temperatures comes from the high velocity
that it reaches ($\approx$ 700 \kms) as it falls to the bottom of the potential
well. This would explain why the stellar metallicity in the bulge region is
around solar while the hot gas metallicity is around 0.1 solar. We carried out
an observational test to check this hypothesis by measuring the metallicity of
HII regions in the outer ring to check whether they matched the hot gas
metallicity. For this purpose we obtained medium resolution long slit
spectroscopy with FORS1 on the ESO VLT at Paranal and obtained the
metallicities using emission line ratio diagnostics. The obtained metallicities
are compatible with the bulge stellar metallicities but very different from the
hot-gas metallicity. However, when comparing the different time-scales, the gas
in the ring had time enough to get enriched through stellar processes,
therefore we cannot rule out the dynamical mechanism as the heating process of
the gas. However, the blue colours of the outer ring and the dust structures in
the bar region could suggest that the origin of the X-ray hot gas is due to the
infall of material from further out.",2006-04-18T16:39:54Z
"The Stellar Masses and Star Formation Histories of Galaxies at z ~ 6:
  Constraints from Spitzer Observations in the Great Observatories Origins Deep
  Survey","Using the deep Spitzer IRAC observations of the Great Observatories Origins
Deep Survey (GOODS), we study the stellar masses and star formation histories
of galaxies at z ~ 6. Our study is based on the i-band dropout sample selected
from the GOODS southern and northern fields (~ 330 arcmin^2 in total), several
of which already have spectroscopic confirmations. In total, we derive stellar
masses for 53 i-band dropouts that have robust IRAC detections. These galaxies
have typical stellar masses of ~ 1e10 M_sun and typical ages of a couple of
hundred million years, consistent with earlier results based on a smaller
sample of z ~ 6 galaxies in the HUDF. We also study 79 i-band dropouts that are
invisible in the IRAC data and find that they are typically less massive by a
factor of ten. Based on our mass estimates, we derive a lower limit to the
global stellar mass density at z ~ 6. Considering the range of systematic
uncertainties in the derived stellar masses, this lower limit is 1.1--6.7e6
M_sun/Mpc^3 (co-moving), which is 0.2--1.1% of the present-day value. The
prospect of detecting the progenitors of the most massive galaxies at yet
higher redshifts is explored: a deep, wide-field near-IR survey using our
current technology could possibly result in positive detections at z > 7. We
also investigate the implication of our results for reionzation, and find that
the progenitors of the galaxies comparable to those in our sample, even in the
most optimized (probably unrealistic) scenario, cannot sustain the reionization
for a period longer than ~ 2 million years. Thus most of the photons required
for reionization must have been provided by other sources, such as the
progenitors of the dwarf galaxies that are far below our current detection
capability. (Abridged)",2006-04-26T20:27:51Z
VW Hyi: optical spectroscopy and Doppler tomography,"We present high quality optical spectroscopy of the SU UMa-subtype dwarf
nova, VW Hyi taken while the system was in quiescence. An S-wave is executed by
the emission cores of the Hydrogen Balmer lines and by the emission lines of He
I, Ca II, Fe II and He II. Using Doppler tomography we show it originates in
the accretion stream-disc impact region. The He II emission is strongly
phase-dependent, suggesting it originates exclusively within a hot cavity at
the initial impact. We map the ionization structure of the stream-disc
interaction region. One possible interpretation of this is that the Balmer
hotspot lies downstream of the He II hotspot in the outer accretion disc, with
the He I and Ca II hotspots at intermediate locations between the two. This
suggests that Balmer emission is suppressed until material has cooled somewhat
downstream of the impact site and is able to recombine. We favour a phase
offset of 0.15+/-0.04 between the photometric ephemeris and inferior
conjunction of the mass donor. The white dwarf contributes significantly to the
optical continuum, with broad Balmer absorption and narrow Mg II 4481
absorption clearly apparent. This latter feature yields the gravitational
redshift: v_grav=38+/-21 km s^-1, so M_1=0.71+0.18-0.26 M_sun. This implies
M_2=0.11 +/- 0.03 M_sun and hence the donor is not a brown dwarf. A prominent
Balmer jump is also observed. We note that the previously accepted system
parameters for both VW Hyi and WX Hyi incoporate an algebraic error, and we
provide a recalculated M_1(q) plane for WX Hyi.",2006-03-29T18:43:44Z
A simple model for the size-evolution of elliptical galaxies,"We use semi-analytical modelling of galaxy formation to predict the
redshift-size-evolution of elliptical galaxies. Using a simple model in which
relative sizes of elliptical galaxies of a given mass correlate with the
fraction of stars formed in a star burst during a major merger event, we are
able to reproduce the observed size redshif t evolution. The size evolution is
a result of the amount of cold gas available during the major merger. Mergers
at high redshifts are gas-rich and produce ellipticals with smaller sizes. In
particular we find a power-law relation between the sizes at different
redshifts, with the power-law index giving a measure of the relative amount of
dissipation during the mergers that lead to the formation of an elliptical. The
size evolution is found to be stronger for more massive galaxies as they
involve more gas at high redshifts when they form compared to less massive
ellipticals. Local ellipticals more massive than $5 \times 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$
will be approximately 4 times larger than their counterparts at $z=2$. Our
results indicate that the scatter in the size of similar massive present day
elliptical galaxies is a result of their formation epoch, with smaller
ellipticals being formed earlier.",2006-05-17T21:06:33Z
"Formation and structure of the three Neptune-mass planets system around
  HD69830","Since the discovery of the first giant planet outside the solar system in
1995 (Mayor & Queloz 1995), more than 180 extrasolar planets have been
discovered. With improving detection capabilities, a new class of planets with
masses 5-20 times larger than the Earth, at close distance from their parent
star is rapidly emerging. Recently, the first system of three Neptune-mass
planets has been discovered around the solar type star HD69830 (Lovis et al.
2006). Here, we present and discuss a possible formation scenario for this
planetary system based on a consistent coupling between the extended core
accretion model and evolutionary models (Alibert et al. 2005a, Baraffe et al.
2004,2006). We show that the innermost planet formed from an embryo having
started inside the iceline is composed essentially of a rocky core surrounded
by a tiny gaseous envelope. The two outermost planets started their formation
beyond the iceline and, as a consequence, accrete a substantial amount of water
ice during their formation. We calculate the present day thermodynamical
conditions inside these two latter planets and show that they are made of a
rocky core surrounded by a shell of fluid water and a gaseous envelope.",2006-07-10T11:44:19Z
Optical recombination lines as probes of conditions in planetary nebulae,"Since the last IAU symposium on planetary nebulae (PNe), several deep
spectroscopic surveys of the relatively faint optical recombination lines
(ORLs) emitted by heavy element ions in PNe and H II regions have been
completed. New diagnostic tools have been developed thanks to progress in the
calculations of basic atomic data. Together, they have led to a better
understanding of the physical conditions under which the various types of
emission lines arise. The studies have strengthened the previous conjecture
that nebulae contain another component of cold, high metallicity gas, which is
too cool to excite any significant optical or UV CELs and is thus invisible via
such lines. The existence of such a plasma component in PNe and possibly also
in H II regions provides a natural solution to the long-standing problem in
nebular astrophysics, i.e. the dichotomy of nebular plasma diagnostics and
abundance determinations using ORLs and continua on the one hand and
collisionally excited lines (CELs) on the other.",2006-05-03T08:21:28Z
Cosmological Constraints from the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey,"[abridged] We present a first cosmological analysis of a refined cluster
catalog from the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS). The input cluster sample is
derived from 72.07 square degrees of imaging data [...] The catalog contains
956 clusters over 0.35<z<0.95, limited by cluster richness and richness error.
The calibration of the survey images has been extensively cross-checked against
publicly available Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging [...] We analyze the
cluster sample via a general self-calibration technique including scatter in
the mass-richness relation [...]. We fit simultaneously for Omega_M and
sigma_8, and four parameters describing the calibration of cluster richness to
mass, its evolution with redshift, and scatter in the richness-mass relation.
The principal goal of this general analysis is to establish the consistency (or
lack thereof) between the fitted parameters (both cosmological and cluster mass
observables) and available results on both from independent measures. From an
unconstrained analysis, Omega_M and sigma_8 are 0.31+0.11-0.10 and
0.67+0.18-0.13 respectively. An analysis including Gaussian priors on the slope
and zeropoint of the mass-richness relation gives very similar results:
0.30+0.12-0.11 and 0.70+0.27-0.15. Both analyses are in good agreement with the
current literature. The parameters describing the mass-richness relation in the
unconstrained fit are also eminently reasonable and agree with existing
follow-up data on both the RCS-1 and other cluster samples. Our results
directly demonstrate that future surveys (optical and otherwise), with much
larger samples of clusters, can give constraints competitive with other probes
of cosmology.",2006-03-21T20:26:39Z
"GaBoDS: The Garching-Bonn Deep Survey -- IX. A sample of 158
  shear-selected mass concentration candidates","The aim of the present work is the construction of a mass-selected galaxy
cluster sample based on weak gravitational lensing methods. This sample will be
subject to spectroscopic follow-up observations.
  We apply the mass aperture statistics and a derivative of it to 19 square
degrees of high quality, single colour wide field imaging data obtained with
the WFI@MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope. For the statistics a family of filter functions
is used that approximates the expected tangential radial shear profile and thus
allows for the efficient detection of mass concentrations.
  We identify 158 possible mass concentrations. This is the first time that
such a large and blindly selected sample is published. 72 of the detections are
associated with concentrations of bright galaxies. For about 22 of those we
found spectra in the literature, indicating or proving that the galaxies seen
are indeed spatially concentrated. 15 of those were previously known to be
clusters or have meanwhile been secured as such. We currently follow-up a
larger number of them spectroscopically to obtain deeper insight into their
physical properties. The remaining 55% of the possible mass concentrations
found are not associated with any optical light, or could not be classified
unambiguously. We show that those ""dark"" detections are to a significant degree
due to noise, and appear preferentially in shallow data.",2006-07-03T13:42:47Z
Where to find a dark matter sterile neutrino?,"We propose a strategy of how to look for dark matter (DM) particles
possessing a radiative decay channel and derive constraints on their parameters
from observations of X-rays from our own Galaxy and its dwarf satellites. When
applied to the sterile neutrinos in keV mass range, it allows a significant
improvement of restrictions to its parameters, as compared with previous works.",2006-03-24T20:53:50Z
"Adaptive Optics Correction of the Wavefront Distortions Induced by
  Segments Misalignment in Extremely Large Telescope","The capability of the adaptive optics to correct for the segmentation error
is analyzed in terms of the residual wavefront RMS and the power spectral
density of the phase. The analytical model and the end-to-end simulation give
qualitatively equal results justifying the significance of the geometrical
matching between segmentation geometry and the actuators/subaperture
distribution of the adaptive optics. We also show that the design of the
wavefront sensor is rather critical.",2006-06-16T11:59:50Z
"On the luminosity-redshift relation in brane-worlds with cosmological
  constant","In this paper we calculate the luminosity distance - redshift relation for a
special type of flat Friedmann brane with cosmological constant. This special
case is singled out by its simplicity, the luminosity distance being given in
terms of elementary functions. We compare our analytical result with the
expresssion of the luminosity distance for the flat
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe and discuss the
differences.",2006-06-27T18:20:40Z
APEX mapping of H3O+ in the Sgr B2 region,"The cosmic-ray ionization rate (zeta) of dense molecular clouds is a key
parameter for their dynamics and chemistry. Variations of zeta are well
established, but it is unclear if these are related to source column density or
to Galactic location. Using the APEX telescope, we have mapped the 364 GHz line
of H3O+ in the Sgr B2 region and observed the 307 GHz line at selected
positions. With the IRAM 30-m telescope we have observed the 203 GHz line of
H2O-18 at the same positions. Strong H3O+ emission is detected over a ~3x2 pc
region, indicating H3O+ column densities of 10^15 - 10^16 cm^-2 in an 18"" beam.
The H3O+ abundance of ~3 x 10^-9 and H3O+/H2O ratio of ~1/50 in the Sgr B2
envelope are consistent with models with zeta ~4 x 10^-16 s^-1, 3x lower than
derived from H3+ observations toward Sgr A, but 10x that of local dense clouds.
The ionization rates of interstellar clouds thus seem to be to first order
determined by the ambient cosmic-ray flux, while propagation effects cause a
factor of ~3 decrease from diffuse to dense clouds.",2006-05-23T08:29:28Z
Outflows driven by Giant Protoplanets,"We investigate outflows driven by a giant protoplanet using three-dimensional
MHD nested grid simulations. We consider a local region around the protoplanet
in the protoplanetary disk, and calculate three models: (a) unmagnetized disk
model, (b) magnetized disk model having magnetic field azimuthally parallel to
the disk, and (c) magnetic field perpendicular to the disk. Outflows with
velocities, at least, 10 km/s are driven by the protoplanets in both magnetized
disk models, while outflow does not appear in unmagnetized disk model.
Tube-like outflows along the azimuthal direction of the protoplanetary disk
appear in model with magnetic field being parallel to the disk. In this model,
the magnetically dominated regions (i.e., density gap) are clearly contrasted
from other regions and spiral waves appear near the protoplanet. On the other
hand, in model with magnetic field being perpendicular to the disk, outflows
are driven by a protoplanet with cone-like structure just as seen in the
outflow driven by a protostar. Magnetic field lines are strongly twisted near
the protoplanet and the outflows have well-collimated structures in this
model.These outflows can be landmarks for searching exo-protoplanets in their
formation stages. Our results indicate that the accretion rate onto the
protoplanet tend to have a larger value than that expected from previous
hydrodynamical calculations, since a fraction of the angular momentum of
circum-planetary disk is removed by outflows, enhanced non-axisymmetric
patterns caused by magnetic field, and magnetic braking. Possible implications
for observation are also briefly discussed.",2006-04-28T01:28:43Z
"Big Bang Nucleosynthesis with Bound States of Long-lived Charged
  Particles","Charged particles (X) decaying after primordial nucleosynthesis are
constrained by the requirement that their decay products should not change the
light element abundances drastically. If the decaying particle is negatively
charged (X-) then it will bind to the nuclei. We consider the effects of the
decay of X when bound to Helium-4 and show that this will modify the Lithium
abundances.",2006-06-08T20:01:09Z
"Improved Calculation of the Primordial Gravitational Wave Spectrum in
  the Standard Model","We show that the energy density spectrum of the primordial gravitational
waves has characteristic features due to the successive changes in the
relativistic degrees of freedom during the radiation era. These changes make
the evolution of radiation energy density deviate from the conventional
adiabatic evolution, \rho_r~ a^{-4}, and thus cause the expansion rate of the
universe to change suddenly at each transition which, in turn, modifies the
spectrum of primordial gravitational waves. We take into account all the
particles in the Standard Model of elementary particles. In addition,
free-streaming of neutrinos damps the amplitude of gravitational waves, leaving
characteristic features in the energy density spectrum. Our calculations are
solely based on the standard model of cosmology and particle physics, and
therefore these features must exist. Our calculations significantly improve the
previous ones which ignored these effects and predicted a smooth, featureless
spectrum.",2006-04-07T20:00:03Z
"The outermost gravitationally bound orbit around a mass clump in an
  expanding Universe: implication on rotation curves and dark matter halo sizes","Conventional treatment of cold dark matter halos employs the
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile with a maximum radius set at $r=r_{200}$,
where the enclosed matter has an overdensity of 200 times the critical density.
The choice of $r=r_{200}$ is somewhat arbitrary. It is not the collapsed
(virial) radius, but does give $r \sim$ 1 Mpc for rich clusters, which is a
typical X-ray size. Weak lensing measurements, however, reveal halo radii well
in excess of $r_{200}$. Is there a surface that places an absolute limit on the
extension of a halo? To answer the question, we derived analytically the
solution for circular orbits around a mass concentration in an expanding flat
Universe, to show that an outermost orbit exists at $v/r = H$, where $v$ is the
orbital speed and $H$ is the Hubble constant. The solution, parametrized as
$r_2$, is independent of model assumptions on structure formation, and {\it is
the radius at which the furthest particle can be regarded as part of the bound
system}. We present observational evidence in support of dark matter halos
reaching at least as far out as $r=r_2$. An interesting consequence that
emerges concerns the behavior of rotation curves. Near $r=r_2$ velocities will
be biased low. As a result, the mass of many galaxy groups may have been
underestimated. At $r=r_2$ there is an abrupt cutoff in the curve, irrespective
of the halo profile. An important cosmological test can therefore be performed
if velocity disperion data are available out to 10 Mpc radii for nearby
clusters (less at higher redshifts). For Virgo it appears that there is no such
cutoff.",2006-05-24T02:57:51Z
OT 060420: A Seemingly Optical Transient Recorded by All-Sky Cameras,"We report on a ~5th magnitude flash detected for approximately 10 minutes by
two CONCAM all-sky cameras located in Cerro Pachon - Chile and La Palma -
Spain. A third all-sky camera, located in Cerro Paranal - Chile did not detect
the flash, and therefore the authors of this paper suggest that the flash was a
series of cosmic-ray hits, meteors, or satellite glints. Another proposed
hypothesis is that the flash was an astronomical transient with variable
luminosity. In this paper we discuss bright optical transient detection using
fish-eye all-sky monitors, analyze the apparently false-positive optical
transient, and propose possible causes to false optical transient detection in
all-sky cameras.",2006-07-03T22:23:53Z
"Cooling of the quasi-persistent neutron star X-ray transients KS
  1731-260 and MXB 1659-29","We present Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observations that monitor the neutron
star cooling of the quasi-persistent neutron star X-ray transients KS 1731-260
and MXB 1659-29 for approximately 4 years after these sources returned to
quiescence from prolonged outbursts. In both sources the outbursts were long
enough to significantly heat the neutron star crust out of thermal equilibrium
with the core. We analyse the X-ray spectra by fitting absorbed neutron star
atmosphere models to the observations. The results of our analysis strengthen
the preliminary findings of Wijnands et al. that in both sources the neutron
star crust cools down very rapidly suggesting it has a high heat conductivity
and that the neutron star core requires enhanced core cooling processes.
Importantly, we now detect the flattening of the cooling in both sources as the
crust returns to thermal equilibrium with the core. We measure the thermal
equilbrium flux and temperature in both sources by fitting a curve that decays
exponentially to a constant level. The cooling curves cannot be fit with just a
simple exponential decay without the constant offset. We find the constant
bolometric flux and effective temperature components to be (9.2 +/- 0.9)E-14
ergs/cm^2/s and 70.0 +/- 1.6 eV in KS 1731-260 and (1.7 +/- 0.3)E-14
ergs/cm^2/s and 51.6 +/- 1.4 eV in MXB 1659-29. In addition, we find that the
crust of KS 1731-260 cools faster than that of MXB 1659-29 by a factor of ~2,
likely due to different crustal properties. This is the first time that the
cooling of a neutron star crust into thermal equilibrium with the core has been
observed in such detail.",2006-05-19T11:19:46Z
Antisymmetric Metric Field as Dark Matter,"We consider the generation and evolution of quantum fluctuations of a massive
nonsymmetric gravitational field (B-field) from inflationary epoch to matter
era in the simplest variant of the nonsymmetric theory of gravitation (NGT),
which consists of a gauge kinetic term and a mass term.
  We observe that quite generically a nonsymmetric metric field with mass, m_B
~ 0.03(H_I/10^(13) GeV)^4 eV, is a good dark matter candidate, where H_I
denotes the inflationary scale. The most prominent feature of this dark matter
is a peak in power at a comoving momentum, k ~ sqrt(m_B H_0)/(1+z_eq)^(1/4),
where z_eq is the redshift at equality. This scale corresponds roughly to the
Earth-Sun distance.",2006-06-13T14:49:11Z
Binary Stellar Population Synthesis Study of Elliptical Galaxies,"We determine relative stellar ages and metallicities mainly for about 80
elliptical galaxies in low and high density environments via the latest binary
stellar population (BSP) synthesis model and test a latest hierarchical
formation model of elliptical galaxies which adopted the new $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology for the first time. The stellar ages and metallicities of galaxies
are estimated from two high-quality published spectra line indices, i.e.
H$\beta$ and [MgFe]. The results show that elliptical galaxies have stellar
populations older than 3.9 Gyr and more metal rich than 0.02. Most of our
results are in agreement with predictions of the model: First, elliptical
galaxies in denser environment are redder and have older populations than field
galaxies. Second, elliptical galaxies with more massive stellar components are
redder while have older and more metal rich populations than less massive ones.
Third, the most massive galaxies are shown to have the oldest and most metal
rich stars. However, some of our results are found to be different with
predictions of the galaxy formation model, i.e. the metallicity distributions
of low- and high-density elliptical galaxies and the relations relating to
cluster-centric distance.",2006-05-24T02:45:46Z
"Ultraviolet Through Far-Infrared Spatially Resolved Analysis of the
  Recent Star Formation in M81 (NGC3031)","The recent star formation (SF) in the early-type spiral galaxy M81 is
characterized using imaging observations from the far-ultraviolet (UV) to the
far-infrared (IR). We compare these data with models of the stellar, gas, and
dust emission for sub-galactic regions. Our results suggest the existence of a
diffuse dust emission not directly linked to the recent SF. We find a radial
decrease of the dust temperature and dust mass density, and in the attenuation
of the stellar light. The IR emission in M81 can be modeled with three
components: 1) cold dust with a temperature <T_c>=18+-2 K, concentrated near
the HII regions but also presenting a diffuse distribution; 2) warm dust with
T_w=53+-7 K, directly linked with the HII regions; and 3) aromatic molecules,
with diffuse morphology peaking around the HII regions. We derive several
relationships to obtain total IR luminosities from IR monochromatic fluxes, and
we compare five different star formation rate (SFR) estimators for HII regions
in M81 and M51: the UV, Halpha, and three estimators based on Spitzer data. We
find that the Halpha luminosity absorbed by dust correlates tightly with the 24
microns emission. The correlation with the total IR luminosity is not as good.
Important variations from galaxy to galaxy are found when estimating the total
SFR with the 24 microns or the total IR emission alone. The most reliable
estimations of the total SFRs are obtained by combining the Halpha emission (or
the UV) and an IR luminosity (especially the 24 microns emission), which probe
the unobscured and obscured SF, respectively. For the entire M81 galaxy, about
50% of the total SF is obscured by dust. The percentage of obscured SF ranges
from 60% in the inner regions of the galaxy to 30% in the outer zones.",2006-05-23T21:29:54Z
Population analysis of open clusters: radii and mass segregation,"Aims: Based on our well-determined sample of open clusters in the all-sky
catalogue ASCC-2.5 we derive new linear sizes of some 600 clusters, and
investigate the effect of mass segregation of stars in open clusters. Methods:
Using statistical methods, we study the distribution of linear sizes as a
function of spatial position and cluster age. We also examine statistically the
distribution of stars of different masses within clusters as a function of the
cluster age. Results: No significant dependence of the cluster size on location
in the Galaxy is detected for younger clusters (< 200 Myr), whereas older
clusters inside the solar orbit turned out to be, on average, smaller than
outside. Also, small old clusters are preferentially found close to the
Galactic plane, whereas larger ones more frequently live farther away from the
plane and at larger Galactocentric distances. For clusters with (V - M_V) <
10.5, a clear dependence of the apparent radius on age has been detected: the
cluster radii decrease by a factor of about 2 from an age of 10 Myr to an age
of 1 Gyr. A detailed analysis shows that this observed effect can be explained
by mass segregation and does not necessarily reflect a real decrease of cluster
radii. We found evidence for the latter for the majority of clusters older than
30 Myr. Among the youngest clusters (between 5 and 30 Myr), there are some
clusters with a significant grade of mass segregation, whereas some others show
no segregation at all. At a cluster age between 50 and 100 Myrs, the
distribution of stars of different masses becomes more regular over cluster
area. In older clusters the evolution of the massive stars is the most
prominent effect we observe.",2006-06-09T10:30:55Z
"A new method for the spectroscopic identification of stellar non-radial
  pulsation modes. II. Mode identification of the Delta Scuti star FG Virginis","We present a mode identification based on new high-resolution time-series
spectra of the non-radially pulsating Delta Scuti star FG~Vir (HD 106384, V =
6.57, A5V). From 2002 February to June a global Delta Scuti Network (DSN)
campaign, utilizing high-resolution spectroscopy and simultaneous photometry
has been conducted for FG~Vir in order to provide a theoretical pulsation
model. In this campaign we have acquired 969 Echelle spectra covering 147 hours
at six observatories. The mode identification was carried out by analyzing line
profile variations by means of the Fourier parameter fit method, where the
observational Fourier parameters across the line are fitted with theoretical
values. This method is especially well suited for determining the azimuthal
order m of non-radial pulsation modes and thus complementary with the method of
Daszynska-Daszkiewicz (2002) which does best at identifying the degree l. 15
frequencies between 9.2 and 33.5 c/d were detected spectroscopically. We
determined the azimuthal order m of 12 modes and constrained their harmonic
degree l. Only modes of low degree (l <= 4) were detected, most of them having
axisymmetric character mainly due to the relatively low projected rotational
velocity of FG Vir. The detected non-axisymmetric modes have azimuthal orders
between -2 and 1. We derived an inclination of 19 degrees, which implies an
equatorial rotational rate of 66 km/s.",2006-06-21T11:11:58Z
"Chaotic zone boundary for low free eccentricity particles near an
  eccentric planet","We consider particles with low free or proper eccentricity that are orbiting
near planets on eccentric orbits. Via collisionless particle integration we
numerically find the location of the boundary of the chaotic zone in the
planet's corotation region. We find that the distance in semi-major axis
between the planet and boundary depends on the planet mass to the 2/7 power and
is independent of the planet eccentricity, at least for planet eccentricities
below 0.3. Our integrations reveal a similarity between the dynamics of
particles at zero eccentricity near a planet in a circular orbit and with zero
free eccentricity particles near an eccentric planet. The 2/7 law has been
previously explained by estimating the semi-major at which the first order mean
motion resonances are large enough to overlap. Orbital dynamics near an
eccentric planet could differ due to first order corotation resonances that
have strength proportional to the planet's eccentricity. However, we find the
corotation resonance width at low free eccentricity is small. Also the first
order resonance width at zero free eccentricity is the same as that for a zero
eccentricity particle near a planet in a circular orbit. This accounts for
insensitivity of the chaotic zone width to planet eccentricity. Particles at
zero free eccentricity near an eccentric planet have similar dynamics to those
at zero eccentricity near a planet in a circular orbit.",2006-08-02T13:33:25Z
"Constraints on the Accretion History of Massive Black Holes from Faint
  X-ray Counts","We investigate how hierarchical models for the co-evolution of the massive
black hole (MBH) and AGN population can reproduce the observed faint X-ray
counts. We find that the main variable influencing the theoretical predictions
is the Eddington ratio of accreting sources. We compare three different models
proposed for the evolution of AGN Eddington ratio, f_Edd: constant f_Edd=1,
f_Edd decreasing with redshift, and f_Edd depending on the AGN luminosity, as
suggested by simulations of galactic mergers including BHs and AGN feedback. We
follow the full assembly of MBHs and host halos from early times to the present
in a LambdaCDM cosmology. AGN activity is triggered by halo major mergers and
MBHs accrete mass until they satisfy the observed correlation with velocity
dispersion. We find that all three models can reproduce fairly well the total
faint X-ray counts. The redshift distribution is however poorly matched in the
first two models. The Eddington ratios suggested by merger simulations predicts
no turn-off of the faint end of the AGN optical luminosity function at
redshifts z>=1 down to very low luminosity.",2006-06-28T01:48:32Z
The distribution of SiO in the circumstellar envelope around IRC+10216,"New interferometric observations of SiO J=5-4 circumstellar line emission
around the carbon star IRC+10216, using the Submillimeter Array, are presented.
Complemented by multi-transition single-dish observations, including infrared
observations of ro-vibrational transitions, detailed radiative transfer
modelling suggests that the fractional abundance of SiO in the inner part of
the envelope, between approximately 3-8 stellar radii, is as high as 1.5E-6.
This is more than an order of magnitude higher than predicted by equilibrium
stellar atmosphere chemistry in a carbon-rich environment and indicative of the
importance of non-LTE chemical processes. In addition to the compact component,
a spatially more extended (2.4E16 cm) low-fractional-abundance (1.7E-7) region
is required to fit the observations. This suggests that the majority of the SiO
molecules are effectively accreted onto dust grains in the inner wind while the
remaining gas-phase molecules are eventually photodissociated at larger
distances. Evidence of departure from a smooth wind is found in the observed
visibilities, indicative of density variations of a factor 2 to 5 on an angular
scale corresponding to a time scale of about 200 years. Additionally,
constraints on the velocity structure of the wind are obtained.",2006-05-19T07:32:41Z
Analysis of 26 Barium Stars I. Abundances,"We present a detailed analysis of 26 barium stars, including dwarf barium
stars, providing their atmospheric parameters (Teff, log g, [Fe/H], vt) and
elemental abundances. We aim at deriving gravities and luminosity classes of
the sample stars, in particular to confirm the existence of dwarf barium stars.
Accurate abundances of chemical elements were derived. Abundance ratios between
nucleosynthetic processes, by using Eu and Ba as representatives of the r- and
s-processes are presented. High-resolution spectra with the FEROS spectrograph
at the ESO-1.5m Telescope, and photometric data with Fotrap at the Zeiss
telescope at the LNA were obtained. The atmospheric parameters were derived in
an iterative way, with temperatures obtained from colour-temperature
calibrations. The abundances were derived using spectrum synthesis for Li, Na,
Al, alpha-, iron peak, s- and r-elements atomic lines, and C and N molecular
lines. Atmospheric parameters in the range 4300 < Teff < 6500, -1.2 < [Fe/H] <
0.0 and 1.4 < log g < 4.6 were derived, confirming that our sample contains
giants, subgiants and dwarfs. The abundance results obtained for Li, Al, Na,
alpha- and iron peak elements for the sample stars show that they are
compatible with the values found in the literature for normal disk stars in the
same range of metallicities. Enhancements of C, N and heavy elements relative
to Fe, that characterise barium stars, were derived and showed that [X/Ba] vs.
[Ba/H] and [X/Ba] vs. [Fe/H] present different behaviour as compared to [X/Eu]
vs. [Eu/H] and [X/Eu] vs. [Fe/H], reflecting the different nucleosynthetic
sites for the s- and r-processes.",2006-04-03T19:28:32Z
"A Chemical Abundance Study of three RHB and two RGB stars in NGC6637
  (M69)","We present a detailed chemical abundance study of three red horizontal branch
and two red giant branch stars in the metal-rich globular cluster NGC 6637
(M69). The value of [Fe/H] derived from LTE calculations is $-$0.77 $\pm$ 0.02
dex. We also discuss the anticorrelation between oxygen and sodium abundances
in the program stars and compare the [Si/Ti] ratio of NGC 6637 with those of
other globular clusters.",2006-04-12T12:45:56Z
"Poynting Flux out of Rotating Black Hole and Accretion Flow through
  Force-Free Magnetosphere","The basic features of the Poynting flux from the horizon and the ergosphere
of a black hole and from the accreting flow onto a black hole are discussed for
the force-free magnetosphere. The accretion flow dominated by the Poynting flux
is discussed and the possible Poynting flux from the equatorial plane inside
the ergosphere is discussed.",2006-05-24T14:14:10Z
A catalogue of ULX coincidences with FIRST radio sources,"We search for ultra luminous X-ray source (ULXs) radio counterparts located
in nearby galaxies in order to constrain their physical nature. Our work is
based on a systematic cross-identification of the most recent and extensive
available ULX catalogues and archival radio data. A catalogue of 70 positional
coincidences is reported. Most of them are located within the galaxy nucleus.
Among them, we find 11 new cases of non-nuclear ULX sources with possibly
associated radio emission.",2006-05-22T11:14:51Z
"Spitzer observations of acetylene bands in carbon-rich AGB stars in the
  Large Magellanic Cloud","We investigate the molecular bands in carbon-rich AGB stars in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC), using the InfraRed Spectrograph (IRS) on board the
Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) over the 5--38 micron range. All 26
low-resolution spectra show acetylene (C2H2) bands at 7 and 14 micron. The
hydrogen cyanide (HCN) bands at these wavelengths are very weak or absent. This
is consistent with low nitrogen abundances in the LMC. The observed 14 micron
C2H2 band is reasonably reproduced by an excitation temperature of 500 K. There
is no clear dilution of the 14 micron band by circumstellar dust emission. This
14 micron band originates from molecular gas in the circumstellar envelope in
these high mass-loss rate stars, in agreement with previous findings for
Galactic stars. The C2H2,column density, derived from the 13.7 micron band,
shows a gas mass-loss rate in the range 3x10^-6 to 5x10^{-5} Msun yr-1. This is
comparable with the total mass-loss rate of these stars estimated from the
spectral energy distribution. Additionally, we compare the line strengths of
the 13.7 micron C2H2 band of our LMC sample with those of a Galactic sample.
Despite the low metallicity of the LMC, there is no clear difference in the
C2H2 abundance among LMC and Galactic stars. This reflects the effect of the
3rd dredge-up bringing self-produced carbon to the surface, leading to high C/O
ratios at low metallicity.",2006-06-13T07:23:42Z
An I-band calibration of the SBF method at blue colours,"The surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) method is a powerful tool to derive
distances to galaxies for which single stars cannot be resolved. Up to now, the
method has been calibrated mainly at red colours due to the intrinsic faintness
of blue early-type galaxies. In this paper we address the I-band calibration of
the SBF method at blue colours, the regime of dwarf elliptical galaxies (dEs).
We present deep and wide-field VI photometry of the central Fornax cluster
obtained at Las Campanas Observatory. With these data we perform an SBF
analysis of 25 dEs in the range -16.5<M_V<-11.2 mag, 0.8<(V-I)_0<1.10 mag. For
the calibration analysis we exclude eight dEs whose SBF measurement was
affected by poor seeing (FWHM ~ 1""). Our SBF data are inconsistent at the 3
sigma level with a colour independent absolute SBF magnitude Mbar_I, presenting
a problem for SBF models that predict such a flat relation. There is a weak
indication in our data (1.8 sigma) to favour a two-branch calibration over a
one-branch calibration with broad scatter in the Mbar_I - (V-I) plane. We
obtain the following one-branch empirical SBF calibration:
  Mbar_I=-2.13 (+/- 0.17) + 2.44 (+/- 1.94) * [(V-I)_0 - 1.00] mag.
  We deduce a 0.34 +/- 0.14 mag cosmic scatter of Mbar_I, which is
significantly larger than found at redder colours. This is in agreement with
those theoretical SBF models that predict Mbar_I to be more sensitive to
age-metallicity variations in the blue than in the red. We find evidence that
the fainter galaxies in our samples contain younger and more metal-rich stellar
populations than the brighter ones. The application of our empirical
calibration to published SBF measurements of Hydra and Centaurus cluster dEs
leaves the distances to both clusters unchanged.",2006-05-26T11:28:28Z
Aromatic Features in M101 HII Regions and Starburst Galaxies,"The behavior of the aromatic features as a function of metallicity/radiation
field hardness in M101 HII regions and starburst galaxies is investigated using
Spitzer/IRS spectra. These spectra reveal that the 6.2, 7.8+8.6, and 11.3
micron aromatics have different dependencies on metallicity/radiation field
hardness. Specifically, the 6.2 and 7.8+8.6 micron aromatics are weak or absent
at a metallicity, 12+log(O/H), of approx. 8.0 while the 11.3 micron feature
remains relatively strong. These results apply to both the M101 HII regions and
starbursts showing that HII regions can indeed be thought of as
``mini-starbursts.'' Comparison of this work with various candidate materials
results in a good match with the annealing behavior in Quenched Carbonaceous
Composite (QCC) which is an amorphous, hydrogenated, carbonaceous solid.",2006-05-22T02:09:39Z
"Prospects for Lunar Satellite Detection of Radio Pulses from Ultrahigh
  Energy Neutrinos Interacting with the Moon","The Moon provides a huge effective detector volume for ultrahigh energy
cosmic neutrinos, which generate coherent radio pulses in the lunar surface
layer due to the Askaryan effect. In light of presently considered lunar
missions, we propose radio measurements from a Moon-orbiting satellite. First
systematic Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the detectability of Askaryan
pulses from neutrinos with energies above 10^{20} eV, i.e. near and above the
interesting GZK limit, at the very low fluxes predicted in different scenarios.",2006-04-10T17:20:57Z
"Self-Similar Evolutionary Solutions of Self-Gravitating, Polytropic
  $β$-Viscous Disks","We carry out the effect of $\beta$-prescription for viscosity which
introduced by Duschel et al. 2000 & Hure, Richard & Zhan 2001, in a standard
self-gravitating thin disks. We were predicted in a self-gravitating thin disk
the $\beta$-model will have different dynamical behavior compare the well known
$\alpha$-prescriptions. We used self-similar methods for solving the integrated
equations which govern the dynamical behavior of the thin disks. We present the
results of self-similar solutions of the time evolution of axisymmetric,
polytropic, self-gravitating viscous disks around a new born central object. We
apply a $\beta$-viscosity prescription which has been derived from rotating
shear flow experiments ($\nu=\beta r^2\Omega$). Using reduced equations in a
slow accretion limit, we demonstrate inside-out self-similar solutions after
core formation in the center. Some physical quantities for $\beta$-disks are
determined numerically.We have compared our results with $\alpha$-disks under
the same initial conditions. It has been found that the accretion rate onto the
central object for $\beta$-disks more than $\alpha$-disks at least in the outer
regions where $\beta$-disks are more efficient. Our results show that Toomre
instability parameter is less than one everywhere on the $\beta$-disk which
means that in such disks gravitational instabilities can be occurred, so the
$\beta$-disk model can be a good candidate for the origin of planetary systems.
Our results show that the $\beta$-disks will decouple in the outer part of the
disk where the self-gravity plays an important role which is in agreement with
Duschl predictions.",2006-07-14T21:47:58Z
Wind-Blown Bubbles around Evolved Stars,"Most stars will experience episodes of substantial mass loss at some point in
their lives. For very massive stars, mass loss dominates their evolution,
although the mass loss rates are not known exactly, particularly once the star
has left the main sequence. Direct observations of the stellar winds of massive
stars can give information on the current mass-loss rates, while studies of the
ring nebulae and HI shells that surround many Wolf-Rayet (WR) and luminous blue
variable (LBV) stars provide information on the previous mass-loss history. The
evolution of the most massive stars, (M > 25 solar masses), essentially follows
the sequence O star to LBV or red supergiant (RSG) to WR star to supernova. For
stars of mass less than 25 solar masses there is no final WR stage. During the
main sequence and WR stages, the mass loss takes the form of highly supersonic
stellar winds, which blow bubbles in the interstellar and circumstellar medium.
In this way, the mechanical luminosity of the stellar wind is converted into
kinetic energy of the swept-up ambient material, which is important for the
dynamics of the interstellar medium. In this review article, analytic and
numerical models are used to describe the hydrodynamics and energetics of
wind-blown bubbles. A brief review of observations of bubbles is given, and the
degree to which theory is supported by observations is discussed.",2006-05-21T04:10:06Z
Magnetic Jets from Swirling Disks,"A broad swathe of astrophysical phenomena, ranging from tubular planetary
nebulae through Herbig-Haro objects, radio-galaxy and quasar emissions to
gamma-ray bursts and perhaps high-energy cosmic rays, may be driven by
magnetically-dominated jets emanating from accretion disks. We give a
self-contained account of the analytic theory of non-relativistic magnetically
dominated jets wound up by a swirling disk and making a magnetic cavity in a
background medium of any prescribed pressure, p(z). We solve the time-dependent
problem for any specified distribution of magnetic flux P(R,0) emerging from
the disk at z=0, with any specified disk angular velocity Omega_d(R). The
physics required to do this involves only the freezing of the lines of force to
the conducting medium and the principle of minimum energy.",2006-04-20T08:58:21Z
"Distinguishing Propagation vs. Launch Physics of Astrophysical Jets and
  the Role of Experiments","The absence of other viable momentum sources for collimated flows leads to
the likelihood that magnetic fields play a fundamental role in jet launch
and/or collimation in astrophysical jets. To best understand the physics of
jets, it is useful to distinguish between the launch region where the jet is
accelerated and the larger scales where the jet propagates as a collimated
structure. Observations presently resolve jet propagation, but not the launch
region. Simulations typically probe the launch and propagation regions
separately, but not both together. Here, I identify some of the physics of jet
launch vs. propagation and what laboratory jet experiments to date have probed.
Reproducing an astrophysical jet in the lab is unrealistic, so maximizing the
benefit of the experiments requires clarifying the astrophysical connection.",2006-06-28T06:41:43Z
Low Mach number modeling of Type I X-ray burst deflagrations,"The Low Mach Number Approximation (LMNA) is applied to 2D hydrodynamical
modeling of Type I X-ray bursts on a rectangular patch on the surface of a
non-rotating neutron star. Because such phenomena involve decidedly subsonic
flows, the timestep increase offered by the LMNA makes routine simulations of
these deflagrations feasible in an environment where strong gravity produces
significant stratification, while allowing for potentially significant lateral
differences in temperature and density. The model is employed to simulate the
heating, peak, and initial cooling stages in the deep envelope layers of a
burst. During the deflagration, Benard-like cells naturally fill up a
vertically expanding convective layer. The Mach number is always less than 0.15
throughout the simulation, thus justifying the low Mach number approximation.
While the convective layer is superadiabatic on average, significant
fluctuations in adiabaticity occur within it on subconvective timescales. Due
to convective layer expansion, significant compositional mixing naturally
occurs, but tracer particle penetration through the convective layer boundaries
on convective timescales is temporary and spatially limited. Thus, mixing
occurs on the relatively slow burst timescale through thermal expansion of the
convective layer rather than from mass penetration of the convective layer
boundary through particle convection. At the convective layer boundaries where
mixing is less efficient, the actual temperature gradient more closely follows
the Ledoux criteria.",2006-06-08T19:26:38Z
Simulations of globular clusters merging in galactic nuclear regions,"We present the results of detailed N-body simulations regarding the
interaction of four massive globular clusters in the central region of a
triaxial galaxy. The systems undergo a full merging event, producing a sort of
'Super Star Cluster' (SSC) whose features are close to those of a superposition
of the individual initial mergers. In contrast with other similar simulations,
the resulting SSC structural parameters are located along the observed scaling
relations of globular clusters. These findings seem to support the idea that a
massive SSC may have formed in early phases of the mother galaxy evolution and
contributed to the growth of a massive nucleus.",2006-04-29T10:25:37Z
Orbital Parameters for the X-ray Pulsar IGR J16393-4643,"With recent and archival Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) X-ray
measurements of the heavily obscured X-ray pulsar IGR J16393-4643, we carried
out a pulse timing analysis to determine the orbital parameters. Assuming a
circular orbit, we phase-connected data spanning over 1.5 years. The most
likely orbital solution has a projected semi-major axis of 43 +- 2 lt-s and an
orbital period of 3.6875 +- 0.0006 days. This implies a mass function of 6.5 +-
1.1 M_sun and confirms that this INTEGRAL source is a High Mass X-ray Binary
(HMXB) system. By including eccentricity in the orbital model, we find e < 0.25
at the 2 sigma level. The 3.7 day orbital period and the previously known ~910
s pulse period place the system in the region of the Corbet diagram populated
by supergiant wind accretors, and the low eccentricity is also consistent with
this type of system. Finally, it should be noted that although the 3.7 day
solution is the most likely one, we cannot completely rule out two other
solutions with orbital periods of 50.2 and 8.1 days.",2006-05-25T22:53:10Z
Mid- and high-J CO observations towards UCHIIs,"A study of 12 ultracompact HII regions was conducted to probe the physical
conditions and kinematics in the inner envelopes of the molecular clumps
harboring them. The APEX telescope was used to observe the sources in the CO
(4-3) and 13CO (8-7) lines. Line intensities were modeled with the RATRAN
radiative transfer code using power laws for the density and temperature to
describe the physical structure of the clumps. All sources were detected in
both lines. The optically thick CO (4-3) line shows predominantly blue skewed
profiles reminiscent of infall. Line intensities can be reproduced well using
the physical structure of the clumps taken from the literature. The optically
thick line profiles show that CO is a sensitive tracer of ongoing infall in the
outer envelopes of clumps harboring ultracompact HII regions and hot molecular
cores.",2006-05-26T14:52:40Z
Reaction Rate Uncertainties: NeNa and MgAl in AGB Stars,"We study the effect of uncertainties in the proton-capture reaction rates of
the NeNa and MgAl chains on nucleosynthesis due to the operation of hot bottom
burning (HBB) in intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. HBB
nucleosynthesis is associated with the production of sodium, radioactive Al26
and the heavy magnesium isotopes, and it is possibly responsible for the O, Na,
Mg and Al abundance anomalies observed in globular cluster stars.
  We model HBB with an analytic code based on full stellar evolution models so
we can quickly cover a large parameter space. The reaction rates are varied
first individually, then all together. This creates a knock-on effect, where an
increase of one reaction rate affects production of an isotope further down the
reaction chain. We find the yields of Ne22, Na23 and Al26 to be the most
susceptible to current nuclear reaction rate uncertainties.",2006-07-24T12:17:45Z
"A New Mechanism for Gravitational Wave Emission in Core-Collapse
  Supernovae","We present a new theory for the gravitational wave signatures of
core-collapse supernovae. Previous studies identified axisymmetric rotating
core collapse, core bounce, postbounce convection, and anisotropic neutrino
emission as the primary processes and phases for the radiation of gravitational
waves. Our results, which are based on axisymmetric, Newtonian
radiation-hydrodynamics supernova simulations (Burrows et al. 2006), indicate
that the dominant emission process of gravitational waves in core-collapse
supernovae may be the oscillations of the protoneutron star core. The
oscillations are predominantly of g-mode character, are excited hundreds of
milliseconds after bounce, and typically last for several hundred milliseconds.
Our results suggest that even nonrotating core-collapse supernovae should be
visible to current LIGO-class detectors throughout the Galaxy, and depending on
progenitor structure, possibly out to Megaparsec distances.",2006-05-19T11:49:05Z
Future state of the Universe,"Following the observational evidence for cosmic acceleration which may
exclude a possibility for the universe to recollapse to a second singularity,
we review alternative scenarios of its future evolution. Although the de Sitter
asymptotic state is still an option, some other asymptotic states which allow
new types of singularities such as Big-Rip (due to a phantom matter) and sudden
future singularities are also admissible and are reviewed in detail. The
reality of these singularities which comes from the relation to observational
characteristics of the universe expansion are also revealed and widely
discussed.",2006-06-22T21:37:09Z
High resolution X-ray spectroscopy of bright O type stars,"Archival X-ray spectra of the four prominent single, non-magnetic O stars
Zeta Pup, Zeta Ori, Ksi Per and Zeta Oph, obtained in high resolution with
Chandra HETGS/MEG have been studied. The resolved X-ray emission line profiles
provide information about the shocked, hot gas which emits the X-radiation, and
about the bulk of comparably cool stellar wind material which partly absorbs
this radiation. In this paper, we synthesize X-ray line profiles with a model
of a clumpy stellar wind. We find that the geometrical shape of the wind
inhomogeneities is important: better agreement with the observations can be
achieved with radially compressed clumps than with spherical clumps. The
parameters of the model, i.e. chemical abundances, stellar radius, mass-loss
rate and terminal wind velocity, are taken from existing analyses of UV and
optical spectra of the programme stars. On this basis, we also calculate the
continuum-absorption coefficient of the cool-wind material, using the Potsdam
Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmosphere code. The radial location of X-ray emitting
gas is restricted from analysing the fir line ratios of helium-like ions. The
only remaining free parameter of our model is the typical distance between the
clumps; here, we assume that at any point in the wind there is one clump
passing by per one dynamical time-scale of the wind. The total emission in a
model line is scaled to the observation. There is a good agreement between
synthetic and observed line profiles. We conclude that the X-ray emission line
profiles in O stars can be explained by hot plasma embedded in a cool wind
which is highly clumped in the form of radially compressed shell fragments.",2006-03-11T21:25:45Z
"uvbyCa H beta CCD Photometry of Clusters. VII. The Intermediate-Age
  Anticenter Cluster Melotte 71","CCD photometry on the intermediate-band uvbyCa H beta system is presented for
the anticenter, intermediate-age open cluster, Melotte 71. Restricting the data
to probable single members of the cluster using the color-magnitude diagram and
the photometric indices alone generates a sample of 48 F dwarfs on the
unevolved main sequence. The average E(b-y) = 0.148 +/- 0.003 (s.e.m.) or
E(B-V) = 0.202 +/- 0.004 (s.e.m.), where the errors refer to internal errors
alone. With this reddening, [Fe/H] is derived from both m1 and hk, using H beta
and b-y as the temperature index, with excellent agreement among the four
approaches and a final weighted average of [Fe/H] = -0.17 +/- 0.02 (s.e.m.) for
the cluster, on a scale where the Hyades has [Fe/H] = +0.12. When adjusted for
the higher reddening estimate, the previous metallicity estimates from
Washington photometry and from spectroscopy are now in agreement with the
intermediate-band result. From comparisons to isochrones of appropriate
metallicity, the cluster age and distance are determined as 0.9 +/- 0.1 Gyr and
(m-M) = 12.2 +/- 0.1 or (m-M)_0 = 11.6 +/- 0.1. At this distance from the sun,
Mel 71 has a galactocentric distance of 10.0 kpc on a scale where the sun is
8.5 kpc from the galactic center. Based upon its age, distance, and elemental
abundances, Mel 71 appears to be a less populous analog to NGC 3960.",2006-04-05T19:57:05Z
Modelling of the spectra and atmospheres of evolved stars,"The method and results of the computation of the model atmospheres and
spectral energy distributions of chemically peculiar stars, are discussed. The

"Scientific Results from High-precision Astrometry at the Palomar Testbed

in2002-2003 which enables differential astrometry at the level of 20
micro-arcseconds for binary systems with separations of several hundred
milli-arcseconds (mas). This phase-referenced mode is the basis of the Palomar
High-precision Astrometric Search for Exoplanet Systems (PHASES), a search for
giant planets orbiting either the primary or secondary star in fifty binary
systems. We present the first science results from the PHASES search. The
properties of the stars comprising binary systems are determined to high
precision. The mutual inclinations of several hierarchical triple star systems
have been determined. We will present upper limits constraining the the
existence of giant planets in a few of the target systems.",2006-05-31T01:37:53Z
"The Discovery of a Neutron Star with a Spin Frequency of 530 Hz in
  A1744-361","We report the detection with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE)
Proportional Counter Array (PCA) of 530 Hz burst oscillations in a
thermonuclear (type I) burst from the transient X-ray source A1744-361. This is
only the second burst ever observed from this source, and the first to be seen
in any detail. Our results confirm that A1744-361 is a low mass X-ray binary
(LMXB) system harboring a rapidly rotating neutron star. The oscillations are
first detected along the rising edge of the burst, and they show evidence for
frequency evolution of a magnitude similar to that seen in other burst sources.
The modulation amplitude and its increase with photon energy are also typical
of burst oscillations. The lack of any strong indication of photospheric radius
expansion during the burst suggests a 9 kpc upper limit of the source distance.
We also find energy dependent dips, establishing A1744-361 as a high
inclination, dipping LMXB. The timescale between the two episodes of observed
dips suggests an orbital period of ~ 97 minutes. We have also detected a 2 - 4
Hz quasi-periodic-oscillation (QPO) for the first time from this source. This
QPO appears consistent with ~ 1 Hz QPOs seen from other high-inclination
systems. We searched for kilohertz QPOs, and found a suggestive 2.3 sigma
feature at 800 Hz in one observation. The frequency, strength, and quality
factor are consistent with that of a lower frequency kilohertz QPO, but the
relatively low significance argues for caution, so we consider this a tentative
detection requiring confirmation.",2006-07-19T17:00:22Z
"Dynamical age of the universe as a constraint on the parametrization of
  dark energy equation of state","The dynamical age of the universe depends upon the rate of the expansion of
the universe, which explicitly involves the dark energy equation of state
parameter $w(z)$. Consequently, the evolution of $w(z)$ has a direct imprint on
the age of the universe. We have shown that the dynamical age of the universe
as derived from CMB data can be used as an authentic criterion, being
independent of the priors like the present value of the Hubble constant $H_{0}$
and the cosmological density parameter $\Omega_{M}^{0}$, to constrain the range
of admissible values of $w$ for quiessence models and to test the physically
viable parametrizations of the equation of state $w(z) $ in kinessence models.
An upper bound on variation of dark energy density is derived and a relation
between cosmological density parameters and the transition redshift is
established.",2006-03-29T10:05:55Z
"The Araucaria Project. An Accurate Distance to the Local Group Galaxy
  NGC 6822 from Near-Infrared Photometry of Cepheid Variables","We have measured near-infrared magnitudes in the J and K bands for 56 Cepheid
variables in the Local Group galaxy NGC 6822 with well-determined periods and
optical light curves in the V and I bands. Using the template light curve
approach of Soszynski, Gieren and Pietrzynski, accurate mean magnitudes were
obtained from these data which allowed us to determine with unprecedented
accuracy the distance to NGC 6822 from a multi-wavelength period-luminosity
solution in the VIJK bands. From our data, we obtain a distance to NGC 6822 of
(m-M)_{0} = 23.312 +- 0.021 (random error) mag, with an additional systematic
uncertainty of about 3 %. This distance value is tied to an assumed LMC
distance modulus of 18.50. From our multiwavelength approach, we find for the
total (average) reddening to the NGC 6822 Cepheids E(B-V) = 0.356 +- 0.013 mag,
which is in excellent agreement with a previous determination of McGonegal et
al. from near-infrared photometry and implies significant internal reddening of
the Cepheids in NGC 6822. Our present, definitive distance determination of NGC
6822 from Cepheids agrees within 2 % with the previous distance we had derived
from optical photometry alone, but has significantly reduced error bars.
  Our Cepheid distance to NGC 6822 is in excellent agreement with the recent
independent determination of Cioni and Habing from the I-band magnitude of the
tip of the red giant branch. It also agrees well, within the errors, with the
early determination of McGonegal et al. (1983) from random-phase H-band
photometry of nine Cepheids.",2006-05-09T12:41:05Z
"Density profiles of galaxy groups and clusters from SDSS galaxy-galaxy
  weak lensing","We present results of a measurement of the shape of the density profile of
galaxy groups and clusters traced by 43 335 Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) with
spectroscopic redshifts from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The galaxies
are selected such that they are the brightest within a cylindrical aperture,
split into two luminosity samples, and modeled as the sum of stellar and dark
matter components. We present a detailed investigation of many possible
systematic effects that could contaminate our signal and develop methods to
remove them, including a detected intrinsic alignment for galaxies within 100
kpc/h of LRGs which we remove using photometric redshift information. The
resulting lensing signal is consistent with NFW profile dark matter halos; the
SIS profile is ruled out at the 96 (conservatively) and 99.96 per cent
confidence level (CL) for the fainter and brighter lens samples (respectively)
when we fit using lensing data between 40 kpc/h and 2 Mpc/h with total
signal-to-noise of 19 and 25 for the two lens samples. The lensing signal
amplitude suggests that the faint and bright sample galaxies typically reside
in haloes of mass (2.9+/-0.4)x10^{13} M_{sun}/h and (6.7+/-0.8)x10^{13}
M_{sun}/h respectively, in good agreement with predictions based on halo
spatial density with normalization lower than the 'concordance' sigma_8=0.9.
When fitting for the concentration parameter in the NFW profile, we find c =
5.0+/-0.6 (stat) +/-1 (sys), and c = 5.6+/-0.6 (stat) +/-1 (sys) for the faint
and bright samples, consistent with Lambda-CDM simulations. We also split the
bright sample further to determine masses and concentrations for cluster-mass
halos, finding mass (1.3+/-0.2)x10^{14} M_{sun}/h for the sample of LRGs
brighter than -22.6 in r. (Abridged)",2006-05-18T23:42:44Z
Delayed X- and Gamma-Ray Line Emission from Solar Flare Radioactivity,"We have studied the radioactive line emission expected from solar active
regions after large flares, following the production of long-lived
radioisotopes by nuclear interactions of flare-accelerated ions. This delayed
X- and gamma-ray line emission can provide unique information on the
accelerated particle composition and energy spectrum, as well as on mixing
processes in the solar atmosphere. Total cross sections for the formation of
the main radioisotopes by proton, 3-He and alpha-particle reactions are
evaluated from available data combined with nuclear reaction theory.
Thick-target radioisotope yields are provided in tabular form, which can be
used to predict fluxes of all of the major delayed lines at any time after a
gamma-ray flare. The brightest delayed line for days after the flare is found
to be the 511 keV positron-electron annihilation line resulting from the decay
of several beta+ radioisotopes. After ~2 days however, the flux of the 511 keV
line can become lower than that of the 846.8 keV line from the decay of 56-Co.
Our study has revealed other delayed gamma-ray lines that appear to be
promising for detection, e.g. at 1434 keV from the radioactivity of both the
isomer and the ground state of 52-Mn, 1332 and 1792 keV from 60-Cu, and 931.1
keV from 55-Co. The strongest delayed X-ray line is found to be the Co Kalpha
at 6.92 keV, which is produced from both the decay of the isomer of 58-Co by
the conversion of a K-shell electron and the decay of 57-Ni by orbital electron
capture. Prospects for observation of these lines with RHESSI or future space
instruments are discussed.",2006-04-14T09:14:38Z
"Thermal Stability of White Dwarfs Accreting Hydrogen-rich Matter and
  Progenitors of Type Ia Supernovae","We revisit the properties of white dwarfs accreting hydrogen-rich matter by
constructing steady-state models, in which hydrogen shell burning consumes
hydrogen at the same rate as the white dwarf accretes it. We obtain such
steady-state models for various accretion rates and white dwarf masses. We
confirm that these steady models are thermally stable only when the accretion
rate is higher than \sim 10^{-7} M_sun/yr. We show that recent models of
``quiescent burning'' in the ``surface hydrogen burning'' at a much wider range
of accretion rates results from the too large zone mass in the outer part of
the models; hydrogen burning must occur in a much thinner layer. A comparison
of the positions on the HR diagram suggests that most of the luminous supersoft
X-ray sources are white dwarfs accreting matter at rates high enough that the
hydrogen burning shell is thermally stable. Implications on the progenitors of
Type Ia supernovae are discussed.",2006-03-14T14:52:51Z
"Phenomenological Modeling of the FIR-Radio Correlation within Nearby
  Galaxies","We present an analysis of the far-infrared (FIR)-radio correlation within a
group of nearby star-forming galaxy disks observed as part of the {\it Spitzer}
Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS). In our study we critically test a
phenomenological model for the FIR-radio correlation which describes the radio
image as a smeared version of the infrared image. The physical basis for this
model is that cosmic-ray electrons (CR electrons) will diffuse significant
distances from their originating sources before decaying by synchrotron
emission. We find that this description generally works well, improving the
correlation between the radio and infrared images of our four sample galaxies
by an average factor of $\sim$1.6. We also find that the best-fit smearing
kernels seem to show a dependence on the ongoing star formation activity within
each disk. Galaxies having lower star formation activity (NGC 2403 and NGC
3031) are best-fit using larger smearing kernels than galaxies with more active
star-forming disks (NGC 5194 and NGC 6946). We attribute this trend to be due
to a recent deficit of CR electron injection into the interstellar medium of
galaxies with lower star formation activity throughout their disks.",2006-03-15T20:03:59Z
Very High Energy Gamma-Ray Observations with H.E.S.S,"The H.E.S.S. Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope Array is currently the
most sensitive instrument for Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray observations in
the energy range of about 0.1-10 TeV. During more than two years of operation
with the complete 4-telescope array, many galactic and extragalactic VHE
gamma-ray sources have been discovered. With its superior sensitivity and its
large field-of-view camera, H.E.S.S. is particularly suited for surveys and
detailed studies of extended sources. A selection of recent H.E.S.S. results is
presented in this proceeding.",2006-06-20T15:17:41Z
The gamma-ray burst monitor for Lobster-ISS,"Lobster-ISS is an X-ray all-sky monitor experiment selected by ESA two years
ago for a Phase A study (now almost completed) for a future flight (2009)
aboard the Columbus Exposed Payload Facility of the International Space
Station. The main instrument, based on MCP optics with Lobster-eye geometry,
has an energy passband from 0.1 to 3.5 keV, an unprecedented daily sensitivity
of 2x10^{-12} erg cm^{-2}s$^{-1}, and it is capable to scan, during each orbit,
the entire sky with an angular resolution of 4--6 arcmin. This X-ray telescope
is flanked by a Gamma Ray Burst Monitor, with the minimum requirement of
recognizing true GRBs from other transient events. In this paper we describe
the GRBM. In addition to the minimum requirement, the instrument proposed is
capable to roughly localize GRBs which occur in the Lobster FOV (162x22.5
degrees) and to significantly extend the scientific capabilities of the main
instrument for the study of GRBs and X-ray transients. The combination of the
two instruments will allow an unprecedented spectral coverage (from 0.1 up to
300/700 keV) for a sensitive study of the GRB prompt emission in the passband
where GRBs and X-Ray Flashes emit most of their energy. The low-energy spectral
band (0.1-10 keV) is of key importance for the study of the GRB environment and
the search of transient absorption and emission features from GRBs, both goals
being crucial for unveiling the GRB phenomenon. The entire energy band of
Lobster-ISS is not covered by either the Swift satellite or other GRB missions
foreseen in the next decade.",2006-05-11T16:49:38Z
Oscillations of longitudinally density stratified coronal loops,"We investigate the standing kink modes of a cylindrical model of coronal
loops. The density is stratified along the loop axis and changes
discontinuously at the surface of the cylinder. The periods and mode profiles
are studies with their deviation from those of the unstratified loops. The aim
is to extract information on the density scale heights prevailing in the solar
corona. The problem is reduced to solving a single second-order partial
differential equation for $\delta B_z(r,z)$, the longitudinal component of the
Eulerian perturbations of the magnetic field. This equation, in turn, is
separated into two second-order ordinary, differential equations in $r$ and $z$
that are, however, connected through a dispersion relation between the
frequencies and the longitudinal wave numbers. In the thin tube approximation,
the eigensolutions are obtained by a perturbation technique, where the
perturbation parameter is the density stratification parameter. Otherwise the
problem is solved numerically.",2006-05-22T16:22:45Z
Effects of alpha particles on the angular momentum loss from the Sun,"The classic Weber-Davis model of the solar wind is reconsidered by
incorporating alpha particles and by allowing the solar wind to flow out of the
equatorial plane in an axisymmetrical configuration. In the ion momentum
equations of the solar wind, the ion gyro-frequency is many orders of magnitude
higher than any other frequency. This requires that the difference between
proton and alpha velocity vectors be aligned with the background magnetic
field. With the aid of this alignment condition, the governing equations of the
multi-fluid solar wind are derived from the standard transport equations. The
governing equations are numerically solved along a prescribed meridional
magnetic field line located at colatitude $70^\circ$ at 1AU and a steady state
fast solar wind solution is found. A general analysis concludes, in agreement
with the Weber-Davis model, that the magnetic field helps the coronal plasma to
achieve an effective corotation out to the Alfv\'enic radius, where the
poloidal Alfv\'enic Mach number $M_T$ equals unity ($M_T$ is defined by
equation (\ref{eq:mach})). The model computations show that, magnetic stresses
predominate the angular momentum loss of the Sun. For the fast wind considered,
the proton contribution to the angular momentum loss, which can be larger than
the magnetic one, is almost completely canceled by the alpha particles that
develop an azimuthal speed in the direction opposite to the solar rotation. The
Poynting flux associated with the azimuthal components is negligible in the
energy budget. However, the solar rotation can play some role in reducing the
relative speed between alpha particles and protons for low latitude fast solar
wind streams in interplanetary space.",2006-06-07T13:53:48Z
"Constraints on holographic dark energy models using the differential
  ages of passively evolving galaxies","Using the absolute ages of passively evolving galaxies observed at different
redshifts, one can obtain the differential ages, the derivative of redshift $z$
with respect to the cosmic time $t$ (i.e. ${\rm d} z/{\rm d}t$). Thus, the
Hubble parameter $H(z)$ can be measured through the relation $H(z)=-({\rm d}
z/{\rm d}t)/(1+z)$. By comparing the measured Hubble parameter at different
redshifts with the theoretical one containing free cosmological parameters, one
can constrain current cosmological models. In this paper, we use this method to
present the constraint on a spatially flat Friedman-Robert-Walker Universe with
a matter component and a holographic dark energy component, in which the
parameter $c$ plays a significant role in this dark energy model. Firstly we
consider three fixed values of $c$=0.6, 1.0 and 1.4 in the fitting of data. If
we set $c$ free, the best fitting values are $c=0.26$, $\Omega_{\rm m0}=0.16$,
$h=0.9998$. It is shown that the holographic dark energy behaves like a
quintom-type at the $1\sigma$ level. This result is consistent with some other
independent cosmological constrains, which imply that $c<1.0$ is favored. We
also test the results derived from the differential ages using another
independent method based on the lookback time to galaxy clusters and the age of
the universe. It shows that our results are reliable.",2006-05-23T17:48:10Z
"Rotation speed and stellar axis inclination from p modes: How CoRoT
  would see other suns","In the context of future space-based asteroseismic missions, we have studied
the problem of extracting the rotation speed and the rotation-axis inclination
of solar-like stars from the expected data. We have focused on slow rotators
(at most twice solar rotation speed), firstly because they constitute the most
difficult case and secondly because some of the CoRoT main targets are expected
to have slow rotation rates. Our study of the likelihood function has shown a
correlation between the estimates of inclination of the rotation axis i and the
rotational splitting deltanu of the star. By using the parameters, i and
deltanu*=deltanu sin(i), we propose and discuss new fitting strategies. Monte
Carlo simulations have shown that we can extract a mean splitting and the
rotation-axis inclination down to solar rotation rates. However, at the solar
rotation rate we are not able to correctly recover the angle i although we are
still able to measure a correct deltanu* with a dispersion less than 40 nHz.",2006-03-24T14:52:51Z
Pulsar twinkling and relativity,"The number of pulsars with detected emission at X-ray and gamma-ray energies
has been steadily growing, showing that beams of high-energy particles are
commonly accelerated in pulsar magnetospheres, even though the location and
number of acceleration sites remain unsettled. Acceleration near the magnetic
poles, close to the polar cap surface or to higher altitudes in the slot gap
along the last open field lines, involves an electric field component due to
inertial-frame dragging. Acceleration can also take place in the outer
magnetosphere where charge depletion due to global currents causes a large
electric field along the magnetic field lines. All models require a detailed
knowledge of the open magnetosphere geometry and its relativistic distortions.
Observational trends with age, spin-down power and magnetic field as well as
population synthesis studies in the Galactic disc and the nearby Gould Belt
provide useful, however not yet conclusive, constraints on the competing
models.",2006-04-04T19:40:16Z
"The U-shaped distribution of globular cluster specific frequencies in a
  biased globular cluster formation scenario","Using high-resolution numerical simulations, we investigate mass- and
luminosity-normalized specific frequencies (T_N and S_N, respectively) of
globular cluster systems (GCSs) in order to understand the origin of the
observed U-shaped relation between S_N and V-band magnitude (M_V) of their host
galaxies.
  We adopt a biased GC formation scenario in which GC formation is truncated in
galaxy halos that are virialized at a later redshift, z_trun. T_N is derived
for galaxies with GCs today and converted into S_N for reasonable galaxy
mass-to-light-ratios (M/L). We find that T_N depends on halo mass (M_h) in the
sense that T_N can be larger in more massive halos with M_h > 10^9 M_sun, if
z_trun is as high as 15. We however find that the dependence is too weak to
explain the observed S_N-M_V relation and the wide range of S_N in low-mass
early-type galaxies with -20.5 < M_V < -16.0 mag for a reasonable constant M/L.
The M_V-dependence of S_N for the low-mass galaxies can be well reproduced, if
the mass-to-light-ratio M_h/L_V \propto M_h^{\alpha}, where \alpha is as steep
as -1. Based on these results, we propose that the origin of the observed
U-shaped S_N-M_V relation of GCSs can be understood in terms of the bimodality
in the dependence of M_h/L_V on M_h of their host galaxies. We also suggest
that the observed large dispersionin S_N in low-mass galaxies is due partly to
the large dispersion in T_N.",2006-05-23T10:57:26Z

Using cosmology to constrain the topology of hidden dimensions,"A four-dimensional universe, arising from a flux compactification of Type IIB
string theory, contains scalar fields with a potential determined by
topological and geometric parameters of the internal -hidden- dimensions. We
show that inflation can be realized via rolling towards the large internal
volume minima that are generic in these scenarios, and we give explicit
formulae relating the microscopic parameters (e.g., the Euler number of the
internal space) to the cosmological observables (e.g., the spectral index). We
find that the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the running of the spectral index, and
the potential energy density at the minimum are related by consistency
relations and are exponentially small in the number of e-foldings. Further,
requiring that these models arise as low-energy limits of string theory
eliminates most of them, even if they are phenomenologically valid. In this
context, this approach provides a strategy for systematically falsifying
stringy inflation models.",2006-05-15T22:20:50Z
"Why your model parameter confidences might be too optimistic -- unbiased
  estimation of the inverse covariance matrix","AIMS. The maximum-likelihood method is the standard approach to obtain model
fits to observational data and the corresponding confidence regions. We
investigate possible sources of bias in the log-likelihood function and its
subsequent analysis, focusing on estimators of the inverse covariance matrix.
Furthermore, we study under which circumstances the estimated covariance matrix
is invertible. METHODS. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the
behaviour of estimators for the inverse covariance matrix, depending on the
number of independent data sets and the number of variables of the data
vectors. RESULTS. We find that the inverse of the maximum-likelihood estimator
of the covariance is biased, the amount of bias depending on the ratio of the
number of bins (data vector variables), P, to the number of data sets, N. This
bias inevitably leads to an -- in extreme cases catastrophic -- underestimation
of the size of confidence regions. We report on a method to remove this bias
for the idealised case of Gaussian noise and statistically independent data
vectors. Moreover, we demonstrate that marginalisation over parameters
introduces a bias into the marginalised log-likelihood function. Measures of
the sizes of confidence regions suffer from the same problem. Furthermore, we
give an analytic proof for the fact that the estimated covariance matrix is
singular if P>N.",2006-08-02T15:21:52Z
"The Discovery of Three New z>5 Quasars in the AGN and Galaxy Evolution
  Survey","We present the discovery of three z>5 quasars in the AGN and Galaxy Evolution
Survey (AGES) spectroscopic observations of the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey
(NDWFS) Bootes Field. These quasars were selected as part of a larger Spitzer
mid-infrared quasar sample with no selection based on optical colors. The
highest redshift object, NDWFS J142516.3+325409, z=5.85, is the
lowest-luminosity z>5.8 quasar currently known. We compare mid-infrared
techniques for identifying z>5 quasars to more traditional optical techniques
and show that mid-infrared colors allow for selection of high-redshift quasars
even at redshifts where quasars lie near the optical stellar locus and at z>7
where optical selection is impossible. Using the superb multi-wavelength
coverage available in the NDWFS Bootes field, we construct the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of high-redshift quasars from observed Bw-band to 24
microns (rest-frame 600 Angstroms - 3.7 microns). We show that the three
high-redshift quasars have quite similar SEDs, and the rest-frame composite SED
of low-redshift quasars from the literature shows little evolution compared to
our high-redshift objects. We compare the number of z>5 quasars we have
discovered to the expected number from published quasar luminosity functions.
While analyses of the quasar luminosity function are tenuous based on only
three objects, we find that a relatively steep luminosity function with Psi
L^(-3.2) provides the best agreement with the number of high-redshift quasars
discovered in our survey.",2006-05-01T16:48:22Z
"Robust Machine Learning Applied to Astronomical Datasets I: Star-Galaxy
  Classification of the SDSS DR3 Using Decision Trees","We provide classifications for all 143 million non-repeat photometric objects
in the Third Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) using decision
trees trained on 477,068 objects with SDSS spectroscopic data. We demonstrate
that these star/galaxy classifications are expected to be reliable for
approximately 22 million objects with r < ~20. The general machine learning
environment Data-to-Knowledge and supercomputing resources enabled extensive
investigation of the decision tree parameter space. This work presents the
first public release of objects classified in this way for an entire SDSS data
release. The objects are classified as either galaxy, star or nsng (neither
star nor galaxy), with an associated probability for each class. To demonstrate
how to effectively make use of these classifications, we perform several
important tests. First, we detail selection criteria within the probability
space defined by the three classes to extract samples of stars and galaxies to
a given completeness and efficiency. Second, we investigate the efficacy of the
classifications and the effect of extrapolating from the spectroscopic regime
by performing blind tests on objects in the SDSS, 2dF Galaxy Redshift and 2dF
QSO Redshift (2QZ) surveys. Given the photometric limits of our spectroscopic
training data, we effectively begin to extrapolate past our star-galaxy
training set at r ~ 18. By comparing the number counts of our training sample
with the classified sources, however, we find that our efficiencies appear to
remain robust to r ~ 20. As a result, we expect our classifications to be
accurate for 900,000 galaxies and 6.7 million stars, and remain robust via
extrapolation for a total of 8.0 million galaxies and 13.9 million stars.

Quasar Structure and Cosmological Feedback,"Feedback from quasars and AGNs is being invoked frequently in several
cosmological settings. Currently, order of magnitude, or more, uncertainties in
the structure of both the wind and the 'obscuring torus' make predictions
highly uncertain. To make testable models of this 'cosmological feedback' it is
essential to understand the detailed structure of AGNs sufficiently well to
predict their properties for the whole quasar population, at all redshifts.
Progress in both areas is rapid, and I describe the near-term prospects for
reducing these uncertainties for 'slow' (non-relativistic) AGN winds and the
obscuring torus.",2006-06-05T21:59:36Z
A Panoramic Mid-infrared Survey of Two Distant Clusters,"(abridged) We present panoramic Spitzer MIPS 24um observations covering
9x9Mpc (25'x25') fields around two massive clusters, Cl0024+16 and MS0451-03,
at z=0.39 and z=0.55. Our observations cover a very wide range of environments
within these clusters, from high-density regions around the cores out to the
turn-around radius. Cross-correlating the mid-infrared catalogs with deep
optical and near-infrared imaging of these fields, we investigate the
optical/near-infrared colors of the mid-infrared sources. We find excesses of
mid-infrared sources with optical/near-infrared colors expected of cluster
members in the two clusters and test this selection using spectroscopically
confirmed 24um members. The much more significant excess is associated with
Cl0024+16, whereas MS0451-03 has comparatively few mid-infrared sources. The
mid-infrared galaxy population in Cl0024+16 appears to be associated with dusty
star-forming galaxies (typically redder than the general cluster population by
up to A_V~1-2 mags) rather than emission from dusty tori around active galactic
nuclei (AGN) in early-type hosts. The inferred total-infrared star-formation
rates in Cl0024+16 are typically >5x greater than those found from a similar
Halpha survey, indicating significant obscured activity in the cluster
population. We find evidence for strong evolution of the level of dust-obscured
star-formation in dense environments out to z=0.5, analogous to the rise in
fraction of optically-selected star-forming galaxies seen in clusters and the
field out to similar redshifts. However, there are clearly significant
cluster-to-cluster variations in the populations of mid-infrared sources,
probably reflecting differences in the intracluster media and recent dynamical
evolution of these systems.",2006-06-06T11:06:54Z
"A Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) Spectral Sequence of M, L, and T
  Dwarfs","We present a low-resolution (R = 90), 5.5-38 micron spectral sequence of a
sample of M, L, and T dwarfs obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS)
onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. The spectra exhibit prominent absorption
bands of H_2O at 6.27 microns, CH_4 at 7.65 microns, and NH_3 at 10.5 microns
and are relatively featureless at lambda > 15 microns. Three spectral indices
that measure the strengths of these bands are presented; H_2O absorption
features are present throughout the MLT sequence while the CH_4 and NH_3 bands
first appear at roughly the L/T transition. Although the spectra are, in
general, qualitatively well matched by synthetic spectra that include the
formation of spatially homogeneous silicate and iron condensate clouds, the
spectra of the mid-type L dwarfs show an unexpected flattening from roughly 9
to 11 microns. We hypothesize that this may be a result of a population of
small silicate grains that are not predicted in the cloud models. The spectrum
of the peculiar T6 dwarf 2MASS J0937+2931 is suppressed from 5.5-7.5 microns
relative to typical T6 dwarfs and may be a consequence of its mildly
metal-poor/high surface gravity atmosphere. Finally, we compute bolometric
luminosities of a subsample of the M, L, and T dwarfs by combining the IRS
spectra with previously published 0.6-4.1 micron spectra and find good
agreement with the values of Golimowski et al. who use L'- and M'-band
photometry and to account for the flux emitted at lambda > 2.5 microns.",2006-05-24T20:51:56Z

"Air-Showers in Space and Z-Showers in Universe for Neutrino Astronomy
  and Spectroscopy","Amplified Tau-airshower at horizons may well open a novel powerful windows,
at PeV-EeV energy, to Neutrino Astronomy. Neutrino induced air-showering
astronomy rise because of neutrino masses, their mixing and the consequent
replenishment of tau flavor during neutrino flight into spaces; Tau-Air-Showers
escaping the Earth are the main traces amplified by its millions muon, billions
gamma and thousand billions photon secondaries. Earth edges and its sharp
shadows is the huge beam-dump detector for UHE neutrino and the almost
noise-free screen for tau air-showers (as well as for PeVs anti-neutrino
electron scattering on air electrons by resonant interactions). Crown array
detectors for horizontal Cherenkov signals on mountains, on balloons and
satellites widening the solid angle view are being elaborated; deep and wide
valleys are considered. MAGIC Telescopes pointing downward to terrestrial
grounds acts, for EeV Tau neutrino air-showers astronomy, as a massive tens of
km^3 water equivalent detector, making (in a given direction) it at present the
most powerful dedicated neutrino telescope at PeVs. MAGIC facing the sea edges
must also reveal mirrored downward UHECR Air-showers (Cherenkov) flashes.
Magic-crown systems may lead to largest neutrino detectors in near future. They
maybe located on top mountains, on planes or balloons or in satellite arrays.
They may be screened in deep valleys. MILAGRO (and past MILAGRITO or future
larger detectors) on a mountain top might already hide records of horizontal
up-going muon bundles due to far UHECR and less far (but rarer) tau air-showers

"AEGIS: Enhancement of Dust-enshrouded Star Formation in Close Galaxy
  Pairs and Merging Galaxies up to z ~ 1","Using data from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey and HST/ACS imaging in the
Extended Groth Strip, we select nearly 100 interacting galaxy systems including
kinematic close pairs and morphologically identified merging galaxies. Spitzer
MIPS 24 micron fluxes of these systems reflect the current dusty star formation
activity, and at a fixed stellar mass (M_{*}) the median infrared luminosity
(L_{IR}) among merging galaxies and close pairs of blue galaxies is twice (1.9
+/- 0.4) that of control pairs drawn from isolated blue galaxies. Enhancement
declines with galaxy separation, being strongest in close pairs and mergers and
weaker in wide pairs compared to the control sample. At z ~ 0.9, 7.1% +/- 4.3%
of massive interacting galaxies (M_{*} > 2*10^{10} M_{solar}) are found to be
ULIRGs, compared to 2.6% +/- 0.7% in the control sample. The large spread of IR
luminosity to stellar mass ratio among interacting galaxies suggests that this
enhancement may depend on the merger stage as well as other as yet unidentified
factors (e.g., galaxy structure, mass ratio, orbital characteristics, presence
of AGN or bar). The contribution of interacting systems to the total IR
luminosity density is moderate (<= 36 %).",2006-07-13T03:05:10Z
Dark energy constraints from lensing-detected galaxy clusters,"We study the ability of weak lensing surveys to detect galaxy clusters and
constrain cosmological parameters, in particular the equation of state of dark
energy. There are two major sources of noise for weak lensing cluster
measurements: the ``shape noise'' from the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies;
and the large scale projection noise. We produce a filter for the shear field
which optimizes the signal-to-noise of shape-noise-dominated shear
measurements. Our Fisher-matrix analysis of this projected-mass observable
makes use of the shape of this mass function, and takes into account the
Poisson variance, sample variance, shape noise, and projected-mass noise, and
also the fact that the conversion of the shear signal into mass is
cosmology-dependent. The Fisher analysis is applied to both a nominal 15,000
square degree ground-based survey and a 1000 square degree space-based survey.
Assuming a detection threshold of S/N=5, we find both experiments detect
\~20,000 clusters, and yield 1-sigma constraints of ~0.07 for w0 and ~0.2 for
wa when combined with CMB data (for flat universe). The projection noise
exceeds the shape noise only for clusters at z<=0.1 and has little effect on
the derived dark-energy constraints. Sample variance does not significantly
affect either survey. Finally, we note that all these results are extremely
sensitive to the noise levels and detection thresholds that we impose. They can
be significantly improved if we combine ground and space surveys as independent

Resolved Stellar Populations at the Distance of Virgo,"Top of the wish list of any astronomer who wants to understand galaxy
formation and evolution is to resolve the stellar populations of a sample of
giant elliptical galaxies: to take spectra of the stars and make
Colour-Magnitude Diagrams going down to the oldest main sequence turn-offs. It
is only by measuring the relative numbers of stars on Main Sequence Turnoffs at
ages ranging back to the time of the earliest star formation in the Universe
that we can obtain unambiguous star formation histories. Understanding star
formation histories of individual galaxies underpins all our theories of galaxy
formation and evolution. To date we only have detailed star formation histories
for the nearest-by objects in the Local Group, namely galaxies within 700kpc of
our own. This means predominantly small diffuse dwarf galaxies in a poor group
environment. To sample the full range of galaxy types and to consider galaxies
in a high density environment (where much mass in the Universe resides) we need
to be able to resolve stars at the distance of the Virgo (~17Mpc) or Fornax
(~18Mpc) clusters. This ambitious goal requires an Extremely Large Telescope
(ELT), with a diameter of 50-150m, operating in the optical/near-IR at its
diffraction limit.",2006-04-04T15:11:05Z
"Dynamical Formation of the Dark Molecular Hydrogen Clouds around Diffuse
  HII Regions","We examine the triggering process of molecular cloud formation around diffuse
HII regions. We calculate the time evolution of the shell as well as of the HII
region in a two-phase neutral medium, solving the UV and FUV radiative
transfer, the thermal and chemical processes in the time-dependent
hydrodynamics code. In the cold neutral medium, the ambient gas is swept up in
the cold (T \sim 30-40K) and dense (n \sim 10^3 cm^-3) shell around the HII
region. In the shell, H_2 molecules are formed from the swept-up HI gas, but CO
molecules are hardly formed. The reformation of H_2 molecules is more efficient
with a higher-mass central star. The physical and chemical properties of gas in
the shell are just intermediate between those of the neutral medium and
molecular clouds observed by the CO emission. The dense shell with cold HI/H_2
gas easily becomes gravitationally unstable, and breaks up into small clouds.
The cooling layer just behind the shock front also suffers from thermal
instability, and will fragment into cloudlets with some translational motions.
We suggest that the predicted cold ``dark'' HI/H_2 gas should be detected as
the HI self-absorption (HISA) feature. We have sought such features in recent
observational data, and found shell-like HISA features around the giant HII
regions, W4 and W5. The shell-like HISA feature shows good spatial correlation
with dust emission, but poor correlation with CO emission. Our quantitative
analysis shows that the HISA cloud can be as cold as T \sim a few x 10K.

"SPITZER Observations of z~3 Lyman Break Galaxies: stellar masses and
  mid-infrared properties","We describe the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of Lyman Break Galaxies
(LBGs) at z~3 using deep mid-infrared and optical observations of the Extended
Groth Strip, obtained with IRAC and MIPS on board Spitzer and from the ground,
respectively. We focus on LBGs with detections at all four IRAC bands, in
particular the 26 galaxies with IRAC 8 micron band (rest--frame K-band)
detections. We use stellar population synthesis models and probe the stellar
content of these galaxies. Based on best--fit continuous star-formation models
we derive estimates of the stellar mass for these LBGs. As in previous studies,
we find that a fraction of LBGs have very red colors and large estimated
stellar masses (M_stellar > 5 x 10 ^{10} M_solar): the present Spitzer data
allow us, for the first time, to study these massive LBGs in detail. We discuss
the link between these LBGs and submm-luminous galaxies.We find that the number
density of these massive LBGs at high redshift is higher than predicted by
current semi-analytic models of galaxy evolution.",2006-05-15T11:09:07Z
Description of Stellar Acoustic Modes Using the Local Wave Concept,"An understanding of stellar acoustic oscillations is attempted, using the
local wave concept in semi-analytical calculations. The local homogeneity
approximation allows to obtain simplified equations that can nevertheless
describe the wave behavior down to the central region, as the gravitational
potential perturbation is not neglected. Acoustic modes are calculated as
classical standing waves in a cavity, by determining the cavity limits and the
wave phases at these limits. The internal boundary condition is determined by a
fitting with an Airy function. The external boundary condition is defined as
the limit where the spatial variation of the background is important compared
to the wavelength. This overall procedure is in accordance with the JWKB
approximation. When comparing the results with numerical calculations, some
drawbacks of the isothermal atmosphere approximation are revealed. When
comparing with seismic observations of the Sun, possible improvements at the
surface of solar models are suggested. The present semi-analytical method can
potentially predict eigenfrequencies at the precision of +-3microHz in the
range 800-5600 microHz, for the degrees l=0-10. A numerical calculation using
the same type of external boundary conditions could reach a global agreement
with observations better than 1 microHz. This approach could contribute to
better determine the absolute values of eigenfrequencies for asteroseismology.",2006-06-26T14:34:59Z
The Kinematic and Spectral Ages of the Compact Radio Source CTD 93,"We present a study of the kinematic and spectral ages of the Gigahertz-Peaked
Spectrum (GPS) source CTD~93. Measurements of the hot spot separation over 8.5
yr show evidence of an increase. The separation rate along the source axis is
0.34$\pm0.11c$ (H$_{0}$=72 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), which results in a
kinematic age of 2200$\pm$700 yr. Assuming that two hot spots are moving apart
at equal speeds, we derive an advance speed of 0.17$\pm0.06c$. The radio lobe
spectra show a high frequency steepening, as expected if energetic electrons
lose energy by synchrotron radiation. The spectral break decreases with the
distance from the hot spot in the northern component of CTD~93. This tendency
is expected from the basic scenario of radio lobe evolution involving particle
acceleration at the hot spots, with the radio lobes populated by high energy
electrons which have leaked from the hot spots. Although a core-jet morphology
for CTD~93 has previously been proposed, these results indicate that the
morphology is similar to that of Compact Symmetric Object (CSO). From the
spectral fits in the northern component we found a break frequency of 3.7 GHz
at the edge of the lobe. The resultant spectral age is $\sim$300 yr assuming
the equipartition magnetic field. This requires the advance speed of 0.26$c$,
which shows a good agreement of the hot spot motion of 0.17$\pm0.06c$. Our
results strongly support the hypothesis that CSOs are young radio sources.",2006-05-12T08:08:33Z
"Minkowski's Object: A Starburst Triggered by a Radio Jet, Revisited","We present neutral hydrogen, ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared imaging,
and optical spectroscopy, of Minkowski's Object (MO), a star forming peculiar
galaxy near NGC 541. The observations strengthen evidence that star formation
in MO was triggered by the radio jet from NGC 541. Key new results are the
discovery of a 4.9E8 solar mass double HI cloud straddling the radio jet
downstream from MO, where the jet changes direction and decollimates; strong
detections of MO, also showing double structure, in UV and H-alpha; and
numerous HII regions and associated clusters in MO. In UV, MO resembles the
radio-aligned, rest-frame UV morphologies in many high redshift radio galaxies
(HzRGs), also thought to be caused by jet-induced star formation. MO's stellar
population is dominated by a 7.5 Myr-old, 1.9E7 solar mass instantaneous burst,
with current star formation rate 0.52 solar masses per year (concentrated
upstream from where the HI column density is high). This is unlike the
jet-induced star formation in Centaurus A, where the jet interacts with
pre-existing cold gas; in MO the HI may have cooled out of a warmer, clumpy
intergalactic or interstellar medium as a result of jet interaction, followed
by collapse of the cooling clouds and subsequent star formation (consistent
with numerical simulations). Since the radio source that triggered star
formation in MO is much less luminous, and therefore more common, than powerful
HzRGs, and because the environment around MO is not particularly special in
terms of abundant dense, cold gas, jet-induced star formation in the early
universe might be even more prevalent than previously thought.",2006-04-27T00:45:37Z
The Dissipative Merger Progenitors of Elliptical Galaxies,"We address the deviations of the scaling relations of elliptical galaxies
from the expectations based on the virial theorem and homology, including the
""tilt"" of the ""fundamental plane"" and the steep decline of density with mass.
We show that such tilts result from dissipative major mergers once the gas
fraction available for dissipation declines with progenitor mass, and derive
the scaling properties of the progenitors. We use hydrodynamical simulations to
quantify the effects of major mergers with different gas fractions on the
structural properties of galaxies. The tilts are driven by the differential
shrinkage of the effective stellar radius as a function of dissipation in the
merger, while the correlated smaller enhancements in internal velocity and
stellar mass keep the slope of the velocity-stellar mass relation near V \pr
M_*^{1/4}. The progenitors match a straightforward model of disc formation in
LCDM haloes. Their total to stellar mass ratio within the effective radius
varies as M/M_* \pr M_*^-0.25, consistent with supernova feedback. They are
nearly homologous in the sense that the dark-matter fractions within the
effective and virial radii scale with mass in a similar way, with only a weak
decline of density with mass. The progenitor radius is roughly R \pr M_*^0.3,
compatible with today's intermediate late-type galaxies. This indicates that
the latest wet mergers involved relatively big discs. The dissipative gas to
stellar mass ratio is predicted to decline \pr M_*^-0.5, similar to the
observed trend in today's blue sequence galaxies. Such a trend should be
observed in relatively massive gaseous galaxies at z~1-4. The corresponding
""baryonic"" relations are consistent with homology and spherical virial
equilibrium, V \pr R \pr M_b^1/3.",2006-03-20T15:11:08Z
Stability of Magnetic Equilibria in Radio Balloons,"Current-carrying flows, in the laboratory and in astrophysical jets, can form
remarkably stable magnetic structures. Decades of experience shows that such
flows often build equilibria that reverse field directions, evolving to an MHD
Taylor state, which has remarkable stability properties. We model jets and the
magnetic bubbles they build as reversed field pinch equilibria by assuming the
driver current to be stiff in the MHD sense. Taking the jet current as rigid
and a fixed function of position, we prove a theorem: that the same, simple MHD
stability conditions guarantee stability, even after the jet turns off. This
means that magnetic structures harboring a massive inventory of magnetic energy
can persist long after the building jet current has died away. These may be the
relic radio ""fossils,"" ""ghost bubbles"" or ""magnetic balloons"" found in
clusters. These equilibria under magnetic tension will evolve, retaining the
stability properties from that state. The remaining fossil is not a disordered
ball of magnetic fields, but a stable structure under tension, able to respond
to the slings and arrows of outside forces. Typically their Alfven speeds
greatly exceed the cluster sound speed, and so can keep out hot cluster
plasmas, leading to x-ray ""ghosts."" Passing shocks cannot easily destroy them,
but can energize and light them up anew at radio frequencies. Bubbles can rise
in the hot cluster plasma, perhaps detaching from the parent radio galaxy, yet
stable against Rayleigh-Taylor and other modes.",2006-05-10T20:39:18Z
Galactic Nuclei and Jets in Wave Gravity,"""Wave gravity"" refers to a quantum-mechanical gravity theory introduced in
two previous papers [1,2]. Although based on the optics of de Broglie waves
instead of curved space-time, it agrees with the standard tests of general
relativity. As in that theory, galactic nuclei are dark objects where gravity
prevents the escape of most radiation. In this case, collapse is counteracted
by rising internal pressure and black hole singularities don't occur. Unlike
black holes, these nuclei can have internal magnetic fields, and high-energy
plasma can escape along magnetic field lines closely aligned with the
gravitational field direction. This allows a different model of jets from
active galactic nuclei, where jets can arise without direct fueling by
accretion disks. It also offers a new basis for the tight correlation observed
[13] between the masses of galactic nuclei and their hosts.",2006-06-20T17:35:16Z
"About universes with scale-related total masses and their abolition of
  presently outstanding cosmological problems","Cosmological consequences of a strictly valid total energy conservation for
the whole universe are investigated in this paper. Interestingly enough as one
consequence of ergodically behaving universes very specific scaling laws with
the diameter R of the universe can be derived for relevant cosmic quantities.
Especially the 1/R^2- scaling of mass - and vacuum energy - density then
automatically leads to a vanishing cosmic curvature parameter k=0 and also
reveals, that for such universes no horizon problem occurs. In addition the
longstanding problem of observationally indicated very low cosmic vacuum
energies in contrast to the very large quantumfield estimates is easily solved
when the vacuum energy density decay with 1/R^2 is taken into account
reconciling presently observed vacuum energy density values with those from
theoretical expectations. We also suggest why the mass of the universe can
permanently increase and can in fact grow up from a Planck mass as a pure
vacuum fluctuation.",2006-06-02T11:55:44Z
Dark viscous fluid described by a unified equation of state in cosmology,"We generalize the $\Lambda$CDM model by introducing a unified EOS to describe
the Universe contents modeled as dark viscous fluid, motivated by the fact that
a single constant equation of state (EOS) $p=-p_0$ ($p_0>0$) reproduces the
$\Lambda$CDM model exactly. This EOS describes the perfect fluid term, the
dissipative effect, and the cosmological constant in a unique framework and the
Friedmann equations can be analytically solved. Especially, we find a relation
between the EOS parameter and the renormalizable condition of a scalar field.
We develop a completely numerical method to perform a $\chi^2$ minimization to
constrain the parameters in a cosmological model directly from the Friedmann
equations, and employ the SNe data with the parameter $\mathcal{A}$ measured
from the SDSS data to constrain our model. The result indicates that the
dissipative effect is rather small in the late-time Universe.",2006-04-30T03:27:31Z
Discovery of the low-energy cutoff in a powerful giant radio galaxy,"The lobes of radio galaxies and quasars, fed by jets and hotspots, represent
a significant, and currently ill-constrained, source of energy input into the
inter-galactic medium (IGM). How much energy is input into the IGM depends on
the minimum energy to which the power-law distribution of relativistic
particles is accelerated in the hotspots. This has hitherto been unknown to
within three orders of magnitude. We present direct evidence for the discovery
of this low-energy cutoff in the lobe of a Mpc-sized radio galaxy via the
existence of extended X-ray emission, inverse-Compton scattered from aged radio
plasma, and its separation by 80kpc from regions containing freshly accelerated
plasma from the hotspot. The low-energy cutoff of gamma ~ 10^4 in the hotspot
is higher than previously thought, but reconciles discrepancies with magnetic
field estimates which had been systematically lower than equipartition values.
The inverse Compton scattering of the spent synchrotron plasma is at the
expense of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons; we comment on the
importance of such giant radio galaxies as contaminants of CMB anisotropies.",2006-05-16T15:05:38Z
Fragmentation of star-forming clouds enriched with the first dust,"The thermal and fragmentation properties of star-forming clouds have
important consequences on the corresponding characteristic stellar mass. The
initial composition of the gas within these clouds is a record of the
nucleosynthetic products of previous stellar generations. In this paper we
present a model for the evolution of star-forming clouds enriched by metals and
dust from the first supernovae, resulting from the explosions of metal-free
progenitors with masses in the range 12 - 30 Msun and 140 - 260 Msun. Using a
self-consistent approach, we show that: (i) metals depleted onto dust grains
play a fundamental role, enabling fragmentation to solar or sub-solar mass
scales already at metallicities Zcr = 10^{-6} Zsun; (ii) even at metallicities
as high as 10^{-2} Zsun, metals diffused in the gas-phase lead to fragment mass
scales which are ~ 100 Msun; (iii) C atoms are strongly depleted onto amorphous
carbon grains and CO molecules so that CII plays a minor role in gas cooling,
leaving OI as the main gas-phase cooling agent in low-metallicity clouds. These
conclusions hold independently of the assumed supernova progenitors and suggest
that the onset of low-mass star formation is conditioned to the presence of
dust in the parent clouds.",2006-03-28T15:37:13Z
"Spitzer observations of the Orion OB1 association: second generation
  dust disks at 5-10 Myr","We report new Spitzer observations of intermediate mass stars in two regions
of the Orion OB1 association located in the subassociations OB1a ($\sim$10 Myr)
and OB1b ($\sim$5 Myr). In a representative sample of stars earlier than F5 of
both stellar groups, we find a population of stars surrounded of debris disks,
without excess in the IRAC bands and without emission lines in their optical
spectra, but with a varying degree of 24{\micron} excess. Comparing our samples
with 24{\micron} observations of intermediate mass stars in other stellar
groups, spanning a range of ages from 2.5 Myr to 150 Myr, we find that debris
disks are more frequent and have larger 24{\micron} excess at 10 Myr (OB1a).
This trend agrees with predictions of models of evolution of solids in the
outer regions of disks ($>$30 AU), where large icy objects ($\sim$1000 Km)
begin to form at $\sim$10 Myr; the presence of these objects in the disk
initiates a collisional cascade, producing enough dust particles to explain the
relatively large 24 {\micron} excess observed in OB1a. The dust luminosity
observed in the stellar groups older than 10 Myr declines roughly as predicted
by collisional cascade models. Combining Spitzer observations, optical spectra
and 2MASS data, we found a new Herbig Ae/Be star (HD290543) and a star
(HD36444) with a large 24 {\micron} excess, both in OB1b. This last object
could be explained as a intermediate stage between HAeBe and true debris
systems or as a massive debris disk produced by a collision between two large
objects ($>$1000 Km).",2006-07-25T14:21:24Z
"First Detection of NaI D lines in High-Redshift Damped Lyman-alpha
  Systems","A Near-infrared (1.18-1.35 micron) high-resolution spectrum of the
gravitationally-lensed QSO APM 08279+5255 was obtained with the IRCS mounted on
the Subaru Telescope using the AO system. We detected strong NaI D 5891,5897
doublet absorption in high-redshift DLAs at z=1.062 and 1.181, confirming the
presence of NaI, which was first reported for the rest-frame UV NaI
3303.3,3303.9 doublet by Petitjean et al. This is the first detection of NaI D
absorption in a high-redshift (z>1) DLA. In addition, we detected a new NaI
component in the z=1.062 DLA and four new components in the z=1.181 DLA. Using
an empirical relationship between NaI and HI column density, we found that all
""components"" have large HI column density, so that each component is classified
as DLA absorption. We also detected strong NaI D absorption associated with a
MgII system at z=1.173. Because no other metal absorption lines were detected
in this system at the velocity of the NaI absorption in previously reported
optical spectra (observed 3.6 years ago), we interpret this NaI absorption
cloud probably appeared in the line of sight toward the QSO after the optical
observation. This newly found cloud is likely to be a DLA based upon its large
estimated HI column density. We found that the N(NaI)/N(CaII) ratios in these
DLAs are systematically smaller than those observed in the Galaxy; they are
more consistent with the ratios seen in the Large Magellanic Cloud. This is
consistent with dust depletion generally being smaller in lower metallicity
environments. However, all five clouds of the z=1.181 system have a high
N(NaI)/N(CaII) ratio, which is characteristic of cold dense gas. We tentatively
suggest that the host galaxy of this system may be the most significant
contributor to the gravitational-lens toward APM 08279+5255.",2006-03-12T17:52:17Z
"The production of short-lived radionuclides by new non-rotating and
  rotating Wolf-Rayet model stars","It has been speculated that WR winds may have contaminated the forming solar
system, in particular with short-lived radionuclides (half-lives in the
approximate 10^5 - 10^8 y range) that are responsible for a class of isotopic
anomalies found in some meteoritic materials. We revisit the capability of the
WR winds to eject these radionuclides using new models of single non-exploding
WR stars with metallicity Z = 0.02. The earlier predictions for non-rotating WR
stars are updated, and models for rotating such stars are used for the first
time in this context. We find that (1) rotation has no significant influence on
the short-lived radionuclide production by neutron capture during the core
He-burning phase, and (2) 26Al, 36Cl, 41Ca, and 107Pd can be wind-ejected by a
variety of WR stars at relative levels that are compatible with the meteoritic
analyses for a period of free decay of around 10^5 y between production and
incorporation into the forming solar system solid bodies. We confirm the
previously published conclusions that the winds of WR stars have a radionuclide
composition that can meet the necessary condition for them to be a possible
contaminating agent of the forming solar system. Still, it remains to be
demonstrated from detailed models that this is a sufficient condition for these
winds to have provided a level of pollution that is compatible with the
observations.",2006-03-21T15:28:40Z
"Elastic or magnetic? A toy model for global magnetar oscillations with
  implications for QPOs during flares","We use a simple toy-model to discuss global MHD modes of a neutron star,
taking into account the magnetic coupling between the elastic crust and the
fluid core. Our results suggest that the notion of pure torsional crust modes
is not useful for the coupled system, all modes excite Alfven waves in the
core. However, we also show that the modes that are most likely to be excited
by a fractured crust, eg. during a magnetar flare, are such that the crust and
the core oscillate in concert. For our simple model, the frequencies of these
modes are similar to the ``pure crustal'' frequencies. In addition, our model
provides a natural explanation for the presence of lower frequency ($< 30$~Hz)

Composite Dark Matter and its Charged Constituents,"Stable charged heavy leptons and quarks can exist and hide in elusive atoms,
bound by Coulomb attraction and playing the role of dark matter. However, in
the expanding Universe it is not possible to recombine all the charged
particles into such atoms, and the positively charged particles, which escape
this recombination, bind with electrons in atoms of anomalous isotopes with
pregalactic abundance, exceeding substantially the terrestrial upper limits.
This abundance can not be reduced in the dense matter bodies, if negatively
charged particles have charge -1. Therefore composite dark matter can involve
only negatively charged particles with charge -2, while stable heavy particles
with charge -1 should be excluded. Realistic scenarios of composite dark
matter, avoiding this problem of anomalous isotope over-production, inevitably
predict the existence of primordial ""atoms"", in which primordial helium traps
all the free negatively charged heavy constituents with charge -2. Study of the
possibility for such primordial heavy $\alpha$ particle with compensated charge
to exist as well as the search for the stable charged constituents in cosmic
rays and accelerators provide crucial test for composite dark matter scenarios.",2006-04-25T10:27:16Z
On the viability of holistic cosmic-ray source models,"We consider the energy spectrum of cosmic-rays (CRs) from a purely
phenomenological point of view and investigate the possibility that they all be
produced by the same type of sources with a single power-law spectrum, in
E^{-x}, from thermal to ultra-high energies. We show that the relative fluxes
of the Galactic (GCR) and extra-galactic (EGCR) components are compatible with
such a holistic model, provided that the index of the source spectrum be x
\simeq 2.23\pm 0.07. This is compatible with the best-fit indices for both GCRs
and EGCRs, assuming that their source composition is the same, which is indeed
the case in a holistic model. It is also compatible with theoretical
expectations for particle acceleration at relativistic shocks.",2006-05-01T23:06:41Z
"A Simple Two-Parameter Characterization of Gamma-Ray Burst Time
  Histories","A simple scheme delineates Long GRBs with similar time histories using the
Internal Luminosity Function power-law index and the spectral lag. Several
generalizations are made about time history morphologies: 1) GRBs with long
spectral lags contain fewer pulses that are broader than those found in bursts
with short spectral lags, 2) short-lag bursts with small ILF power-law indices
have many narrow pulses and are highly variable, while long-lag bursts with
small ILF power-law indices are characterized by broad, smooth pulses and have
low variability.
  GRB time history morphologies primarily identify intrinsic rather than
extrinsic characteristics based on correlations with gamma-ray luminosity,
afterglow luminosity, and numbers of pulses. These characteristics result
because internal relativistic effects due to bulk Lorentz factor are larger
than cosmological effects, and because the numbers and shapes of pulses
indicate different efficiencies and forms of GRB energy release.
  Single-pulsed GRBs are characterized either by large ILF power indices
(indicating a range of jet opening angles and Lorentz factors, with a FRED
pulse shape), or they have long lags (large jet opening angles with low Lorentz
factors, with either a FRED pulse shape or an unpeaked, smooth pulse shape).
They also have lower-luminosity afterglows than multi-pulsed GRBs. GRBs with
simple time histories are often associated with Type Ibc supernovae. This
suggests that some single-pulsed GRBs contain single, beamed blast waves that
are similar to and have characteristics that overlap with those of many
supernovae. Such a connection may not exist between multi-pulsed GRBs and
supernovae.",2006-04-06T21:18:35Z
"Challenges in Detecting Gamma-Rays From Dark Matter Annihilations in the
  Galactic Center","Atmospheric Cerenkov Telescopes, including HESS and MAGIC, have detected a
spectrum of gamma-rays from the galactic center region which extends from
$\sim$200 GeV or lower, to at least $\sim$10 TeV. Although the source of this
radiation is not yet known, the spectrum appears to behave as a simple
power-law, which is not the expectation for gamma-rays generated through the
annihilation of dark matter particles. If instead we conclude that the source
of these gamma-rays is astrophysical in origin, this spectrum will constitute a
background for future dark matter searches using gamma-rays from this region.
In this paper we study how this background will affect the prospects for
experiments such as GLAST to detect dark matter in the galactic center. We find
that only a narrow range of dark matter annihilation rates are potentially
observable by GLAST given this newly discovered background and considering
current constraints from EGRET and HESS. We also find that a detection of line
emission, while not completely ruled out, is only possible for a very narrow
range of dark matter models and halo profiles.",2006-03-20T20:02:51Z
Cosmological Neutrino Entanglement and Quantum Pressure,"Context: The widespread view that cosmological neutrinos, even if massive,
are well described since the decoupling redshift z~10^10 down to the present
epoch by an almost perfectly collisionless fluid of classical point particles
is re-examined. Aims: In view of the likely sub-eV rest mass of neutrinos, the
main effects due to their fermionic nature are studied. Methods: By numerical
means we calculate the accurate entropy, fugacity and pressure of cosmological
neutrinos in the Universe expansion. By solving the Schroedinger equation we
derive how and how fast semi-degenerate identical free fermions become
entangled. Results: We find that for sub-eV neutrinos the exchange degeneracy
has significantly increased during the relativistic to non-relativistic
transition epoch at z~10^4-10^5. At all times neutrinos become entangled in
less than 10^-6 s, much faster than any plausible decoherence time. The total
pressure is increased by quantum effect from 5% at high redshifts to 68% at low
redshifts with respect to a collisionless classical fluid. Conclusions: The
quantum overpressure has no dynamical consequences in the homogeneous regime at
high redshifts, but must be significant for neutrino clustering during the
non-linear structure formation epoch at low redshifts.",2006-05-15T10:19:31Z
A Toy Model for Magnetic Connection in Black-Hole Accretion Disc,"A toy model for magnetic connection in black hole (BH) accretion disc is
discussed based on a poloidal magnetic field generated by a single electric
current flowing around a Kerr black hole in the equatorial plane. We discuss
the effects of the coexistence of two kinds of magnetic connection (MC) arising
respectively from (1) the closed field lines connecting the BH horizon with the
disc (henceforth MCHD), and (2) the closed field lines connecting the plunging
region with the disc (henceforth MCPD). The magnetic field configuration is
constrained by conservation of magnetic flux and a criterion of the screw
instability of the magnetic field. Two parameters and are introduced to
describe our model instead of resolving the complicated MHD equations. Compared
with MCHD, energy and angular momentum of the plunging particles are extracted
via MCPD more effectively, provided that the BH spin is not very high. It turns
out that negative energy can be delivered to the BH by the plunging particles
without violating the second law of BH thermodynamics, however it cannot be
realized via MCPD in a stable way.",2006-03-13T09:10:27Z
Spitzer Observations of High Redshift Radio Galaxies,"We present the results of a comprehensive Spitzer survey of 70 radio galaxies
across 1<z<5.2. Using IRAC, IRS and MIPS imaging we determine the rest-frame
AGN contribution to the stellar emission peak at 1.6um. The stellar
luminosities are found to be consistent with that of a giant elliptical with a
stellar mass of 10^11-12Msun. The mean stellar mass remains constant at
\~10^11.5Msun up to z=3 indicating that the upper end of the mass function is
already in place by this redshift. The mid-IR luminosities imply bolometric IR
luminosities that would classify all sources as ULIRGs. The mid-IR to radio
luminosity generally correlate implying a common origin for these emissions.
The ratio is higher than that found for lower redshift, ie z<1, radio galaxies.",2006-04-11T02:37:34Z
RHESSI Results -- Time For a Rethink?,"Hard X-rays and gamma-rays are the most direct signatures of energetic
electrons and ions in the sun's atmosphere which is optically thin at these
energies and their radiation involves no coherent processes. Being collisional
they are complementary to gyro-radiation in probing atmospheric density as
opposed to magnetic field and the electrons are primarily 10--100 keV in
energy, complementing the (>100 keV) electrons likely responsible for microwave
bursts.
  The pioneering results of the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager
(RHESSI) are raising the first new major questions concerning solar energetic
particles in many years. Some highlights of these results are discussed --
primarily around RHESSI topics on which the authors have had direct research
involvement -- particularly when they are raising the need for re-thinking of
entrenched ideas. Results and issues are broadly divided into discoveries in
the spatial, temporal and spectral domains, with the main emphasis on flare
hard X-rays/fast electrons but touching also on gamma-rays/ions, non-flare
emissions, and the relationship to radio bursts.",2006-07-19T10:59:21Z
"Suzaku Reveals Helium-burning Products in the X-ray Emitting Planetary
  Nebula BD+303639","BD+303639, the brightest planetary nebula at X-ray energies, was observed
with Suzaku, an X-ray observatory launched on 2005 July 10. Using the X-ray
Imaging Spectrometer, the K-lines from C VI, O VII, and O VIII were resolved
for the first time, and C/O, N/O, and Ne/O abundance ratios determined. The C/O
and Ne/O abundance ratios exceed the solar value by a factor of at least 30 and
5, respectively. These results indicate that the X-rays are emitted mainly by
helium shell-burning products.",2006-07-07T17:17:07Z
The stellar halo and outer disk of M33,"We present first results from a Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopic survey of red giant
branch (RGB) stars in M33. The radial velocity distributions of the stars in
our fields are well described by three Gaussian components, corresponding to a
candidate halo component with an uncorrected radial velocity dispersion of
sigma ~ 50km/s, a candidate disk component with a dispersion sigma ~ 16km/s,
and a third component offset from the disk by ~ 50km/s, but for which the
dispersion is not well constrained. By comparing our data to a model of M33
based upon its HI rotation curve, we find that the stellar disk is offset in
velocity by ~ 25km/s from the HI disk, consistent with the warping which exists
between these components. The spectroscopic metallicity of the halo component
is [Fe/H] ~ -1.5, significantly more metal-poor than the implied metallicity of
the disk population ([Fe/H] ~ -0.9), which also has a broader colour dispersion
than the halo population. These data represent the first detections of
individual stars in the halo of M33 and, despite being ~ 10 times less massive
than M31 or the Milky Way, all three of these disk galaxies have stellar halo
components with a similar metallicity. The color distribution of the third
component is different to the disk and the halo, but is similar to that
expected for a single, coeval, stellar population, and could represent a
stellar stream. More observations are required to determine the true nature of
this intriguing third kinematic component in M33.",2006-06-29T16:09:30Z
"Mass segregation in rich LMC clusters from modelling of deep HST
  colour-magnitude diagrams","We used the deep colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of five rich LMC clusters
(NGC1805, 1818, 1831, 1868, and Hodge14) observed with HST/WFPC2 to derive
their present day mass function (PDMF) and its variation with position within
the cluster. The PDMF was parameterized as a power law in the available
main-sequence mass range of each cluster, typically 0.9 <~ m/M_sun <~ 2.5; its
slope was determined at different positions spanning from the very centre out
to several core radii. The CMDs in the central regions of the clusters were
carefully studied earlier, resulting in accurate age, metallicity, distance
modulus, and reddening values. The slope alpha (where Salpeter is 2.35) was
determined in annuli by following two distinct methods: 1) a power law fit to
the PDMF obtained from the systemic luminosity function (LF); 2) a statistical
comparison between observed and model CMDs. In all clusters, significant mass
segregation is found from the positional dependence of the PDMF slope: alpha <~
1.8 for R <= 1.0 R_core and alpha ~ Salpeter inside R=2~3 R_core (except for
Hodge 14, where alpha ~ Salpeter for R ~ 4 R_core). The results are robust in
the sense that they hold true for both methods used. The CMD method reveals
that unresolved binaries flatten the PDMF obtained form the systemic LF, but
this effect is smaller than the uncertainties in the alpha determination. For
each cluster we estimated dynamical ages inside the core and for the entire
system. In both cases we found a trend in the sense that older clusters have
flatter PDMF, consistent with a dynamical mass segregation and stellar
evaporation.",2006-04-28T19:35:45Z
"Radio Emission on Sub-Parsec Scales from the Intermediate-Mass Black
  Hole in NGC 4395","The Seyfert 1 nucleus of NGC 4395 is energized by a black hole of 360,000
Solar masses (Peterson et al.), making it one of only two nuclear black holes
of intermediate mass, one thousand to one million Solar masses, detected in the
radio regime. Building upon UV and X-ray evidence for outflows from this
Seyfert nucleus, the VLBI High Sensitivity Array was used at 1.4 GHz to search
for extended structure on scales greater than 5 mas (0.1 pc). Elongated
emission was discovered, extending over 15 mas (0.3 pc) and suggesting an
outflow on sub-parsec scales from this intermediate-mass black hole. The
Seyfert nucleus is located at the center of an elliptical star cluster, and the
elongation position angle of the sub-parsec radio structure is only 19 degrees
from the star cluster's minor axis.",2006-06-23T20:37:02Z
Comparing Dynamical and Stellar Population Mass-to-Light Ratio Estimates,"We investigate the mass-to-light ratios of stellar populations as predicted
by stellar population synthesis codes and compare those to
dynamical/gravitational measurements. In Bell & de Jong (2001) we showed that
population synthesis models predict a tight relation between the color and
mass-to-light ratio of a stellar population. The normalization of this relation
depends critically on the shape of the stellar IMF at the low-mass end. These
faint stars contribute significantly to the mass, but insignificantly to the
luminosity and color of a stellar system. In Bell & de Jong (2001) we used
rotation curves to normalize the relation, but rotation curves provide only an
upper limit to the stellar masses in a system. Here we compare stellar and
dynamical masses for a range of stellar systems in order to constrain the mass
normalization of stellar population models. We find that the normalization of
Bell & de Jong (2001) should be lowered by about 0.05-0.1 dex in M/L. This is
consistent with a Kroupa (2001), Chabrier (2003) or a Kennicutt (1983) IMF, but
does not leave much room for other unseen components.",2006-04-19T13:08:48Z
Linear radio structures in selected Seyfert and LINER galaxies,"High resolution MERLIN 5 GHz observations (0.04"") of 7 Seyfert galaxies,
selected as the ones previously showing evidence of collimated ejection, have
been compared with high resolution archive HST data. The radio maps reveal rich
structures in all the galaxies. NGC 2639 and TXFS 2226-184 have multiple knot
parsec-scale extended structures, Mrk 1034, Mrk 1210, NGC 4922C and NGC 5506
reveal one-sided jets, while IC 1481 exhibits a jet-like extension. The close
correlation between the radio-emitting relativistic plasma and the ionized gas
in the inner regions of these galaxies allows us to study in detail the physics
close to the center of low luminosity AGN.",2006-03-20T23:49:47Z

"Robust Machine Learning Applied to Astronomical Datasets I: Star-Galaxy
  Classification of the SDSS DR3 Using Decision Trees","We provide classifications for all 143 million non-repeat photometric objects
in the Third Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) using decision
trees trained on 477,068 objects with SDSS spectroscopic data. We demonstrate
that these star/galaxy classifications are expected to be reliable for
approximately 22 million objects with r < ~20. The general machine learning
environment Data-to-Knowledge and supercomputing resources enabled extensive
investigation of the decision tree parameter space. This work presents the
first public release of objects classified in this way for an entire SDSS data
release. The objects are classified as either galaxy, star or nsng (neither
star nor galaxy), with an associated probability for each class. To demonstrate
how to effectively make use of these classifications, we perform several
important tests. First, we detail selection criteria within the probability
space defined by the three classes to extract samples of stars and galaxies to
a given completeness and efficiency. Second, we investigate the efficacy of the
classifications and the effect of extrapolating from the spectroscopic regime
by performing blind tests on objects in the SDSS, 2dF Galaxy Redshift and 2dF
QSO Redshift (2QZ) surveys. Given the photometric limits of our spectroscopic
training data, we effectively begin to extrapolate past our star-galaxy
training set at r ~ 18. By comparing the number counts of our training sample
with the classified sources, however, we find that our efficiencies appear to
remain robust to r ~ 20. As a result, we expect our classifications to be
accurate for 900,000 galaxies and 6.7 million stars, and remain robust via
extrapolation for a total of 8.0 million galaxies and 13.9 million stars.

"Molecular Line Observations of Infrared Dark Clouds: Seeking the
  Precursors to Intermediate and Massive Star Formation","We have identified 41 infrared dark clouds from the 8 micron maps of the
Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX), selected to be found within one square degree
areas centered on known ultracompact HII regions. We have mapped these infrared
dark clouds in N2H+(1-0), CS(2-1) and C18O(1-0) emission using the Five College
Radio Astronomy Observatory. The maps of the different species often show
striking differences in morphologies, indicating differences in evolutionary
state and/or the presence of undetected, deeply embedded protostars. We derive
an average mass for these clouds using N2H+ column densities of ~2500 solar
masses, a value comparable to that found in previous studies of high mass star
forming cores using other mass tracers. The linewidths of these clouds are
typically ~2.0 - 2.9 km/s. Based on the fact that they are dark at 8 micron,
compact, massive, and have large velocity dispersions, we suggest that these
clouds may be the precursor sites of intermediate and high mass star formation.",2006-06-12T23:34:11Z
New algorithms for adaptive optics point-spread function reconstruction,"Context. The knowledge of the point-spread function compensated by adaptive
optics is of prime importance in several image restoration techniques such as
deconvolution and astrometric/photometric algorithms. Wavefront-related data
from the adaptive optics real-time computer can be used to accurately estimate
the point-spread function in adaptive optics observations. The only
point-spread function reconstruction algorithm implemented on astronomical
adaptive optics system makes use of particular functions, named $U\_{ij}$.
These $U\_{ij}$ functions are derived from the mirror modes, and their number
is proportional to the square number of these mirror modes. Aims. We present
here two new algorithms for point-spread function reconstruction that aim at
suppressing the use of these $U\_{ij}$ functions to avoid the storage of a
large amount of data and to shorten the computation time of this PSF
reconstruction. Methods. Both algorithms take advantage of the eigen
decomposition of the residual parallel phase covariance matrix. In the first
algorithm, the use of a basis in which the latter matrix is diagonal reduces
the number of $U\_{ij}$ functions to the number of mirror modes. In the second
algorithm, this eigen decomposition is used to compute phase screens that
follow the same statistics as the residual parallel phase covariance matrix,
and thus suppress the need for these $U\_{ij}$ functions. Results. Our
algorithms dramatically reduce the number of $U\_{ij}$ functions to be computed
for the point-spread function reconstruction. Adaptive optics simulations show
the good accuracy of both algorithms to reconstruct the point-spread function.",2006-06-28T09:44:48Z
Hamilton's Eccentricity Vector Generalised to Newton Wonders,"The vectorial velocity is given as a function of the position of a particle
in orbit when a Newtonian central force is supplemented by an inverse cubic
force as in Newton's theorem on revolving orbits. Such expressions are useful
in fitting orbits to radial velocities of orbital streams. The
Hamilton-Laplace-Runge-Lenz eccentricity vector is generalised to give a
constant of the motion for these systems and an approximate constant for orbits
in general central potentials. A related vector is found for Hooke's centred
ellipse.",2006-04-20T14:10:44Z
"Old open clusters as key tracers of Galactic chemical evolution. I. Fe
  abundances in NGC 2660, NGC 3960, and Berkeley 32","We obtained high-resolution UVES/FLAMES observations of a sample of nine old
open clusters spanning a wide range of ages and Galactocentric radii. The goal
of the project is to investigate the radial metallicity gradient in the disk,
as well as the abundance of key elements (alpha and Fe-peak elements). In this
paper we present the results for the metallicity of three clusters: NGC 2660
(age ~1 Gyr, Galactocentric distance of 8.68 kpc), NGC 3960 (~ 1 Gyr, 7.80
kpc), and Be 32 (~6-7 Gyr, 11.30 kpc). For Be 32 and NGC 2660, our study
provides the first metallicity determination based on high-resolution spectra.
We performed equivalent width analysis with the spectral code MOOG, which
allows us to define a metallicity scale and build a homogeneous sample. We find
that NGC 3960 and NGC 2660 have a metallicity that is very close to solar
([Fe/H]=+0.02 and +0.04, respectively), while the older Be 32 turns out to have
[Fe/H]=$-$0.29.",2006-07-19T09:51:33Z
Equilibrium Star Cluster Formation,"We argue that rich star clusters take at least several local dynamical times
to form, and so are quasi-equilibrium structures during their assembly.
Observations supporting this conclusion include morphologies of star-forming
clumps, momentum flux of protostellar outflows from forming clusters, age
spreads of stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) and other clusters, and the
age of a dynamical ejection event from the ONC. We show that these long
formation timescales are consistent with the expected star formation rate in
turbulent gas, as recently evaluated by Krumholz & McKee. Finally, we discuss
the implications of these timescales for star formation efficiencies, the
disruption of gas by stellar feedback, mass segregation of stars, and the
longevity of turbulence in molecular clumps.",2006-03-10T22:52:43Z
"V4745 Sgr -- a nova above the period gap and an intermediate polar
  candidate","A period analysis of CCD unfiltered photometry of V4745 Sgr (Nova Sgr 2003
#1) performed during 23 nights in the years 2003 - 2005 is presented. The
photometric data are modulated with a period of 0.20782 +- 0.00003 d ($4.98768
+- 0.00072 h). Following the shape of the phased light curve and the presence
of the periodicity in all data sets with no apparent change in its value, we
interpret this periodicity as orbital in nature and this is consistent with a
cataclysmic variable above the period gap. We found a probable short-term
periodicity of 0.017238 +- 0.000037 d (24.82272 +- 0.05328 m) which we
interpret as the probable spin period of the white dwarf or the beat period
between the orbital and spin period. Therefore, we propose that nova V4745 Sgr
should be classified as an intermediate polar candidate, supporting the
proposed link between transition-oscillation novae and intermediate polars. The
mass-period relation for cataclysmic variables yields a secondary mass of about
0.52 +- 0.05 M_solar.",2006-05-22T10:23:36Z
SN 2006aj and the nature of low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts,"We present SMARTS consortium optical/IR light curves of SN 2006aj associated
with GRB 060218. We find that this event is broadly similar to two previously
observed events SN 1998bw/GRB 980425 and SN 2003lw/GRB 031203. In particular,
all of these events are greatly under-luminous in gamma-rays compared to
typical long-duration GRBs. We find that the observation by Swift of even one
such event implies a large enough true event rate to create difficulties in
interpreting these events as typical GRBs observed off-axis. Thus these events
appear to be intrinsically different from and much more common than
high-luminosity GRBs, which have been observed in large numbers out to a
redshift of at least 6.3. The existence of a range of intrinsic energies of
GRBs may present challenges to using GRBs as standard candles.",2006-03-30T20:59:13Z
"Anisotropic Thermal Conduction in Supernova Remnants: Relevance to Hot
  Gas Filling Factors in the Magnetized ISM","We explore the importance of anisotropic thermal conduction in the evolution
of supernova remnants via numerical simulations. The mean temperature of the
bubble of hot gas is decreased by a factor of ~3 compared to simulations
without thermal conduction, together with an increase in the mean density of
hot gas by a similar factor. Thus, thermal conduction greatly reduces the
volume of hot gas produced over the life of the remnant. This underscores the
importance of thermal conduction in estimating the hot gas filling fraction and
emissivities in high-stage ions in Galactic and proto-galactic ISMs.",2006-04-05T23:16:46Z
The HII Region of a Primordial Star,"The concordance model of cosmology and structure formation predicts the
formation of isolated very massive stars at high redshifts in dark matter
dominated halos of 10^5 to 10^6 Msun. These stars photo-ionize their host
primordial molecular clouds, expelling all the baryons from their halos. When
the stars die, a relic HII region is formed within which large amounts of
molecular hydrogen form which will allow the gas to cool efficiently when
gravity assembles it into larger dark matter halos. The filaments surrounding
the first star hosting halo are largely shielded and provide the pathway for
gas to stream into the halo when the star has died. We present the first fully
three dimensional cosmological radiation hydrodynamical simulations that follow
all these effects. A novel adaptive ray casting technique incorporates the time
dependent radiative transfer around point sources. This approach is fast enough
so that radiation transport, kinetic rate equations, and hydrodynamics are
solved self-consistently. It retains the time derivative of the transfer
equation and is explicitly photon conserving. This method is integrated with
the cosmological adaptive mesh refinement code enzo, and runs on distributed
and shared memory parallel architectures. Where applicable the three
dimensional calculation not only confirm expectations from earlier one
dimensional results but also illustrate the multi-fold hydrodynamic
complexities of HII regions. In the absence of stellar winds the circumstellar
environments of the first supernovae and putative early gamma-ray bursts will
be of low density ~1 cm^-3. Albeit marginally resolved, ionization front
instabilities lead to cometary and elephant trunk like small scale structures
reminiscent of nearby star forming regions.",2006-06-01T05:47:59Z
Nonlinear Development of Thermal Instability without External Forcing,"Supersonic turbulent motions are the remarkable properties of interstellar
medium. Previous numerical simulations have demonstrated that the thermal
instability in a shock-compressed layer produces the supersonic turbulent
motion that does not decay. In this paper we focus on two- and
three-dimensional numerical simulations of the non-linear development of simple
thermal instability incorporating physical viscosity but without any external
forcing, in order to isolate the effects of various processes responsible for
the long-lasting turbulent motion. As the initial condition for our
simulations, we set up spatially uniform gas with thermally unstable
temperature in a box with periodic boundaries. After the linear growth stage of
the thermal instability, two-phase medium forms where cold clumps are embedded
in warm medium, and turbulent fluid flow clearly visible as translational
motions of the cold clumps does not decay in a viscous dissipation timescale.
The amplitude of the turbulent velocity increases when we reduce the Prandtl
number that is the non-dimensional ratio of kinetic viscosity to thermal
conduction: the saturation amplitude does not change when we increase the
viscosity and thermal conduction coefficients simultaneously in order to keep
the Prandtl number. This shows that the thermal conduction plays an important
role in maintaining turbulent motions against viscous dissipation. The
amplitude also increases when we increase the ratio of the computational domain
length $L$ to the cooling length $\lambda_{\rm c}$ that is defined by the
product of the cooling time and the sound speed, as long as $L \la 100
\lambda_{\rm c}$.",2006-05-20T12:15:46Z
Information content in the halo-model dark-matter power spectrum,"Using the halo model, we investigate the cosmological Fisher information in
the non-linear dark-matter power spectrum about the initial amplitude of linear
power. We find that there is little information on `translinear' scales (where
the one- and two-halo terms are both significant) beyond what is on linear
scales, but that additional information is present on small scales, where the
one-halo term dominates. This behavior agrees with the surprising results that
Rimes & Hamilton (2005, 2006) found using N-body simulations. We argue that the
translinear plateau in cumulative information arises largely from fluctuations
in the numbers of large haloes in a finite volume. This implies that more
information could be extracted on non-linear scales if the masses of the
largest haloes in a survey are known.",2006-04-13T02:36:50Z
Transients from Initial Conditions in Cosmological Simulations,"We study the impact of setting initial conditions in numerical simulations
using the standard procedure based on the Zel'dovich approximation (ZA). As it
is well known from perturbation theory, ZA initial conditions have incorrect
second and higher-order growth and therefore excite long-lived transients in
the evolution of the statistical properties of density and velocity fields. We
also study the improvement brought by using more accurate initial conditions
based on second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT). We show that 2LPT
initial conditions reduce transients significantly and thus are much more
appropriate for numerical simulations devoted to precision cosmology. Using
controlled numerical experiments with ZA and 2LPT initial conditions we show
that simulations started at redshift z_i=49 using the ZA underestimate the
power spectrum in the nonlinear regime by about 2,4,8 % at z=0,1,3
respectively, whereas the mass function of dark matter halos is underestimated
by 5% at m=10^15 M_sun/h (z=0) and 10% at m=2x10^14M_sun/h (z=1). The
clustering of halos is also affected to the few percent level at z=0. These
systematics effects are typically larger than statistical uncertainties in
recent mass function and power spectrum fitting formulae extracted from
numerical simulations. At large scales, the measured transients in higher-order
correlations can be understood from first principle calculations based on
perturbation theory.",2006-06-21T12:36:29Z
"X-ray thermal coronae of galaxies in hot clusters -- ubiquity of
  embedded mini cooling cores","We present a systematic investigation of X-ray thermal coronae in 157
early-type galaxies and 22 late-type galaxies from a survey of 25 hot (kT>3
keV), nearby (z<0.05) clusters, based on CHANDRA archival data. Cool galactic
coronae (kT=0.5-1.1 keV generally) have been found to be very common, >60% in
NIR selected galaxies that are more luminous than 2L*, and >40% in L* < L_Ks <
2L* galaxies. These embedded coronae in hot clusters are generally smaller
(1.5-4 kpc radii), less luminous (<~ 10^41 erg s^-1), and less massive
(10^6.5-10^8 M_solar}) than coronae in poor environments, demonstrating the
negative effects of hot cluster environments on galactic coronae. Nevertheless,
these coronae still manage to survive ICM stripping, evaporation, rapid
cooling, and powerful AGN outflows, making them a rich source of information
about gas stripping, microscopic transport, and feedback processes in the
cluster environment. Heat conduction across the boundary of the coronae has to
be suppressed by a factor of >100, which implies the X-ray gas in early-type
galaxies is magnetized and the magnetic field plays an important role in energy
transfer. Stripping through transport processes (viscosity or turbulence) also
needs to be suppressed by at least a factor of ten at the coronal boundary...
(abridged) Diffuse thermal coronae have also been detected in at least 8 of 22
late-type (Sb or later) galaxies in our sample. Evidence for enhanced star
formation triggered by the ICM pressure has been found in four late-type
galaxies. The fraction of luminous X-ray AGN (>10^41 ergs s^-1) is not small (~
5%) in our sample.",2006-06-08T03:49:57Z
"High Mass Star Formation. II. The Mass Function of Submillimeter Clumps
  in M17","We have mapped an approximately 5.5 by 5.5 pc portion of the M17 massive
star-forming region in both 850 and 450 micron dust continuum emission using
the Submillimeter Common-User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) on the James Clerk
Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). The maps reveal more than 100 dusty clumps with
deconvolved linear sizes of 0.05--0.2 pc and masses of 0.8--120 solar masses,
most of which are not associated with known mid-infrared point sources. Fitting
the clump mass function with a double power law gives a mean power law exponent
of alpha_high = -2.4 +/- 0.3 for the high-mass power law, consistent with the
exponent of the Salpeter stellar mass function. We show that a lognormal clump
mass distribution with a peak at about 4 solar masses produces as good a fit to
the clump mass function as does a double power law. This 4 solar mass peak mass
is well above the peak masses of both the stellar initial mass function and the
mass function of clumps in low-mass star-forming regions. Despite the
difference in intrinsic mass scale, the shape of the M17 clump mass function
appears to be consistent with the shape of the core mass function in low-mass
star-forming regions. Thus, we suggest that the clump mass function in
high-mass star-forming regions may be a scaled-up version of that in low-mass
regions, instead of its extension to higher masses.",2006-03-13T23:39:51Z
A New Look at the Binary Characteristics of Massive Stars,"We constrain the properties of massive binaries by comparing radial velocity
data of Cygnus OB2 with Monte Carlo models. Our comparisons test several
popular prescriptions for massive binary parameters. We explore a range of true
binary fraction, F, a range of power-law slopes, \alpha, describing the
distribution of companion masses, and a range of power-law slopes, \beta,
describing the distribution of orbital separations. We also consider
distributions of secondary masses described by a Miller-Scalo type initial mass
function and by a two-component IMF that includes a substantial ``twin''
population with M_2 ~ M_1. We show that binary fractions F<0.7 are considerably
less probable than F>0.8. Thus, the true binary fraction is high. For F=1.0 and
a distribution of orbital separations near the canonical Opik's Law
distribution (i.e., flat; \beta=0), the power law slope of the mass ratio
distribution is \alpha= -0.6 - 0.0. For F~0.8, \alpha is somewhat larger, in
the range -0.4 - 1.0. In any case, the secondary star mass function is
inconsistent with a Miller-Scalo -like IMF unless the lower end is truncated
below ~ 2--4 solar masses. In other words, massive stars preferentially have
massive companions. The best fitting models are described by a Salpeter or
Miller-Scalo IMF for 60% of secondary star masses with the other 40% of
secondaries having M_2 ~ M_1, i.e., ``twins''. These best-fitting model
parameters simultaneously predict the fraction of type Ib/c supernovae to be
30-40% of all core-collapse supernovae, in agreement with recent observational
estimates.",2006-05-02T19:39:04Z
"Impact of Stellar Dynamics on the Frequency of Giant Planets in Close
  Binaries","Hostile tidal forces may inhibit the formation of Jovian planets in binaries
with semimajor axes of $\la$$50\au$, binaries that might be called ``close'' in
this context. As an alternative to in situ planet formation, a binary can
acquire a giant planet when one of its original members is replaced in a
dynamical interaction with another star that hosts a planet. Simple scaling
relations for the structure and evolution of star clusters, coupled with
analytic arguments regarding binary-single and binary-binary scattering,
indicate that dynamical processes can deposit Jovian planets in $<$1% of close
binaries. If ongoing and future exoplanet surveys measure a much larger
fraction, it may be that giant planets do somehow form frequently in such
systems.",2006-06-27T04:59:42Z
On the Orbits and Masses of the Satellites of the Pluto-Charon System,"(Abridged) The orbits of the recently discovered satellites of Pluto, S/2005
P2 and S/2005 P1, are significantly non-Keplerian, even if P2 and P1 have
negligible masses, because the mass ratio of Charon-Pluto is ~0.1. We present
an analytic theory with P2 and P1 treated as test particles. This analytic
theory shows that the azimuthal periods of P2 and P1 are shorter than the
Keplerian orbital periods and that the periapse and ascending node of each of
the satellites precess at nearly equal rates in opposite directions. The
deviation from Kepler's third law is already detected in the unperturbed
Keplerian fit of Buie and coworkers. We also present direct numerical orbit
integrations with different assumed masses for P2 and P1 within the ranges
allowed by the albedo uncertainties. If the albedos are as high as that of
Charon, the masses of P2 and P1 are sufficiently low that their orbits are well
described by the analytic theory. There is at present no evidence that P2 has
any significant epicyclic eccentricity. However, the orbit of P1 has a
significant epicyclic eccentricity, and its prograde periapse precession with a
period of 5300 days should be easily detectable. If the albedos are as low as
that of comets, the large inferred masses induce significant variations in the
epicyclic eccentricities and/or periapse longitudes on the 400-500-day
timescales, due to the proximity of P2 and P1 to the 3:2 mean-motion
commensurability. In fact, for the maximum inferred masses, P2 and P1 may be in
the 3:2 mean-motion resonance, with the resonance variable involving the

"The GRB 060218/SN 2006aj event in the context of other Gamma-Ray Burst
  Supernovae","The supernova SN 2006aj associated with GRB 060218 is the second-closest
GRB-SN observed to date (z=0.033). We present Very Large Telescope, Liverpool
Telescope, and Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope multi-color photometry of SN
2006aj. This supernova is found to be subluminous and rapidly evolving. Its
early light curve includes an additional wavelength-dependent component, which
can be interpreted as shock break-out. We compare the photometric evolution of
multi-band light curves with the corresponding properties of the present sample
of more than 10 GRB-SNe with precisely known redshifts. Using host-galaxy
extinction measurements, we derive extinction-corrected GRB-SN luminosities and
place SN 2006aj in the context of this GRB-selected supernova sample as well as
in the context of local stripped-envelope supernovae.",2006-05-02T15:45:45Z
The lack of binaries among hot horizontal branch stars: M80 and NGC5986,"We present preliminary results of a our search for close (period P < 10 days)
binary systems among hot (Teff > 20000 K) horizontal branch stars in globular
clusters M80 and NGC5986. We measured radial velocity variations of 11 targets
in M80 and 5 in NGC5986, spectroscopically observed at medium resolution
(R=4100) during four nights at VLT-FORS2. We found one close binary candidate
in M80, showing statistically significative radial velocity variations, and no
clear evidence in NGC5986. These results confirm the lack of close binaries
among hot horizontal branch stars in globular clusters, as already found in
NGC6752, at variance with what observed among hot subdwarfs in the field.",2006-06-01T20:10:56Z
"Anisotropic Galactic Outflows and Enrichment of the Intergalactic
  Medium. I: Monte Carlo Simulations","We have developed an analytical model to describe the evolution of
anisotropic galactic outflows. With it, we investigate the impact of varying
opening angle on galaxy formation and the evolution of the IGM. We have
implemented this model in a Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate galaxy formation
and outflows in a cosmological context. Using this algorithm, we have simulated
the evolution of a comoving volume of size [12h^(-1)Mpc]^3 in the LCDM
universe. Starting from a Gaussian density field at redshift z=24, we follow
the formation of ~20,000 galaxies, and simulate the galactic outflows produced
by these galaxies. When these outflows collide with density peaks, ram pressure
stripping of the gas inside the peak may result. This occurs in around half the
cases and prevents the formation of galaxies. Anisotropic outflows follow the
path of least resistance, and thus travel preferentially into low-density
regions, away from cosmological structures (filaments and pancakes) where
galaxies form. As a result, the number of collisions is reduced, leading to the
formation of a larger number of galaxies. Anisotropic outflows can
significantly enrich low-density systems with metals. Conversely, the
cross-pollution in metals of objects located in a common cosmological
structure, like a filament, is significantly reduced. Highly anisotropic
outflows can travel across cosmological voids and deposit metals in other,
unrelated cosmological structures.",2006-06-17T15:42:41Z
"Inflation after WMAP3: Confronting the Slow-Roll and Exact Power Spectra
  with CMB Data","The implications of the WMAP (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe) third
year data for inflation are investigated using both the slow-roll approximation
and an exact numerical integration of the inflationary power spectra including
a phenomenological modelling of the reheating era. At slow-roll leading order,
the constraints epsilon_1 < 0.022 and -0.07 < epsilon_2 < 0.07 are obtained at
95% CL (Confidence Level) implying a tensor-to-scalar ratio r_10 < 0.21 and a
Hubble parameter during inflation H/Mpl < 1.3 x 10^(-5). At next-to-leading
order, a tendency for epsilon_3 > 0 is observed. With regards to the exact
numerical integration, large field models, V(phi) proportional to phi^p, with p
> 3.1 are now excluded at 95% CL. Small field models, V(phi) proportional to
1-(phi/mu)^p, are still compatible with the data for all values of p. However,
if mu/Mpl < 10 is assumed, then the case p = 2 is slightly disfavoured. In
addition, mild constraints on the reheating temperature for an extreme equation
of state w_reh = -1/3 are found, namely T_reh > 2 TeV at 95% CL. Hybrid models
are disfavoured by the data, the best fit model having Delta chi^2 = +5 with
two extra parameters in comparison with large field models. Running mass models
remain compatible, but no prior independent constraints can be obtained.
Finally, superimposed oscillations of trans-Planckian origin are studied. The
vanilla slow-roll model is still the most probable one. However, the overall
statistical weight in favour of superimposed oscillations has increased in
comparison with the WMAP first year data, the amplitude of the oscillations
satisfying 2|x|sigma_0 < 0.76 at 95% CL. The best fit model leads to an
improvement of Delta chi^2 = -12 for three extra parameters. Moreover, compared
to other oscillatory patterns, the logarithmic shape is favoured.",2006-05-15T17:58:41Z
Deep and wide field imaging of the Coma cluster: the data,"We have obtained deep and wide field imaging of the Coma cluster of galaxies
with the CFH12K camera at CFHT in the B, V, R and I filters. In this paper, we
present the observations, data reduction, catalogs and first scientific
results.
  We investigated the quality of our data by internal and external literature
comparisons. We also checked the realisation of the observational requirements
we set.
  Our observations cover two partially overlapping areas of $42 \times 28$
arcmin$^2$, leading to a total area of 0.72 $\times$ 0.82 deg$^2$. We have
produced catalogs of objects that cover a range of more than 10 magnitudes and
are complete at the 90% level at B$\sim$25, V$\sim$24, R$\sim$24 and
I$\sim$23.5 for stellar-like objects, and at B$\sim$22, V$\sim$21, R$\sim$20.75
and I$\sim$20.5 for faint low-surface-brightness galaxy-like objects.
Magnitudes are in good agreement with published values from R$\sim$16 to
R$\sim$25. The photometric uncertainties are of the order of 0.1 magnitude at
R$\sim$20 and of 0.3 magnitude at R$\sim$25. Astrometry is accurate to
0.5~arcsec and also in good agreement with published data.
  Our catalog provides a rich dataset that can be mined for years to come to
gain new insights into the formation and evolution of the Coma cluster and its
galaxy population. As an illustration of the data quality, we examine the
bright part of the Colour Magnitude Relation (B-R versus R) derived from the
catalog and find that it is in excellent agreement with that derived for
galaxies with redshifts in the Coma cluster, and with previous CMRs estimated
in the literature.",2006-06-19T08:49:03Z
Nonlinear Diffusive Shock Acceleration with Magnetic Field Amplification,"We introduce a Monte Carlo model of nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration
allowing for the generation of large-amplitude magnetic turbulence. The model
is the first to include strong wave generation, efficient particle acceleration
to relativistic energies in nonrelativistic shocks, and thermal particle
injection in an internally self-consistent manner. We find that the upstream
magnetic field can be amplified by large factors and show that this
amplification depends strongly on the ambient Alfven Mach number. We also show
that in the nonlinear model large increases in the magnetic field do not
necessarily translate into a large increase in the maximum particle momentum a
particular shock can produce, a consequence of high momentum particles
diffusing in the shock precursor where the large amplified field converges to
the low ambient value. To deal with the field growth rate in the regime of
strong fluctuations, we extend to strong turbulence a parameterization that is
consistent with the resonant quasi-linear growth rate in the weak turbulence
limit. We believe our parameterization spans the maximum and minimum range of
the fluctuation growth and, within these limits, we show that the nonlinear
shock structure, acceleration efficiency, and thermal particle injection rates
depend strongly on the yet to be determined details of wave growth in strongly
turbulent fields. The most direct application of our results will be to
estimate magnetic fields amplified by strong cosmic-ray modified shocks in
supernova remnants.",2006-06-18T21:09:44Z
"Discovery of new Milky Way star cluster candidates in the 2MASS point
  source catalog. V. Follow-up observations of the young stellar cluster
  candidates RCW87, [BDSB2003]164 and [DBSB2003]172","Massive clusters are more often found in actively star forming galaxies than
in quiescent ones, similar to the Milky Way. We have carried out an extensive
survey of obscured Milky Way clusters to determine whether our Galaxy is still
forming such objects. Near-infrared spectral classification of some probable
cluster members was used to derive the distances to the cluster candidates.
Isochrone analysis of deep near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams allowed us to
obtain age and mass estimates. We report the physical parameters of three
cluster candidates:
  RCW87 is approx. 25 Myr old, located at a distance of D=7.6 Kpc in the
general direction of the Galactic center. Adding the mass of the suspected
cluster members we obtain an estimated total cluster mass of approx. 10300
solar masses. The mid-infrared photometry indicates that some next-generation
star formation is on-going in the associated HII region, probably triggered by
supernovae or stellar wind from the older stars in RCW87.
  The brightest member of [BDSB2003]164 is an O5V type star, based on our
spectroscopy. This limits the cluster age to less than a few million years. The
estimated total mass is approx. 1760 solar masses and the distance is D=3.2
Kpc.
  [DBSB2003]172 lacks central concentration and most likely this is not a
cluster but an extended star forming region.
  The high mass of RCW87 -- if confirmed -- puts this object in line with
Arches and Quintuplet, among the most young massive clusters in the Galaxy.
Further study is necessary to confirm this important result.",2006-05-20T00:07:01Z
Statistics of Giant Radio Halos from Electron Reacceleration Models,"The most important evidence of non-thermal phenomena in galaxy clusters comes
from Giant Radio Halos (GRHs), synchrotron radio sources extended over Mpc
scales, detected in a growing number of massive galaxy clusters. A promising
possibility to explain these sources is given by ""in situ"" stochastic
reacceleration of relativistic electrons by turbulence generated in the cluster
volume during merger events. Cassano & Brunetti (2005) have recently shown that
the expected fraction of clusters with GRHs and the increase of such a fraction
with cluster mass can be reconciled with present observations provided that a
fraction of 20-30 % of the turbulence in clusters is in the form of
compressible modes. In this work we extend these calculations by including a
scaling of the magnetic field strength with cluster mass. We show that the
observed correlations between the synchrotron radio power of a sample of 17
GRHs and the X-ray properties of the hosting clusters are consistent with, and
actually predicted by a magnetic field dependence on the virial mass of the
form B \propto M^b, with b>0.5 and typical micro Gauss strengths of the average
B intensity. The occurrence of GRHs as a function of both cluster mass and
redshift is obtained. The most relevant findings are that the predicted
luminosity functions of GRHs are peaked around a power P_{1.4 GHz} 10^{24}
W/Hz, and severely cut-off at low radio powers due to the decrease of the
electron reacceleration in smaller galaxy clusters. We expect a total number of
GRHs to be discovered at ~mJy radio fluxes of ~100 at 1.4 GHz. Finally, the
occurrence of GRHs and their number counts at 150 MHz are estimated in view of
the fortcoming operation of low frequency observatories (LOFAR, LWA) and
compared with those at higher radio frequencies.",2006-04-05T16:45:08Z
"X-ray and IR Point Source Identification and Characteristics In the
  Embedded, Massive Star-Forming Region RCW 38","We report on results of a 96.7 ks Chandra observation of one of the youngest,
most embedded and massive young stellar clusters studied in X-rays - RCW 38. We
detect 460 sources in the field of which 360 are confirmed to be associated
with the RCW~38 cluster. The cluster members range in luminosity from ~10^30
ergs s^-1 to 10^33.5 ergs s^-1. Over ten percent of the cluster members with
over 100 counts exhibit flares while about 15% of cluster members with over 30
counts are variable. Of the sources identified as cluster members, 160 have
near-infrared (NIR) counterparts either in the 2MASS database or detected via
VLT observations. Of these about 20% appear to have optically thick disks. An
additional 353 members are identified through NIR observations of which at
least 50% possess optically thick disks. We fit over 100 X-ray sources as
absorbed Raymond-Smith type plasmas and find the column to the cluster members
varies from 10^21.5 to 10^23 per sq cm. We compare the gas to dust absorption
signatures in these stars and find Nh= A_v x 2 x 10^21 cm^-2. We find that the
cluster contains 31 candidate OB stars and is centered about 10"" (0.1 pc) west
of the primary source of the ionization, the O5 star IRS 2. The cluster has a
peak central density of about 400 X-ray sources pc^-2. We estimate that the
total cluster membership exceeds 2000 stars.",2006-05-03T16:12:33Z
"Formation of Spiral-Arm Spurs and Bound Clouds in Vertically Stratified
  Galactic Gas Disks","(Abridged) We investigate the growth of spiral-arm substructure in vertically
stratified, self-gravitating, galactic gas disks, using local numerical MHD
simulations. Our new models extend our previous 2D studies (Kim & Ostriker
2002), which showed that a magnetized spiral shock in a thin disk can undergo
magneto-Jeans instability (MJI), resulting in interarm spur structures and
massive fragments. Similar spur features have recently been seen in
high-resolution observations of several galaxies. Here, we consider two sets of
numerical models: 2D models that use a thick-disk gravitational kernel, and 3D
runs with explicit vertical stratification. When disks are sufficiently
magnetized and self-gravitating, the result in both sorts of models is the
growth of spiral-arm substructure similar to that in our previous razor-thin
models. Reduced self-gravity in thick disks increases the spur spacing to ~10
times the Jeans length at the arm peak. Bound clouds that form from spur
fragmentation have masses ~(1-3)x10^7 Msun each, a factor ~3-8 times larger
than in razor-thin models with the same gas surface density and stellar spiral
arm strength. We find that unmagnetized or weakly magnetized 2D models are
unstable to the wiggle instability (WI) previously identified by Wada & Koda
(2004), and proposed as a potential spur- and clump-forming mechanism.
However,our fully 3D models do not show this effect. Non-steady motions and
strong vertical shear prevent coherent vortical structures from forming,
evidently suppressing the WI that appears in 2D (isothermal) runs. We also find
no clear traces of Parker instability in the nonlinear spiral arm substructures
that emerge (in self-gravitating models), although conceivably Parker modes may
help seed the MJI at early stages since azimuthal wavelengths are similar.",2006-03-28T06:28:09Z

The Impact of Cosmic Dust on Supernova Cosmology,"Extinction by intergalactic gray dust introduces a magnitude redshift
dependent offset in the standard-candle relation of SN Ia. This leads to
overestimated luminosity distances compared to a dust-free universe.
Quantifying the amplitude of this systematic effect is crucial for an accurate
determination of the dark energy parameters. In this paper we model the gray
dust extinction in terms of the star-formation history of the universe and the
physical properties of the dust grains. We focus on a class of cosmic dust
models which satisfy current observational constraints. These can produce an
extinction as large as 0.08 mag at z=1.7 and potentially disrupt the dark
energy parameter inference from future SN surveys. In particular depending on
the dust model we find that an unaccounted extinction can bias the estimation
of a constant dark energy equation of state w by shifting its best fit value up
to 20% from its true value. Near-IR broadband photometry will hardly detect
this effect, while the induced decrement of the Balmer lines requires high
signal-to-noise spectra. Indeed IR-spectroscopy will be needed for high
redshift SNe. Cosmic dust extinction may also cause a detectable violation of
the distance-duality relation. A more comprehensive knowledge of the physics of
the IGM is necessary for an accurate modeling of intergalactic dust. Due to the
large magnitude dispersion current luminosity distance measurements are
insensitive to such possible extinction effects. In contrast these must be
taken into account if we hope to disclose the true nature of dark energy with
the upcoming generation of SN Ia surveys.",2006-03-30T21:00:04Z
Nature of giant pulses in radio pulsars,"Formation of giant radio pulses is attributed to propagation effects in the
plasma of pulsar magnetosphere. Induced scattering of radio waves by the plasma
particles is found to lead to an efficient redistribution of the radio emission
in frequency. With the steep spectrum of pulsar radiation, intensity transfer
between the widely spaced frequencies may imply significant narrow-band
amplification of the radiation. This may give rise to giant pulses. It is
demonstrated that the statistics of giant pulse intensities observed can be
reproduced if one take into account pulse-to-pulse fluctuations of the plasma
number density and the original intensity. Polarization properties of the
strongly amplified pulses, their location in the average pulse window and the
origin of the nanostructure of giant pulses are discussed as well.",2006-05-05T09:23:43Z
The importance of nuclear masses in the astrophysical rp-process,"The importance of mass measurements for astrophysical capture processes in
general, and for the rp-process in X-ray bursts in particular is discussed. A
review of the current uncertainties in the effective lifetimes of the major
waiting points 64Ge, 68Se, and 72Kr demonstrates that despite of recent
measurements uncertainties are still significant. It is found that mass
measurements with an accuracy of the order of 10 keV or better are desirable,
and that reaction rate uncertainties play a critical role as well.",2006-07-27T18:49:04Z
"Evidence for strong evolution of the cosmic star formation density at
  high redshift","Deep HST/ACS and VLT/ISAAC data of the GOODS-South field were used to look
for high-redshift galaxies in the rest-frame UV wavelength range and to study
the evolution of the cosmic star-formation density at z~7. The GOODS-South area
was surveyed down to a limiting magnitude of about (J+Ks)=25.5 looking for
drop-out objects in the z ACS filter. The large sampled area would allow for
the detection of galaxies which are 20 times less numerous and 1-2 magnitudes
brighter than similar studies using HST/NICMOS near-IR data. Two objects were
initially selected as promising candidates of galaxies at z~7, but have
subsequently been dismissed and identified as Galactic brown dwarfs through a
detailed analysis of their morphology and Spitzer colors, as well as through
spectroscopic information. As a consequence, we conclude that there are no
galaxies at z~7 down to our limiting magnitude in the field we investigated.
Our non detection of galaxies at z~7 provides clear evidence for a strong
evolution of the luminosity function between z=6 and z=7, i.e. over a time
interval of only ~170 Myr. Our constraints also provide evidence for a
significant decline of the total star formation rate at z=7, which must be less
than 40% of that at z=3 and 40-80% of that at z=6. We also derive an upper
limit to the ionizing flux at z=7, which is only marginally consistent with
that required to completely ionize the Universe.",2006-07-07T17:17:27Z
Shock excitation of the knots of Hen 3-1475,"We present new optical STIS HST spectroscopic observations of the jets of the
proto-planetary nebula Hen 3-1475. The excitation conditions of the knots of
Hen 3-1475 are derived from the observed optical spectra, confirming that the
knots are shock excited. The shocked spectra are qualitatively reproduced by
simple ``3/2''D bow shock models. We present a set of bow shock models devoted
to planetary nebulae, and discuss the effects of the pre-ionization conditions,
the bow shock velocity, the bow shock shape and the chemical abundances on the
predicted spectra.
  To explore the reliability of the ``3/2''D bow shock models, we also compare
the observed spectra of other three proto-planetary nebulae (M 1-92, M 2-56 and
CRL 618) to the predicted spectra.",2006-05-10T12:56:06Z
"GRAVITY: The adaptive optics assisted, two object beam combiner for the

interferometric imaging will realize the most advanced vision of
optical/infrared interferometry with the VLT. Our most ambitious science goal
is to study motions within a few times the event horizon size of the Galactic

Smooth Boundaries to Cosmological HII Regions from Galaxy Clustering,"The HII regions around quasars and galaxies at redshifts beyond the epoch of
reionisation will provide prime targets for upcoming 21cm campaigns using a new
generation of low-frequency radio observatories. Here we show that the
boundaries of these HII regions will not be sharp. Rather, the clustering of
sources near massive galaxies results in a neutral fraction that rises
gradually towards large radii from an interior value near zero. A neutral
fraction corresponding to the global background value is typically reached at a
distance of 2-5 times the radius of the HII region around the central massive
galaxy.",2006-07-12T02:33:37Z
"Effects of dust scattering albedo and 2175 A bump on ultraviolet colours
  of normal disc galaxies","We discuss dust properties in the interstellar medium (ISM) of nearby normal
galaxies, by comparing observations in the ultraviolet (UV) with simulations by
a radiative transfer model. The observed UV colours of nearby galaxies show a
reddening relative to their expected intrinsic colours. Some authors argued
that the Milky Way dust cannot reproduce the reddening because of the prominent
2175 \AA absorption bump. Other authors proposed a reduction mechanism of the
bump strength in an {\it attenuation law} derived from the ratio of the
observed intensity to the intrinsic one through an age-selective attenuation
(i.e., young stars are more attenuated selectively). We newly find that the
wavelength dependence of the scattering albedo also has a strong effect on the
UV colour; an albedo decreasing toward shorter wavelengths (except for the
absorption bump range) produces a significant UV reddening. After comparing the
observed UV colours of nearby normal galaxies with those expected from
radiative transfer simulations assumed several dust models, we find two sorts
of dust suitable for these galaxies: (1) dust with a bump and a smaller albedo
for a shorter wavelength (except for the bump range), and (2) dust without any
bump but with an almost constant albedo. If very small carbonaceous grains
responsible for the common unidentified infrared emission band are also the
bump carrier, the former dust is favorable. Finally, we derive mean attenuation
laws of various dust models as a function of the UV attenuation, and derive
some relations between the UV attenuation and observable/theoretical
quantities.",2006-05-06T06:48:12Z
Simulations of Cosmic Chemical Enrichment,"Using a new numerical model for cosmic chemical evolution, we study the
influence of hypernova feedback on the star formation and metal enrichment
history of the universe. For assumptions which produce plausible results in
idealized collapse models of individual galaxies, our cosmological simulations
of the standard Lambda-CDM cosmology show a peak of the cosmic star formation
rate at z~4, with ~10% of the baryons turning into stars. We find that the
majority of stars in present-day massive galaxies formed in much smaller
galaxies at high redshifts, giving them a mean stellar age as old as 10 Gyr,
despite their late assembly times. The hypernova feedback drives galactic
outflows efficiently in low mass galaxies, and these winds eject heavy elements
into the intergalactic medium. The ejected baryon fraction is larger for less
massive galaxies, correlates well with stellar metallicity, and amounts to ~20%
of all baryons in total. The resulting enrichment history is broadly consistent
with the observed abundances of Lyman break galaxies, of damped Lyman alpha
systems, and of the intergalactic medium. The metallicity of the cold gas in
galaxies increases with galaxy mass, which is comparable to observations with a
significant scatter. The stellar mass-metallicity relation of the observed
galaxy population is well reproduced by the simulation model as a result of
mass-dependent galactic winds. However, star formation does not terminate in
massive galaxies at late times in our model, and too few dwarf galaxies are
still forming stars. These problems may be due to a lack of resolution, to
inappropriate modelling of supernova feedback, or to a neglect of other
feedback processes such as active galactic nuclei.",2006-04-05T18:10:13Z
"Optical/near-infrared observations of the black hole candidate XTE
  J1720-318: from high-soft to low-hard state","Aims: To gain a better understanding of high-energy Galactic sources, we
observed the Galactic X-ray binary and black hole candidate XTE J1720-318 in
the optical and near-infrared, just after the onset of its X-ray outburst in
January, 2003. These observations were obtained with the ESO/NTT as the Target
of Opportunity, in February and April 2003. Methods: We performed an accurate
astrometry and analysed photometrical and spectroscopic observations. We then
produced a colour-magnitude diagram, looked at the overall evolution of the
multi-wavelength light curve, and analysed the spectral energy distribution.
Results: We discovered the optical counterpart in the R-band (R ~ 21.5) and
confirmed the near-infrared counterpart. We show that, for an absorption
between 6 and 8 magnitudes, XTE J1720-318 is likely to be an intermediate mass
X-ray binary located at a distance between 3 and 10 kpc, hosting a main
sequence star of spectral type between late B and early G. Our second set of
observations took place simultaneously with the third secondary outburst
present in X-ray and near-infrared light curves. The evolution of its spectral
energy distribution shows that XTE J1720-318 entered a transition from a
high-soft to a low-hard state in-between the two observations.",2006-05-11T16:34:56Z
"Neutral hydrogen in nearby elliptical and lenticular galaxies: the
  continuing formation of early-type galaxies","(Abridged) We present deep WSRT observations of neutral hydrogen in 12 nearby
elliptical and lenticular galaxies. The selected objects come from a
representative sample of nearby galaxies earlier studied at optical wavelengths
with the integral-field spectrograph Sauron. We detect HI - both in regular
discs as well as in clouds and tails off-set from the host galaxy - in 70% of
the galaxies. This detection rate is much higher than in previous, shallower
single-dish surveys, and is similar to that for the ionised gas. The results
suggest that at faint detection levels the presence of HI is a relatively
common characteristic of field early-type galaxies. The observed total HI
masses range between a few times 10^6 Msun to just over 10^9 Msun. The presence
of regular disc-like structures is a situation as common as HI in offset clouds
and tails around early-type galaxies. All galaxies where HI is detected also
contain ionised gas, whereas no HI is found around galaxies without ionised
gas. Galaxies with regular HI discs tend to have strong emission from ionised
gas. In these cases, the similar kinematics of the neutral hydrogen and ionised
gas suggest that they form one structure. We do not find a clear trend between
the presence of HI and the global age of the stellar population or the global
dynamical characteristics of the galaxies. Our observations support the idea
that gas accretion is common and does not happen exclusively in peculiar
early-type galaxies. For the majority of the cases the gas is likely acquired
through merging, but the lack of correlation with the stellar population age
suggests that smooth, cold accretion could be an alternative scenario, at least
in some galaxies. In either cases, the data suggest that early-type galaxies
continue to build their mass up to the present.",2006-06-12T08:35:30Z
Arecibo and the ALFA Pulsar Survey,"The recently started Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA) pulsar survey aims to
find ~1000 new pulsars. Due to its high time and frequency resolution the
survey is especially sensitive to millisecond pulsars, which have the potential
to test gravitational theories, detect gravitational waves and probe the
neutron-star equation of state. Here we report the results of our preliminary
analysis: in the first months we have discovered 21 new pulsars. One of these,
PSR J1906+0746, is a young 144-ms pulsar in a highly relativistic 3.98-hr
low-eccentricity orbit. The 2.61 +- 0.02 solar-mass system is expected to

"Recurrence of the blue wing enhancements in the high ionization lines of
  SDSS 1004+4112 A","We present integral field spectroscopic observations of the quadruple-lensed
QSO SDSS 1004+4112 taken with the fiber system INTEGRAL at the William Herschel
Telescope on 2004 January 19. In May 2003 a blueward enhancement in the high
ionization lines of SDSS 1004+4112A was detected and then faded. Our
observations are the first to note a second event of similar characteristics
less than one year after. Although initially attributed to microlensing, the
resemblance among the spectra of both events and the absence of
microlensing-induced changes in the continuum of component A are puzzling. The
lack of a convincing explanation under the microlensing or intrinsic
variability hypotheses makes the observed enhancements particularly relevant,
calling for close monitoring of this object.",2006-05-20T00:48:14Z
Non-thermal emission from early-type stars,"Massive, early-type stars deposit energy and momentum in the interstellar
medium through dense, supersonic winds. These objects are one of the most
important sources of ionising radiation and chemical enrichment in the Galaxy.
The physical conditions in the winds give rise to thermal and non-thermal
emission, detectable from radio to gamma rays. In this report the relevant
radiation processes will be described and studies on particular systems will be
presented, discussing the information provided by multifrequency observations.
Future steps aiming at understanding the stellar wind phenomenon as a whole
will be outlined.",2006-03-22T21:03:26Z
Intracluster Planetary Nebulae,"I review the progress in research on intracluster planetary nebulae over the
last five years. Hundreds more intracluster planetary nebulae have been
detected in the nearby Virgo and Fornax galaxy clusters, searches of several
galaxy groups have been made, and intracluster planetary candidates have been
detected in the distant Coma cluster. The first theoretical studies of
intracluster planetaries have also been completed, studying their utility as
tracers of the intracluster light as a whole, and also as individual objects.
  From the results to date, it appears that intracluster planetaries are common
in galaxy clusters (10-20% of the total amount of starlight), but thus far,
none have been detected in galaxy groups, a result which currently is not well
understood. Limited spectroscopic follow-up of intracluster planetaries in
Virgo indicate that they have a complex velocity structure, in agreement with
numerical models of intracluster light. Hydrodynamic simulations of individual
intracluster planetaries predict that their morphology is significantly altered
by their intracluster environment, but their emission-line properties appear to
be unaffected.",2006-06-07T20:24:12Z
Systematic quantum corrections to screening in thermonuclear fusion,"We develop a series expansion of the plasma screening length away from the
classical limit in powers of $\hbar^{2}$. It is shown that the leading order
quantum correction increases the screening length in solar conditions by
approximately 2% while it decreases the fusion rate by approximately $ 0.34%$.
We also calculate the next higher order quantum correction which turns out to
be approximately 0.05%.",2006-06-13T15:28:28Z
"Searching for flickering variability in several symbiotic stars and
  related objects: BX Mon, V471 Per, RS Oph, V627 Cas, CI Cam V886 Her, Z And,
  T CrB, MWC 560, V407 Cyg","UBVRI photometry observations of 10 symbiotic stars and related objects
obtained in the period 2002-2003 are presented. Analysing differential light
curves we found rapid light variations with timescales of tens of minutes and
significant amplitudes in the well-known flickerers MWC 560, RS Oph, V407 Cyg
and T CrB. MWC 560 and V407 Cyg demonstrate quasi periodic oscillations (QPO)
with similar amplitudes and timescales. Flickering and unusual flare in V627
Cas as well as some indications of flickering presence in BX Mon are detected.
The existence of 29 minutes oscillations in Z And with an amplitude about 0.02
mag in U band is confirmed. Only one symbiotic star, V471 Per, and both non
symbiotic, CI Cam and V886 Her seem to be constant on flickering timescales.
Nevertheless, small night to night changes in the brightness of V886 Her were
observed as well.",2006-04-05T07:31:03Z
"AEGIS: Enhancement of Dust-enshrouded Star Formation in Close Galaxy
  Pairs and Merging Galaxies up to z ~ 1","Using data from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey and HST/ACS imaging in the
Extended Groth Strip, we select nearly 100 interacting galaxy systems including
kinematic close pairs and morphologically identified merging galaxies. Spitzer
MIPS 24 micron fluxes of these systems reflect the current dusty star formation
activity, and at a fixed stellar mass (M_{*}) the median infrared luminosity
(L_{IR}) among merging galaxies and close pairs of blue galaxies is twice (1.9
+/- 0.4) that of control pairs drawn from isolated blue galaxies. Enhancement
declines with galaxy separation, being strongest in close pairs and mergers and
weaker in wide pairs compared to the control sample. At z ~ 0.9, 7.1% +/- 4.3%
of massive interacting galaxies (M_{*} > 2*10^{10} M_{solar}) are found to be
ULIRGs, compared to 2.6% +/- 0.7% in the control sample. The large spread of IR
luminosity to stellar mass ratio among interacting galaxies suggests that this
enhancement may depend on the merger stage as well as other as yet unidentified
factors (e.g., galaxy structure, mass ratio, orbital characteristics, presence
of AGN or bar). The contribution of interacting systems to the total IR
luminosity density is moderate (<= 36 %).",2006-07-13T03:05:10Z

"Jet Sideways Expansion Effect on Estimating the Gamma-Ray Burst
  Efficiency","The high efficiency of converting kinetic energy into gamma-rays estimated
with late-time afterglows in Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) phenomenon challenges the
commonly accepted internal-shock model. However, the efficiency is still highly
uncertain because it is sensitive to many effects. In this Letter we study the
sideways expansion effect of jets on estimating the efficiency. We find that
this effect is considerable, reducing the efficiency by a factor of $\sim0.5$
for typical parameters, when the afterglow data $\sim 10$ hr after the GRB
trigger are used to derive the kinetic energy. For a more dense circumburst
medium, this effect is more significant. As samples, taking this effect into
account, we specifically calculate the efficiency of two bursts whose
parameters were well constrained. Almost the same results are derived. This
suggests that the sideways expansion effect should be considered when the GRB
efficiency is estimated with the late afterglow data.",2006-03-23T08:19:19Z
"Properties of the $δ$ Scorpii Circumstellar Disk from Continuum
  Modeling","We present optical $WBVR$ and infrared $JHKL$ photometric observations of the
Be binary system $\delta$ Sco, obtained in 2000--2005, mid-infrared (10 and $18
\mu$m) photometry and optical ($\lambda\lambda$ 3200--10500 \AA)
spectropolarimetry obtained in 2001. Our optical photometry confirms the
results of much more frequent visual monitoring of $\delta$ Sco. In 2005, we
detected a significant decrease in the object's brightness, both in optical and
near-infrared brightness, which is associated with a continuous rise in the
hydrogen line strenghts. We discuss possible causes for this phenomenon, which
is difficult to explain in view of current models of Be star disks. The 2001
spectral energy distribution and polarization are succesfully modeled with a
three-dimensional non-LTE Monte Carlo code which produces a self-consistent
determination of the hydrogen level populations, electron temperature, and gas
density for hot star disks. Our disk model is hydrostatically supported in the
vertical direction and radially controlled by viscosity. Such a disk model has,
essentially, only two free parameters, viz., the equatorial mass loss rate and
the disk outer radius. We find that the primary companion is surrounded by a
small (7 $R_\star$), geometrically-thin disk, which is highly non-isothermal
and fully ionized. Our model requires an average equatorial mass loss rate of
$1.5\times 10^{-9} M_{\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$.",2006-03-10T17:39:11Z
"The DRaGONS Survey: A Search for High Redshift Radio Galaxies And
  Heavily Obscured AGNs","We present the first results from the Distant Radio Galaxies Optically
Non-detected in the SDSS (DRaGONS) Survey. Using a novel selection technique
for identifying high redshift radio galaxy (HzRG) candidates, a large sample of
bright (S_{1.4GHz} > 100mJy) radio sources from the FIRST survey having no
optical counterpart in the SDSS is compiled. K-band imaging with the FLAMINGOS
instrument on the 4-meter telescope at Kitt Peak for 96 such candidates allows
preliminary identification of HzRG candidates through the well-known K-z
relation. Of the initial candidates, we identify 70 with magnitudes brighter
than K \approx 19.5, and compute limiting magnitudes for the remainder.
Assigning redshifts based on the K-z Hubble diagram gives a mean redshift for
our sample of z=2.5 and a median redshift of z=2.0. This selection is also
sensitive to a previously unseen population of anomalously red radio galaxies
(r-K > 6.5-7), which may indicate significant obscuration at moderate
redshifts. These obscured objects can be used to test the completeness of QSO
surveys to the effects of reddenning. More than ten percent of our sample falls
into this category, which may represent a sizable radio loud population missing
from current optically selected AGN samples. We additionally identify 479
bright Extremely Red Objects (EROs) in the fields surrounding our HzRG
candidates, to a magnitude of K=17.5, within a non-contiguous area of 2.38
square degrees. This constitutes a small overdensity of EROs surrounding the
radio galaxy candidates over random fields, and we see possible evidence for a
physical association of the EROs with the radio galaxies. However, examining
the clustering of all K < 19.0 galaxies around the radio targets reveals no
evidence of a global galaxy excess.",2006-06-13T19:11:19Z
Evidence for Heating of Neutron Stars by Magnetic Field Decay,"We show the existence of a strong trend between neutron star surface
temperature and the dipolar component of the magnetic field extending through
three orders of field magnitude, a range that includes magnetars, radio-quiet
isolated neutron stars, and many ordinary radio pulsars. We suggest that this
trend can be explained by the decay of currents in the crust over a time scale
of few Myr. We estimate the minimum temperature that a NS with a given magnetic
field can reach in this interpretation.",2006-07-26T07:38:09Z
"Infalling Faint [OII] Emitters in Abell 851. II. Environment,
  Kinematics, and Star Formation History","We report on the environments, kinematics, and SFH of [OII]-selected objects
in the z=0.4 galaxy cluster A851, using Keck optical spectra. A large fraction
(~55%) of cluster [OII] emitters show strong Balmer absorptions (>4A in
equivalent width at Hd). These e(a) spectra have been attributed to dusty
starburst galaxies, an interpretation supported by our reddening measurements,
which show a high frequency of very reddened [EBV>0.5] [OII] emitters. Our
spectral modeling requires starburst ages >1Gyr, shorter than the cluster
crossing timescale. We argue that this starburst phase occurs during cluster
infall based on the radial velocity distribution of the cluster [OII] emitters,
which present a deficit of systems near the cluster systemic velocity. The
spatial segregation of some redshifted and blueshifted groups strongly
indicates that the accretion was recent. Throughout the cluster, the fraction
in [OII] emitters is a strong function of the local galaxy density. Our
analysis supports previous suggestions that dusty starburst galaxies arise at
the expense of gas-rich spiral galaxies. In addition, we describe a fainter
[OII]-emitting population, comprised largely of dwarf galaxies and find an even
stronger suppression of [OII] emission in high density environments among this
subsample, indicative of more effective destruction by harassment and/or
gas-stripping. Comparison to previous morphological studies, limited to the
core of A851, suggests that galaxy-galaxy interactions may trigger the
starbursts. The high e(a) galaxy fraction in A851 compared to that in the
field, however, suggests that some cluster-specific mechanism, likely related
to the dynamical assembly of the cluster, also contributes to the high number
of starbursts. (abridged)",2006-05-01T21:28:38Z
A Survey for Spectroscopic Binaries Among Very Low-Mass Stars,"We report on the results of a survey for radial velocity variability in a
heterogeneous sample of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. One
distinguishing characteristic of the survey is its timespan, which allows an
overlap between spectroscopic binaries and those which can be found by high
angular-resolution imaging. We are able to place a new constraint on the total
binary fraction in these objects, which suggests that they are more likely the
result of extending the same processes at work at higher masses into this mass
range, rather than a distinct mode of formation. Our basic result is that there
are $6 \pm 2$ out of 53, or $11^{+0.07}_{-0.04}$% spectroscopic binaries in the
separation range 0-6 AU, nearly as many as resolved binaries. This leads to an
estimate of an upper limit of $26 \pm 10$% for the binary fraction of VLM
objects (it is an upper limit because of the possible overlap between the
spectroscopic and resolved populations). A reasonable estimate for the very
low-mass binary fraction is $20 - 25$%. We consider several possible separation
and frequency distributions, including the same one as found for GK stars, a
compressed version of that, a version of the compressed distribution truncated
at 15 AU, and a theoretical distribution which considers the evaporation of
small-N clusters. We conclude that the latter two bracket the observations,
which may mean that these systems form with intrinsically smaller separations
due to their smaller mass, and then are truncated due to their smaller binding
energy. We do not find support for the ``ejection hypothesis'' as their
dominant mode of formation, particularly in view of the similarity in the total
binary fraction compared with slightly more massive stars, and the difficulty
this mechanism has in producing numerous binary systems.",2006-04-12T07:51:53Z
Testing General Relativity with High-Resolution Imaging of Sgr A*,"Submilliarcsecond astrometry and imaging of the black hole Sgr A* at the
Galactic Center may become possible in the near future at infrared and
submillimetre wavelengths. This resolution is sufficient to observe the
silhouette the supermassive black hole in the Galactic center casts upon
background emission. However, more exciting is the prospect of observing ``hot
spots'' in the accretion flow. Here we discuss how such measurements may be
used to test not only the consistency of General Relativity, but also the
validity of the Kerr metric in particular.",2006-07-12T21:22:44Z
"Asteroseismic inferences on GW Vir variable stars in the frame of new PG
  1159 evolutionary models","An adiabatic, nonradial pulsation study of GW Vir stars is presented. The
pulsation calculations are based on PG1159 evolutionary sequences with
different stellar massess artificially derived from a full evolutionary
sequence of 0.5895 Mo that has been computed taking into account the
evolutionary history of the progenitor star. The artificial sequences were
constructed by appropriately scaling the stellar mass of the 0.5895 Mo sequence
well before the models reach the low-luminosity, high-gravity stage of the GW
Vir domain. We compute g-mode pulsation periods appropriate to GW Vir variable
stars. The implications for the mode-trapping properties of our PG 1159 models
are discussed at length. We found that the mode-trapping features
characterizing our PG 1159 models are mostly fixed by the stepped shape of the
core chemical profile left by prior convective overshooting. This is
particularly true at least for the range of periods observed in GW Vir stars.
In addition, we make asteroseismic inferences about the internal structure of
the GW Vir stars PG 1159-035, PG 2131+066, PG 1707+427 and PG 0122+200.",2006-03-27T17:25:26Z
"Few Skewed Disks Found in First Closure-Phase Survey of Herbig Ae/Be
  stars","Using the 3-telescope IOTA interferometer on Mt. Hopkins, we report results
from the first near-infrared (lambda=1.65 mu) closure-phase survey of Young
Stellar Objects (YSOs). These closure phases allow us to unambiguously detect
departures from centrosymmetry (i.e., skew) in the emission pattern from YSO
disks on the scale of ~4 milliarcseconds, expected from generic ``flared disk''
models. Six of fourteen targets showed small, yet statistically-significant,
non-zero closure phases, with largest values from the young binary system MWC
361-A and the (pre-main sequence?) Be star HD 45677. Our observations are quite
sensitive to the vertical structure of the inner disk and we confront the
predictions of the ``puffed-up inner wall'' models of Dullemond, Dominik, and
Natta (DDN). Our data support disks models with curved inner rims because the
expected emission appear symmetrically-distributed around the star over a wide
range of inclination angles. In contrast, our results are incompatible with the
models possessing vertical inner walls because they predict extreme skewness
(i.e., large closure phases) from the near-IR disk emission that is not seen in
our data. In addition, we also present the discovery of mysterious H-band
``halos'' (~5-10% of light on scales 0.01-0.50 arcsec) around a few objects, a
preliminary ``parametric imaging'' study for HD 45677, and the first
astrometric orbit for the young binary MWC 361-A.",2006-06-02T13:52:02Z
Detection of H2D+ in a massive prestellar core in Orion B,"Aims. The purpose of this study is to examine the prediction that the
deuterated H3+ ion, H2D+, can be found exclusively in the coldest regions of
molecular cloud cores. This is also a feasibility study for the detection of
the ground-state line of ortho-H2D+ at 372 GHz with APEX.
  Methods. The 1(10)-1(11) transition of H2D+ at 372 GHz was searched towards
selected positions in the massive star forming cloud OriB9, in the dark cloud
L183, and in the low- to intermediate mass star-forming cloud R CrA.
  Results. The line was detected in cold, prestellar cores in the regions of
OriB9 and L183, but only upper limits were obtained towards other locations
which either have elevated temperatures or contain a newly born star. The H2D+
detection towards OriB9 is the first one in a massive star-forming region. The
fractional ortho-H2D+ abundances (relative to H2) are estimated to be about
1.0E-10 in two cold cores in OriB9, and 3.0E-10 in the cold core of L183.
  Conclusions. The H2D+ detection in OriB9 shows that also massive star forming
regions contain very cold prestellar cores which probably have reached matured
chemical composition characterized, e.g., by a high degree of deuterium
fractionation. Besides as a tracer of the interior parts of prestellar cores,
H2D+ may therefore be used to put contraints on the timescales related to
massive star formation.",2006-06-06T09:12:43Z
"Statistical analysis of BATSE gamma-ray bursts: Self-similarity and the
  Amati-relation","The statistical properties of a complete, flux limited sample of 197 long
gamma--ray bursts (GRBs) detected by BATSE are studied. In order to bring forth
their main characteristics, care was taken to define a representative set of
ten parameters. A multivariate analysis gives that ~70% of the total variation
in parameter values is driven by only three principal components. The variation
of the temporal parameters is clearly distinct from that of the spectral ones.
A close correlation is found between the half-width of the autocorrelation
function (tau) and the emission time (Tem); most importantly, this correlation
is self-similar in the sense that the mean values and dispersions of both tau
and Tem scale with the duration of the burst (T90). It is shown that the
Amati-relation can be derived from the sample and that the scatter around this
relation is correlated with the value of tau. Hence, tau has a role similar to
that of the break in the afterglow light curve (Tb) in the Ghirlanda-relation.
In the standard GRB-scenario, the close relation between a global parameter
(Tb) and a local one (tau) indicates that some of the jet-properties do not
vary much for different lines of sight. Finally, it is argued that the basic
temporal and spectral properties are associated with individual pulses, while
the overall properties of a burst is determined mainly by the number of pulses.",2006-06-20T15:31:00Z
"New ""Bigs"" in cosmology","This paper contains a detailed discussion on new cosmic solutions describing
the early and late evolution of a universe that is filled with a kind of dark
energy that may or may not satisfy the energy conditions. The main distinctive
property of the resulting space-times is that they make to appear twice the
single singular events predicted by the corresponding quintessential (phantom)
models in a manner which can be made symmetric with respect to the origin of
cosmic time. Thus, big bang and big rip singularity are shown to take place
twice, one on the positive branch of time and the other on the negative one. We
have also considered dark energy and phantom energy accretion onto black holes
and wormholes in the context of these new cosmic solutions. It is seen that the
space-times of these holes would then undergo swelling processes leading to big
trip and big hole events taking place on distinct epochs along the evolution of
the universe. In this way, the possibility is considered that the past and
future be connected in a non-paradoxical manner in the universes described by
means of the new symmetric solutions.",2006-06-21T17:39:07Z
"Spitzer/MIPS Limits on Asteroidal Dust in the Pulsar Planetary System
  PSR B1257+1","With the MIPS camera on Spitzer, we have searched for far-infrared emission
from dust in the planetary system orbiting pulsar PSR 1257+12. With accuracies
of 0.05 mJy at 24 um and 1.5 mJy at 70 um, photometric measurements find no
evidence for emission at these wavelengths. These observations place new upper
limits on the luminosity of dust with temperatures between 20 and 1000 K. They
are particularly sensitive to dust temperatures of 100-200 K, for which they
limit the dust luminosity to below $3 \times 10^{-5}$ of the pulsar's spin-down
luminosity, three orders of magnitude better than previous limits. Despite
these improved constraints on dust emission, an asteroid belt similar to the
Solar System's cannot be ruled out.",2006-04-05T22:08:54Z
Long-term variation in distribution of sunspot groups,"We studied the relation between the distribution of sunspot groups and the
Gleissberg cycle. As the magnetic field is related to the area of the sunspot
groups, we used area-weighted sunspot group data. On the one hand, we confirm
the previously reported long-term cyclic behaviour of the sum of the northern
and southern sunspot group mean latitudes, although we found a somewhat longer
period (P~104 years). We introduced the difference between the ensemble average
area of sunspot groups for the two hemispheres, which turns out to show similar
behaviour. We also investigated a further aspect of the Gleissberg cycle where
while in the 19th century the consecutive Schwabe cycles are sharply separated
from each other, one century later the cycles overlap each other more and more.",2006-06-02T14:11:35Z
"The AGN Outflow in the HDFS Target QSO J2233-606 from a High-Resolution
  VLT/UVES Spectrum","We present a detailed analysis of the intrinsic UV absorption in the central
HDFS target QSO J2233-606, based on a high-resolution, high S/N (~25 -- 50)
spectrum obtained with VLT/UVES. This spectrum samples the cluster of intrinsic
absorption systems outflowing from the AGN at radial velocities v ~ -5000 --
-3800 km/s in the key far-UV diagnostic lines - the lithium-like CNO doublets
and H I Lyman series. We fit the absorption troughs using a global model of all
detected lines to solve for the independent velocity-dependent covering factors
of the continuum and emission-line sources and ionic column densities. This
reveals increasing covering factors in components with greater outflow
velocity. Narrow substructure is revealed in the optical depth profiles,
suggesting the relatively broad absorption is comprised of a series of multiple
components. We perform velocity-dependent photoionization modeling, which
allows a full solution to the C, N, and O abundances, as well as the velocity
resolved ionization parameter and total column density. The absorbers are found
to have supersolar abundances, with [C/H] and [O/H] ~0.5 -- 0.9, and [N/H] ~
1.1 -- 1.3, consistent with enhanced nitrogen production expected from
secondary nucleosynthesis processes. Independent fits to each kinematic
component give consistent results for the abundances. The lowest-ionization
material in each of the strong absorbers is modeled with similar ionization
parameters. Components of higher-ionization (indicated by stronger O VI
relative to C IV and N V) are present at velocities just redward of each
low-ionization absorber. We explore the implications of these results for the
kinematic-geometric-ionization structure of the outflow.",2006-04-17T18:18:41Z
"Detection regimes of the cosmological gravitational wave background from
  astrophysical sources","Key targets for gravitational wave (GW) observatories, such as LIGO and the
next generation interferometric detector, Advanced LIGO, include core-collapse
of massive stars and the final stage of coalescence of compact stellar
remnants. The combined GW signal from such events occurring throughout the
Universe will produce an astrophysical GW background (AGB), one that is
fundamentally different from the GW background by very early Universe
processes. One can classify contributions to the AGB for different classes of
sources based on the strength of the GW emissions from the individual sources,
their peak emission frequency, emission duration and their event rate density
distribution. This article provides an overview of the detectability regimes of
the AGB in the context of current and planned gravitational wave observatories.
We show that there are two important AGB signal detection regimes, which we
define as `continuous' and `popcorn noise'. We describe how the `popcorn noise'
AGB regime evolves with observation time and we discuss how this feature
distinguishes it from the GW background produced from very early Universe
processes.",2006-07-04T08:36:40Z
"A high-resolution spectral analysis of three carbon-enhanced metal-poor
  stars","We present results of an analysis of high-resolution spectra obtained with
the Subaru Telescope High Dispersion Spectrograph, of two Carbon-Enhanced
Metal-Poor stars, HE 1305+0007 and HE 1152-0355, and of the classical CH star
HD 5223. All of these stars have relatively low effective temperatures
(4000-4750 K) and high carbon abundances. The stellar atmospheric parameters
indicate that they all have surface gravities consistent with a present
location on the red-giant branch, and metallicities of [Fe/H] = -2.0 (HE
1305+0007, HD 5223) and [Fe/H]= -1.3 (HE 1152-0355). In addition to their large
enhancements of carbon all three stars exhibit strong enhancements of the
s-process elements relative to iron. HE 1305+0007 exhibits a large enhancement
of the 3rd-peak s-process element lead, with [Pb/Fe] = +2.37, as well as a high
abundance of the r-process element europium, [Eu/Fe] = +1.97. Thus, HE
1305+0007 joins the growing class of the so-called ``Lead Stars'', and also the
class of objects that exhibit the presence of both r-process and s-process
elements, the CEMP-r/s stars. The large enhancement of n-capture elements
exhibited by HE 1152-0355 and HD 5223 are more consistent with the abundance
patterns generally noticed in CH stars. The elemental abundance distributions
observed in these stars are discussed in the light of existing theories of CH
star formation, as well as the suggested formation scenarios of the CEMP-r/s
group.",2006-08-04T11:17:11Z
A Search for Fallback Disks in Four Young Supernova Remnants,"We report on our search for the optical/infrared counterparts to the central
compact objects in four young supernova remnants: Pup A, PKS 1209-52, RCW 103,
and Cas A. The X-ray point sources in these supernova remnants are excellent
targets for probing the existence of supernova fallback disks, since
irradiation of a disk by a central X-ray source should lead to an infrared
excess. We used ground-based optical and near-infrared imaging and Spitzer
Space Telescope mid-infrared imaging to search for optical/infrared
counterparts at the X-ray point source positions measured by the Chandra X-Ray
Observatory. We did not detect any counterparts, and hence find no evidence for
fallback disks around any of these sources. In PKS 1209-52, we are able to
exclude a nearby optical/infrared candidate counterpart. In RCW 103, a blend of
3 faint stars at the X-ray source position prevents us from deriving useful
limits. For the other targets, the upper limits on the infrared/X-ray flux
ratio are as deep as (1.0--1.7)$\times 10^{-4}$. Comparing these limits to the
ratio of $\approx 6\times10^{-5}$ measured for 4U 0142+61 (a young pulsar
recently found with an X-ray irradiated dust disk), we conclude that the
non-detection of any disks around young neutron stars studied here are
consistent with their relatively low X-ray luminosities, although we note that
a similar dust disk around the neutron star in Pup A should be detectable by
deeper infrared observations.",2006-06-28T17:02:21Z
"Properties of High Redshift Quasars-II: What does the quasar luminosity
  function tell us about super-massive black-hole evolution?","In the local universe, the masses of Super-Massive Black-Holes (SMBH) appear
to correlate with the physical properties of their hosts, including the mass of
the dark-matter halo. Using these clues as a starting point many studies have
produced models that can explain phenomena like the quasar luminosity function.
The shortcoming of this approach is that working models are not unique, and as
a result it is not always clear what input physics is being constrained. Here
we take a different approach. We identify critical parameters that describe the
evolution of SMBHs at high redshift, and constrain their parameter space based
on observations of high redshift quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We
find that the luminosity function taken in isolation is somewhat limited in its
ability to constrain SMBH evolution due to some strong degeneracies. This
explains the presence in the literature of a range of equally successful models
based on different physical hypotheses. Including the constraint of the local
SMBH to halo mass ratio breaks some of the degeneracies, and our results
suggest halo masses at z~4.8 of 10^{12.5+/-0.3}M_solar (with 90% confidence),
with a SMBH to halo mass ratio that decreases with time (>99%). We also find a
quasar luminosity to halo mass ratio that increases with halo mass (>99%).
These features need to be incorporated in all successful models of SMBH
evolution. On the other hand current observations do not permit any conclusions
regarding the evolution of quasar lifetime, or the SMBH occupation fraction in
dark matter halos.",2006-03-14T00:59:33Z

baryon resonance contributions have been added: one representing Delta(1232)
and the other multiple resonances around 1600MeV/c^2. The parametrized formulae
predict that all secondary particle spectra be harder by about 0.05 in
power-law indices than that of the incident proton and their inclusive
cross-sections be larger than those predicted by p-p interaction models based
on the Feynman scaling.",2006-05-23T06:00:18Z
"SCUBA polarisation observations of the magnetic fields in the prestellar
  cores L1498 and L1517B","We have mapped linearly polarized dust emission from the prestellar cores
L1498 and L1517B with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) using the
Submillimetre Common User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) and its polarimeter SCUBAPOL
at a wavelength of 850um. We use these measurements to determine the
plane-of-sky magnetic field orientation in the cores. In L1498 we see a
magnetic field across the peak of the core that lies at an offset of 19 degrees
to the short axis of the core. This is similar to the offsets seen in previous
observations of prestellar cores. To the southeast of the peak, in the
filamentary tail of the core, we see that the magnetic field has rotated to lie
almost parallel to the long axis of the filament. We hypothesise that the field
in the core may have decoupled from the field in the filament that connects the
core to the rest of the cloud. We use the Chandrasekhar-Fermi (CF) method to
measure the plane-of-sky field strength in the core of L1498 to be 10 +/- 7 uG.
  In L1517B we see a more gradual turn in the field direction from the northern
part of the core to the south. This appears to follow a twist in the filament
in which the core is buried, with the field staying at a roughly constant 25
degree offset to the short axis of the filament, also consistent with previous
observations of prestellar cores. We again use the CF method and calculate the
magnetic field strength in L1517B also to be 30 +/- 10 uG. Both cores appear to
be roughly virialised. Comparison with our previous work on somewhat denser
cores shows that, for the denser cores, thermal and non-thermal (including
magnetic) support are approximately equal, while for the lower density cores
studied here, thermal support dominates.",2006-03-29T09:57:28Z
"Early Star Formation, Nucleosynthesis, and Chemical Evolution in
  Proto-Galactic Clouds","We present numerical simulations to describe the nucleosynthesis and
evolution of pre-Galactic clouds in a model which is motivated by cold dark
matter simulations of hierarchical galaxy formation. We adopt a SN-induced
star-formation mechanism and follow the chemical enrichment and energy input by
Type II and Type Ia SNe. We utilize metallicity-dependent yields and include
finite stellar lifetimes. We derive the metallicity distribution functions, the
age-metallicity relation, and relative elemental abundances for a number of
alpha- and Fe-group elements. We find that the dispersion of the metallicity
distribution function of the outer halo is reproduced by contributions from
clouds with different initial conditions. Clouds with initial masses greater
than that of present globular clusters are found to survive the first 0.1 Gyr,
suggesting that such systems may have contributed to the formation of the first
stars, and could have been self-enriched. More massive clouds are only stable
when one assumes an initial mass function that is not biased towards massive
stars. The predicted relative abundances of some alpha- and Fe-group elements
show good agreement with the observed values down to metallicities below [Fe/H]
= -4 when the iron yields are reduced relative to stellar models. The observed
scatter is also reproduced for many elements including the observed bifurcation
in [alpha/Fe] for stars with low [Fe/H]. However, the predicted dispersion may
be too large for some alpha elements unless a limited range of progenitor
masses is assumed. The results suggest that the low-mass SNeII were absent at
the very low metallicities, and that the upper mass limit for the first stars
that contributed to nucleosynthesis may be < 40 solar masses.",2006-03-28T23:11:18Z
Map of the Galaxy in the 6.7 keV emission line,"We study the two dimensional surface brightness distribution of the Galactic
X-ray background emission outside the central degree around Sgr A* in the 6.7
keV line as measured by the PCA spectrometer of the RXTE observatory. The use
of the emission line instead of continuum (3-20 keV) radiation and application
of time variability filtering to the long data set allows us to strongly
suppress the contamination of the GRXE map by bright point sources. The surface
brightness in the 6.7 keV line demonstrates very good correspondence with the
near-infrared surface brightness over the whole Galaxy, supporting the notion
that the GRXE consists mostly of integrated emission from weak Galactic X-ray
sources. We find compatible linear correlations between near-infrared and 6.7
keV surface brightness for the bulge and disk of the Galaxy. This indicates
that the populations of weak X-ray sources making up the GRXE in the disk and
bulge are not significantly different.",2006-05-29T07:39:03Z
Halos and voids in a multifractal model of cosmic structure,"On the one hand, the large scale structure of matter is arguably scale
invariant, and, on the other hand, halos and voids are recognized as prominent
features of that structure. To unify both approaches, we propose to model the
dark matter distribution as a set of fractal distributions of halos of
different kinds. This model relies on the concept of multifractal as the most
general scaling distribution and on a plausible notion of halo as a singular
mass concentration in a multifractal. Voids arise as complementary to halos,
namely, as formed by regular mass depletions. To provide halos with definite
size and masses, we coarse-grain the dark matter distribution, using the length
given by the lower cutoff to scaling. This allows us to relate the halo mass
function to the multifractal spectrum. Hence, we find that a log-normal model
of the mass distribution nicely fits in this picture and, moreover, the
Press-Schechter mass function can be recovered as a bifractal limit.
  To support our model of fractal distributions of halos, we perform a
numerical study of the distribution produced in cosmological N-body
simulations. In the Virgo L-CDM GIF2 simulation, we indeed find fractal
distributions of halos with various dimensions and a halo mass function of
bifractal type. However, this mass function is not of Press-Schechter's type,
and we interprete it instead as caused by the undersampling of the distribution
at the scale of halos, due to discretization.",2006-04-10T17:15:13Z
"Noncommutative Black-Body Radiation: Implications On Cosmic Microwave

A simple model for the size-evolution of elliptical galaxies,"We use semi-analytical modelling of galaxy formation to predict the
redshift-size-evolution of elliptical galaxies. Using a simple model in which
relative sizes of elliptical galaxies of a given mass correlate with the
fraction of stars formed in a star burst during a major merger event, we are
able to reproduce the observed size redshif t evolution. The size evolution is
a result of the amount of cold gas available during the major merger. Mergers
at high redshifts are gas-rich and produce ellipticals with smaller sizes. In
particular we find a power-law relation between the sizes at different
redshifts, with the power-law index giving a measure of the relative amount of
dissipation during the mergers that lead to the formation of an elliptical. The
size evolution is found to be stronger for more massive galaxies as they
involve more gas at high redshifts when they form compared to less massive
ellipticals. Local ellipticals more massive than $5 \times 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$
will be approximately 4 times larger than their counterparts at $z=2$. Our
results indicate that the scatter in the size of similar massive present day
elliptical galaxies is a result of their formation epoch, with smaller
ellipticals being formed earlier.",2006-05-17T21:06:33Z
"Precise Radial Velocities of Giant Stars II. Pollux and its Planetary
  Companion","It has long been speculated that the observed periodic radial velocity
pattern for the K giant Pollux might be explained in terms of an orbiting
planetary companion. We have collected 80 high-resolution spectra for Pollux at
Lick Observatory yielding precise radial velocities with a mean error of 3.8
m/s, providing the most comprehensive and precise data set available for this
star. Our data confirm the periodicity previously seen in the radial
velocities. We derive a period of 589.7+/-3.5 days and, assuming a primary mass
of 1.86 M_Sun, a minimum companion mass of 2.9+/-0.3 M_Jup, consistent with
earlier determinations. No evidence for any periodicities is visible in our
analysis of the shapes of the spectral lines via the bisector method, so that
we conclude that evidence is accumulating and compelling for a planet around
Pollux. However, some last doubt remains about this interpretation, because
non-radial pulsations which might be present in giant stars could in principle
also explain the observed radial velocities, while the accompanying bisector
variations might be too small to be detectable with current data.",2006-07-07T13:51:22Z
Cosmological Constraints from the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey,"[abridged] We present a first cosmological analysis of a refined cluster
catalog from the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS). The input cluster sample is
derived from 72.07 square degrees of imaging data [...] The catalog contains
956 clusters over 0.35<z<0.95, limited by cluster richness and richness error.
The calibration of the survey images has been extensively cross-checked against
publicly available Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging [...] We analyze the
cluster sample via a general self-calibration technique including scatter in
the mass-richness relation [...]. We fit simultaneously for Omega_M and
sigma_8, and four parameters describing the calibration of cluster richness to
mass, its evolution with redshift, and scatter in the richness-mass relation.
The principal goal of this general analysis is to establish the consistency (or
lack thereof) between the fitted parameters (both cosmological and cluster mass
observables) and available results on both from independent measures. From an
unconstrained analysis, Omega_M and sigma_8 are 0.31+0.11-0.10 and
0.67+0.18-0.13 respectively. An analysis including Gaussian priors on the slope
and zeropoint of the mass-richness relation gives very similar results:
0.30+0.12-0.11 and 0.70+0.27-0.15. Both analyses are in good agreement with the
current literature. The parameters describing the mass-richness relation in the
unconstrained fit are also eminently reasonable and agree with existing
follow-up data on both the RCS-1 and other cluster samples. Our results
directly demonstrate that future surveys (optical and otherwise), with much
larger samples of clusters, can give constraints competitive with other probes
of cosmology.",2006-03-21T20:26:39Z
"GaBoDS: The Garching-Bonn Deep Survey VIII. Lyman-break galaxies in the
  ESO Deep Public Survey","Aims. The clustering properties of a large sample of U-dropouts are
investigated and compared to very precise results for B-dropouts from other
studies to identify a possible evolution from z=4 to z=3. Methods. A population
of ~8800 candidates for star-forming galaxies at z=3 is selected via the
well-known Lyman-break technique from a large optical multicolour survey (the
ESO Deep Public Survey). The selection efficiency, contamination rate, and
redshift distribution of this population are investigated by means of extensive
simulations. Photometric redshifts are estimated for every Lyman-break galaxy
(LBG) candidate from its UBVRI photometry yielding an empirical redshift
distribution. The measured angular correlation function is deprojected and the
resulting spatial correlation lengths and slopes of the correlation function of
different subsamples are compared to previous studies. Results. By fitting a
simple power law to the correlation function we do not see an evolution in the
correlation length and the slope from other studies at z=4 to our study at z=3.
In particular, the dependence of the slope on UV-luminosity similar to that
recently detected for a sample of B-dropouts is confirmed also for our
U-dropouts. For the first time number statistics for U-dropouts are sufficient
to clearly detect a departure from a pure power law on small scales down to ~2""
reported by other groups for B-dropouts.",2006-06-23T07:08:19Z
Elementary Physics in the Cellular Automaton Universe,"General relativity is a mathematical model that uses sophisticated geometry
to describe simple physics. It agrees with experiment in the few tests that can
be made, but the whole edifice is not physics. Instead of using observations to
test that model, I derive a simple empirical model of elementary physics and
cosmology from the observations. The observations imply that the universe is a
finite cellular automaton; that there is no curved space; that fundamental
particles are massless; that ""massy"" particles, including electrons, are
composed of fundamental particles; that gravitational mass is inertial mass;
that black holes are made from neutrons compressed into bosons; that the
universe was produced from cold compressed particles, not radiation; and that
the universe is not expanding.",2006-05-18T19:24:50Z
Detecting dark matter in electromagnetic field penetration experiments,"Dark matter in the form of particles from a hidden mirror sector has recently
been proposed as an explanation for the DAMA annual modulation signal. Here one
assumes that there exists a small mixing between photons and mirror photons. We
show that dark matter with this property can also be detected in
electromagnetic field penetration experiments. Such experiments can be used to
measure the speed and direction of the dark matter halo wind, the local
density, the temperature, and the strength of the photon-mirror photon mixing
interaction. An additional result would be a significant improvement of the
upper limit on the photon mass.",2006-05-15T20:00:37Z
The Large-Scale Structure view on the Galaxy-Quasar-AGN connection,"Combined investigations of the clustering properties of galaxies of different
spectral type and high-redshift quasars strongly suggest local ellipticals to
be the parent population of optically bright Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).
However, the picture gets more blurred when one extends the analysis to that
class of AGNs which show enhanced radio emission. Objects belonging to this
class in fact are found to be associated with structures which are about an
order of magnitude more massive than those that host radio-quiet AGNs. Also,
masses for the black holes engines of radio-enhanced AGN emission turn out to
be systematically higher than those which fuel 'normal' quasars. On the other
hand, the level of radio-activity in radio-luminous objects does not seem to be
connected with black hole/host galaxy mass, at variance with what found in the
optical case. These results, together with evidences for different cosmological
evolutions of different types of AGNs pose a serious challenge to all those
models aiming at providing a unified picture for black hole-powered sources.",2006-05-31T20:38:45Z
A Century of Cosmology,"In the century since Einstein's anno mirabilis of 1905, our concept of the
Universe has expanded from Kapteyn's flattened disk of stars only 10 kpc across
to an observed horizon about 30 Gpc across that is only a tiny fraction of an
immensely large inflated bubble. The expansion of our knowledge about the
Universe, both in the types of data and the sheer quantity of data, has been
just as dramatic. This talk will summarize this century of progress and our
current understanding of the cosmos.",2006-03-28T05:55:12Z
"20-100 keV properties of cataclysmic variables detected in the
  INTEGRAL/IBIS survey","Analysis of INTEGRAL/IBIS survey observations has revealed that the rare
intermediate polar and asynchronous polar cataclysmic variables are
consistently found to emit in the 20-100 keV energy band, whereas synchronous
polars and the common non-magnetic CVs rarely do so. From the correlation of a
candidate INTEGRAL/IBIS survey source list with a CV catalogue, 15 CV
detections by IBIS have been established including a new INTEGRAL source IGR
J06253+7334. The properties of these sources and 4 additional CV candidates are
discussed in the context of their 20-100 keV emission characteristics and we
conclude that the INTEGRAL mission is an important tool in the detection of new
magnetic CV systems. Furthermore, analysis of the time-averaged spectra of CVs
detected by INTEGRAL indicate that although there is little difference between
the spectral slopes of the different sub-types, intermediate polars may be
considerably more luminous than polars in the soft gamma-ray regime. We also
present the detection of an unusual high-energy burst from V1223 Sgr discovered
by inspection of the IBIS light-curve. Additionally, we have compared the IBIS
and optical AAVSO light-curves of SS Cyg and extracted IBIS spectra during
single periods of optical outburst and quiescence. We find that the 20-100 keV
flux is an order of magnitude greater during optical quiescence. This is in
agreement with previous studies which show that the hard X-ray component of SS
Cyg is suppressed during high accretion states",2006-07-20T13:07:02Z
GRB 060313: A New Paradigm for Short-Hard Bursts?,"We report the simultaneous observations of the prompt emission in the
gamma-ray and hard X-ray bands by the Swift-BAT and the KONUS-Wind instruments
of the short-hard burst, GRB 060313. The observations reveal multiple peaks in
both the gamma-ray and hard X-ray bands suggesting a highly variable outflow
from the central explosion. We also describe the early-time observations of the
X-ray and UV/Optical afterglows by the Swift XRT and UVOT instruments. The
combination of the X-ray and UV/Optical observations provide the most
comprehensive lightcurves to date of a short-hard burst at such an early epoch.
The afterglows exhibit complex structure with different decay indices and
flaring. This behavior can be explained by the combination of a structured jet,
radiative loss of energy, and decreasing microphysics parameters occurring in a
circum-burst medium with densities varying by a factor of approximately two on
a length scale of 10^17 cm. These density variations are normally associated
with the environment of a massive star and inhomogeneities in its windy medium.
However, the mean density of the observed medium (n approximately 10^&#8722;4
cm^3) is much less than that expected for a massive star. Although the collapse
of a massive star as the origin of GRB 060313 is unlikely, the merger of a
compact binary also poses problems for explaining the behavior of this burst.
Two possible suggestions for explaining this scenario are: some short bursts
may arise from a mechanism that does not invoke the conventional compact binary
model, or soft late-time central engine activity is producing UV/optical but no
X-ray flaring.",2006-04-28T21:23:57Z
"Cosmological and Astrophysical Parameter Measurements with 21-cm
  Anisotropies During the Era of Reionization","We study the prospects for extracting cosmological and astrophysical
parameters from the low radio frequency 21-cm background due to the spin-flip
transition of neutral Hydrogen during and prior to the reionization of the
Universe. We make use of the angular power spectrum of 21-cm anisotropies,
which exists due to inhomogeneities in the neutral Hydrogen density field, the
gas temperature field, the gas velocity field, and the spatial distribution of
the Lyman-$\alpha$ intensity field associated with first luminous sources that
emit UV photons. We extract parameters that describe both the underlying mass
power spectrum and the global cosmology, as well as a set of simplified
astrophysical parameters that connect fluctuations in the dark matter to those
that govern 21-cm fluctuations. We also marginalize over a model for the
foregrounds at low radio frequencies. In this general description, we find
large degeneracies between cosmological parameters and the astrophysical
parameters, though such degeneracies are reduced when strong assumptions are
made with respect to the spin temperature relative to the CMB temperature or
when complicated sources of anisotropy in the brightness temperature are
ignored. Some of the degeneracies between cosmological and astrophysical
parameters are broken when 21-cm anisotropy measurements are combined with
information from the CMB, such as the temperature and the polarization
measurements with Planck. While the overall improvement on the cosmological
parameter estimates is not significant when measurements from first-generation
interferometers are combined with Planck, such a combination can measure
astrophysical parameters such as the ionization fraction in several redshift
bins with reasonable accuracy.",2006-05-26T20:06:31Z
"The Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer Survey of OVI Emission in the
  Milky Way","We present a survey of OVI 1032 emission in the Milky Way using data from the
Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) satellite. The observations span
the period from launch in 1999 to July 2003. Our survey contains 112 sight
lines, 23 of which show measurable OVI 1032 emission. The OVI 1032 emission
feature was detected at all latitudes and exhibits intensities of 1900-8600
photons/s/cm^2/sr. Combined with values from the literature, these emission
measurements are consistent with the picture derived from recent OVI absorption
surveys: high-latitude sight lines probe OVI-emitting gas in a clumpy, thick
disk or halo, while low-latitude sight lines sample mixing layers and
interfaces in the thin disk of the Galaxy.",2006-05-05T18:29:10Z
"Simulations and Analytic Calculations of Bubble Growth During Hydrogen
  Reionization","We present results from a large volume simulation of Hydrogen reionization.
We combine 3d radiative transfer calculations and an N-body simulation,
describing structure formation in the intergalactic medium, to detail the
growth of HII regions around high redshift galaxies. Our simulation tracks
1024^3 dark matter particles, in a box of co-moving side length 65.6 Mpc/h.
This large volume allows us to accurately characterize the size distribution of
HII regions throughout most of the reionization process. At the same time, our
simulation resolves many of the small galaxies likely responsible for
reionization. It confirms a picture anticipated by analytic models: HII regions
grow collectively around highly-clustered sources, and have a well-defined
characteristic size, which evolves from a sub-Mpc scale at the beginning of
reionization to R > 10 Mpc towards the end. We present a detailed statistical
description of our results, and compare them with a numerical scheme based on
the analytic model by Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga, and Hernquist. We find that the
analytic calculation reproduces the size distribution of HII regions and the 21
cm power spectrum of the radiative transfer simulation remarkably well. The
ionization field from the simulation, however, has more small scale structure
than the analytic calculation, owing to Poisson scatter in the simulated
abundance of galaxies on small scales. We propose and validate a simple scheme
to incorporate this scatter into our calculations. Our results suggest that
analytic calculations are sufficiently accurate to aid in predicting and
interpreting the results of future 21 cm surveys. In particular, our fast
numerical scheme is useful for forecasting constraints from future 21 cm
surveys, and in constructing mock surveys to test data analysis procedures.",2006-04-11T20:00:26Z
Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy of Disks around Classical T Tauri Stars,"We present the first Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS; The IRS was a
collaborative venture between Cornell University and Ball Aerospace Corporation
funded by NASA through the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Ames Research
Center.) observations of the disks around classical T Tauri stars: spectra in
the 5.2-30 micron range of six stars. The spectra are dominated by emission
features from amorphous silicate dust, and a continuous component from 5 to 8
microns that in most cases comprises an excess above the photosphere throughout
our spectral range. There is considerable variation in the silicate
feature/continuum ratio, which implies variations of inclination, disk flaring,
and stellar mass accretion rate. In most of our stars, structure in the
silicate feature suggests the presence of a crystalline component. In one, CoKu
Tau/4, no excess above the photosphere appears at wavelengths shortward of the
silicate features, similar to 10 Myr old TW Hya, Hen 3-600, and HR 4796A. This
indicates the optically thick inner disk is largely absent. The silicate
emission features with peaks at 9.7 and 18 microns indicate small dust grains
are present. The extremely low 10-20 micron color temperature of the dust
excess, 135 K, indicates these grains are located more than 10 AU from the
star. These features are suggestive of gravitational influence by planets or
close stellar companions and grain growth in the region within 10 AU of the
star, somewhat surprising for a star this young (1 Myr).",2006-05-18T16:59:02Z
"Limits on the Transient Ultra-High Energy Neutrino Flux from Gamma-Ray
  Bursts (GRB) Derived from RICE Data","We present limits on ultra-high energy (UHE; E(nu)>1 PeV) neutrino fluxes
from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), based on recently presented data, limits, and
simulations from the RICE experiment. We use data from five recorded transients
with sufficient photon spectral shape and redshift information to derive an
expected neutrino flux, assuming that the observed photons are linked to
neutrino production through pion decay via the well-known 'Waxman-Bahcall'
prescription. Knowing the declination of the observed burst, as well as the
RICE sensitivity as a function of polar angle and the previously published
non-observation of any neutrino events allows an estimate of the sensitivity to
a given neutrino flux. Although several orders of magnitude weaker than the
expected fluxes, our GRB neutrino flux limits are nevertheless the first in the
PeV--EeV energy regime. For completeness, we also provide a listing of other
bursts, recorded at times when the RICE experiment was active, but requiring
some assumptions regarding luminosity and redshift to permit estimates of the
neutrino flux.",2006-05-19T15:15:59Z
"The Advantage of Increased Resolution in the Study of Quasar Absorption
  Systems","We compare a new R = 120,000 spectrum of PG1634+706 (z_QSO = 1.337,m_V =
14.9) obtained with the HDS instrument on Subaru to a R = 45, 000 spectrum
obtained previously with HIRES/Keck. In the strong MgII system at z = 0.9902
and the multiple cloud, weak MgII system at z = 1.0414, we find that at the
higher resolution, additional components are resolved in a blended profile. We
find that two single-cloud weak MgII absorbers were already resolved at R =
45,000, to have b = 2 - 4 km/s. The narrowest line that we measure in the R =
120, 000 spectrum is a component of the Galactic NaI absorption, with b =
0.90+/-0.20 km/s. We discuss expectations of similarly narrow lines in various
applications, including studies of DLAs, the MgI phases of strong MgII
absorbers, and high velocity clouds. By applying Voigt profile fitting to
synthetic lines, we compare the consistency with which line profile parameters
can be accurately recovered at R = 45,000 and R = 120,000. We estimate the
improvement gained from superhigh resolution in resolving narrowly separated
velocity components in absorption profiles. We also explore the influence of
isotope line shifts and hyperfine splitting in measurements of line profile
parameters, and the spectral resolution needed to identify these effects. Super
high resolution spectra of quasars, which will be routinely possible with
20-meter class telescopes, will lead to greater sensitivity for absorption line
surveys, and to determination of more accurate physical conditions for cold
phases of gas in various environments.",2006-08-04T17:23:56Z
"The Origin Magnetars: the role of anisotropic neutron superfluid of
  neutron stars","We estimate the strength of the induced magnetic field due to the total
induced magnetic moment of the anisotropic ($^3PF^2$) neutron superfluid
interior of neutron stars. The induced magnetic field of the neutron stars is
found as follows. $B^{(in)} = \frac{\eta}{{T_7 - \eta}}B^{(0)}
,\begin{array}{*{20}c}{} & {\eta =} \ \end{array}\frac{{m(^3 P_2
)}}{{0.1m_{Sun}}}R_{NS,6}^{- 3} $ ($T_7$ denotes the interior temperature of
the neutron star in unit of 10$^7$ K). The induced magnetic field will
gradually increase with the temperature of the neutron star decreasing in their
late evolutionary stage. A magnetar may appear in a condition when $T_7 \to
\eta$. The upper limit of the induced magnetic field of $^3P^2$ superfluid is
$3.35 \time 10^{14} \eta$.",2006-07-11T07:48:26Z
"Can MOND take a bullet? Analytical comparisons of three versions of MOND
  beyond spherical symmetry","A proper test of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) in systems of non-trivial
geometries depends on modelling subtle differences in several versions of its
postulated theories. This is especially important for lensing and dynamics of
barely virialised galaxy clusters with typical gravity of scale $\sim a_0 \sim
1\AA{\rm s}^{-2}$. The original MOND formula, the classical single field
modification of the Poisson equation, and the multi-field general relativistic
theory of Bekenstein (TeVeS) all lead to different predictions as we stray from
spherical symmetry. In this paper, we study a class of analytical MONDian
models for a system with a semi-Hernquist baryonic profile. After presenting
the analytical distribution function of the baryons in spherical limits, we
develop orbits and gravitational lensing of the models in non-spherical
geometries. In particular, we can generate a multi-centred baryonic system with
a weak lensing signal resembling that of the merging galaxy cluster 1E 0657-56
with a bullet-like light distribution. We finally present analytical scale-free
highly non-spherical models to show the subtle differences between the single
field classical MOND theory and the multi-field TeVeS theory.",2006-06-09T14:48:15Z
Dust in starburst nuclei and ULIRGs: SED models for observers,"We provide a library of some 7000 SEDs (available at www.eso.org/~rsiebenm)
for the nuclei of starburst and ultra luminous galaxies. Its purpose is to
quickly obtain estimates of the basic parameters, such as luminosity, size and
dust or gas mass and to predict the flux at yet unobserved wavelengths. The
procedure is simple and consists of finding an element in the library that
matches the observations. The objects may be in the local universe or at high
z.
  We calculate the radiative transfer in spherical symmetry for a stellar
cluster permeated by an interstellar medium with standard (Milky Way) dust
properties. The cluster contains two stellar populations: old bulge stars and
OB stars. Because the latter are young, a certain fraction of them will be
embedded in compact clouds which constitute hot spots that determine the MIR
fluxes.
  We present SEDs for a broad range of luminosities, sizes and obscurations. We
argue that the assumption of spherical symmetry and the neglect of clumpiness
of the medium are not severe shortcomings for computing the dust emission. The
validity of the approach is demonstrated by matching the SED of seven of the
best studied galaxies, including M82 and Arp220, by library elements. In all
cases, one finds an element which fits the observed SED very well, and the
parameters defining the element are in full accord with what is known about the
galaxy from detailed studies. We also compare our method of computing SEDs with
other techniques described in the literature.",2006-06-19T12:39:56Z
How Well Can Weak Lensing Measure the Mass of Galaxy Clusters?,"The technique of weak-lensing aperture mass densitometry, so called the
zeta-statistic, has recently been popular in actual observations for
measurement of individual cluster mass. It has however been anticipated that
the line-of-sight projection by foreground and background matter can adversely
affect the cluster mass determination with not only substantial error
dispersion but also a sizable positive systematic bias. Additionally, the
finite number of background galaxies even at a reasonable observing depth can
also introduce Poisson noise to the mass estimate. In this paper, we
quantitatively investigate the degree of errors separately contributed by the
two sources to the mass determination of those galaxy clusters with
M_{200}>10^{14}M_{\odot}. We find that the aperture mass of zeta-statistic
turns out to be a mass estimator of much reduced systematic bias, due to the
cancellation by the positively biased local background mass sheet. However, the
error dispersion of M_{200} arising from both projection effect and Poisson
noise is found to be still sizable (40%-90%), even for the shear-selected,
clean sample where multiple clusters located within a suitable projected
aperture are removed. We also investigate how to remedy this large-error
problem in weak lensing measurements, and propose a plausible alternative mass
estimator, M(<theta_{1000}), an aperture mass measured within about half the
virial radius. The aperture mass M(<theta_{1000}) is free of bias and has a
substantially reduced error dispersion, 39% for the worst case of high-z,
low-mass clusters, that can be smaller than the error dispersion of M_{200} as
much as a factor 3.",2006-07-24T16:22:43Z
A Universe Dominated by Dilaton Field,"Using a single dilaton field, a unified model of the Universe is proposed,
which evolves from the radiation-like dominance in the Big Bang, to the
dark-matter-like dominance in the early Universe, to the coexistence of both
dark-matter-like and dark energy today, and finally to the dark energy
dominance in the infinite future. This model is consistent with current results
on the age of the Universe, the transition redshift from deceleration to
acceleration, BBN and evolution of dark energy. Future higher quality data may
constrain the cosmic evolution of dark matter, dark energy and Hubble constant
more precisely and make critical tests on our model predictions.",2006-05-26T23:58:12Z
"The Optimum Distance at which to Determine the Size of a Giant Air
  Shower","To determine the size of an extensive air shower it is not necessary to have
knowledge of the function that describes the fall-off of signal size from the
shower core (the lateral distribution function). In this paper an analysis with
a simple Monte Carlo model is used to show that an optimum ground parameter can
be identified for each individual shower. At this optimal core distance,
$r_\mathrm{opt}$, the fluctuations in the expected signal, $S(r_\mathrm{opt})$,
due to a lack of knowledge of the lateral distribution function are minimised.
Furthermore it is shown that the optimum ground parameter is determined
primarily by the array geometry, with little dependence on the energy or zenith
angle of the shower or choice of lateral distribution function. For an array
such as the Pierre Auger Southern Observatory, with detectors separated by 1500
m in a triangular configuration, the optimum distance at which to measure this
characteristic signal is close to 1000 m.",2006-08-04T16:44:51Z
Galactic Warps Induced By Cosmic Infall,"Recent ideas for the origin and persistence of the warps commonly observed in
disc galaxies have focused on cosmic infall. We present N-body simulations of
an idealized form of cosmic infall onto a disc galaxy and obtain a warp that
closely resembles those observed. The inner disc tilts remarkably rigidly,
indicating strong cohesion due to self-gravity. The line of nodes of the warp
inside $R_{26.5} ~ 4.5 \Rd$ is straight, while that beyond $R_{26.5}$ generally
forms a loosely-wound, leading spiral in agreement with Briggs's rules. We
focus on the mechanism of the warp and show that the leading spiral arises from
the torques from the misaligned inner disc and its associated inner oblate
halo. The fact that the line of nodes of most warps forms a leading spiral
might imply that the disc mass is significant in the centre. If the line of
nodes can be traced to very large radii in future observations, it may reveal
information on the mass distribution of the outer halo. The warp is not
strongly damped by the halo because the precession rate of the inner disc is
slow and the inner halo generally remains aligned with the inner disc. Thus
even after the imposed quadrupolar perturbation is removed, the warp persists
for a few Gyrs, by which time another infall event can be expected.",2006-04-25T20:01:08Z
"Grain Alignment, Polarization and Magnetic Fields","Aligned non-spherical dust particles polarize starlight passing through the
dust cloud. They also emit polarized far infrared and sub-mm radiation.
Substantial progress in understanding of grain alignment theory makes the
interpretation of the polarized radiation in terms of underlying magnetic
fields much more reliable. I discuss a number of fundamental processes that
affect grain alignment. In particular, I shall discuss how subtle effects
related to nuclear spins of the atoms alter the dynamics of dust grains. I
shall discuss how the theory explains the existing observational data and
demonstrate when the polarization can and cannot be interpreted in terms of the
underlying magnetic fields.",2006-08-02T03:21:05Z
"High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of the Narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy
  NGC 4051 with Chandra LETGS","We study the absorption and emission properties of the photoionised gas near
one of the brightest and most variable AGN, the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4051, in
order to constrain the geometry, dynamics and ionisation structure of the
outflow. We analyse two observations taken with the Low Energy Transmission
Grating Spectrometer (LETGS) of Chandra. We study the spectra of both
observations and investigate the spectral response to a sudden, long-lasting
flux decrease of a factor of 5 that occurred during the second observation. We
confirm the preliminary detection of a highly ionised component with an outflow
velocity of -4500 km/s, one of the highest velocity outflow components seen in
a Seyfert 1 galaxy. The sudden drop in intensity by a factor of five during the
second observation causes a drop in ionisation parameter of a similar magnitude
in the strongest and main ionisation component (v = -610 km/s), allowing us for
the first time to determine the recombination time of this component and
thereby its distance in a robust way. We find an upper limit to the distance of
10^15 m, ruling out an origin in the narrow emission line region. In addition,
an emission component producing strong radiative recombination continua of C VI
and C V appears during the low state. This can be explained by emission from an
ionised skin of the accretion disk at a distance of only ~4x10^12 m from the
black hole. Finally, the spectra contain a broad relativistic O VIII line with
properties similar to what was found before in this source with XMM-Newton;
this line has disappeared during the low flux state, consistent with the
disappearance of the inner part of the accretion disk during that low flux
state. (abridged)",2006-06-01T08:50:38Z
A periodically active pulsar giving insight into magnetospheric physics,"PSR B1931+24 (J1933+2421) behaves as an ordinary isolated radio pulsar during
active phases that are 5-10 days long. However, the radio emission switches off
in less than 10 seconds and remains undetectable for the next 25-35 days, then
it switches on again. This pattern repeats quasi-periodically. The origin of
this behaviour is unclear. Even more remarkably, the pulsar rotation slows down
50% faster when it is on than when it is off. This indicates a massive increase
in magnetospheric currents when the pulsar switches on, proving that pulsar
wind plays a substantial role in pulsar spin-down. This allows us, for the
first time, to estimate the currents in a pulsar magnetospheric during the
occurrence of radio emission.",2006-04-28T11:26:30Z
Delayed X- and Gamma-Ray Line Emission from Solar Flare Radioactivity,"We have studied the radioactive line emission expected from solar active
regions after large flares, following the production of long-lived
radioisotopes by nuclear interactions of flare-accelerated ions. This delayed
X- and gamma-ray line emission can provide unique information on the
accelerated particle composition and energy spectrum, as well as on mixing
processes in the solar atmosphere. Total cross sections for the formation of
the main radioisotopes by proton, 3-He and alpha-particle reactions are
evaluated from available data combined with nuclear reaction theory.
Thick-target radioisotope yields are provided in tabular form, which can be
used to predict fluxes of all of the major delayed lines at any time after a
gamma-ray flare. The brightest delayed line for days after the flare is found
to be the 511 keV positron-electron annihilation line resulting from the decay
of several beta+ radioisotopes. After ~2 days however, the flux of the 511 keV
line can become lower than that of the 846.8 keV line from the decay of 56-Co.
Our study has revealed other delayed gamma-ray lines that appear to be
promising for detection, e.g. at 1434 keV from the radioactivity of both the
isomer and the ground state of 52-Mn, 1332 and 1792 keV from 60-Cu, and 931.1
keV from 55-Co. The strongest delayed X-ray line is found to be the Co Kalpha
at 6.92 keV, which is produced from both the decay of the isomer of 58-Co by
the conversion of a K-shell electron and the decay of 57-Ni by orbital electron
capture. Prospects for observation of these lines with RHESSI or future space
instruments are discussed.",2006-04-14T09:14:38Z
"Lensing signals in the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field using all 2nd order shape
  deformations","The long exposure times of the HST Ultra-Deep Field plus the use of an
empirically derived position-dependent PSF, have enabled us to measure a
cardioid/displacement distortion map coefficient as well as improving upon the
sextupole map coefficient. We confirmed that curved background galaxies are
clumped on the same angular scale as found in the HST Deep Field North. The new
cardioid/displacement map coefficient is strongly correlated to a product of
the sextupole and quadrupole coefficients. One would expect to see such a
correlation from fits to background galaxies with quadrupole and sextupole
moments. Events that depart from this correlation are expected to arise from
map coefficient changes due to lensing, and several galaxy subsets selected
using this criteria are indeed clumped.",2006-07-02T04:51:19Z
Unveiling supergiant fast X-ray transient sources with INTEGRAL,"Supergiant high mass X-ray binaries (SGXBs) are believed to be rare objects,
as stars in the supergiant phase have a very short lifetime and to date only
about a dozen of them have been discovered. They are known to be persistent and
bright X-ray sources. INTEGRAL is changing this classical picture as its
observations are revealing the presence of a new subclass of SGXBs which have
been labelled as supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXTs) as they are strongly
characterized by fast X-ray outbursts lasting less than a day, typically a few
hours. We report on IBIS detections of newly discovered fast X-ray outbursts
from 10 sources, four of which have been recently optically identified as
supergiant high mass X-ray binaries. In particular for one of them, IGR
J11215-5952, we observe fast X-ray transient behaviour for the first time. The
remaining six sources (IGR J16479-4514, IGR J16418-4532, XTE J1743-363, IGR
J16195-4945=AX J161929-4945, AX J1749.1-2733, IGR J17407-2808) are still
unclassified, however they can be considered as candidate SFXTs because of
their similarity to the known SFXTs.",2006-03-28T10:38:19Z
Star formation in the vicinity of the IC 348 cluster,"Aims. We present molecular line observations of the southwestern part of the
IC 348 young cluster, and we use them together with NIR and mm continuum data
to determine the distribution of dense gas, search for molecular outflows, and
analyze the ongoing star formation activity in the region. Methods. Our
molecular line data consists of C18O(1--0) and N2H+(1--0) maps obtained with
the FCRAO telescope at a resolution of about 50'' and CO(2--1) data obtained
with the IRAM 30m telescope at a resolution of 11''. Results. The dense gas
southwest of IC 348 is concentrated in two groups of dense cores, each of them
with a few solar masses of material and indications of CO depletion at high
density. One of the core groups is actively forming stars, while the other
seems starless. There is evidence for at least three bipolar molecular outflows
in the region, two of them powered by previously identified Class 0 sources,
while the other one is powered by a still not well characterized low-luminosity
object. The ongoing star formation activity is producing a small stellar
subgroup in the cluster. Using the observed core characteristics and the star
formation rate in the cluster we propose that that similar episodes of stellar
birth may have produced the subclustering observed in the halo of IC 348.",2006-06-15T20:04:47Z
Fine structure in the gamma-ray sky,"The EGRET results for gamma-ray intensities in and near the Galactic Plane
have been analysed in some detail. Attention has been concentrated on energies
above 1 GeV and the individual intensities in a $4^\circ$ longitude bin have
been determined and compared with the large scale mean found from a nine-degree
polynomial fit.
  Comparison has been made of the observed standard deviation for the ratio of
these intensities with that expected from variants of our model. The basic
model adopts cosmic ray origin from supernova remnants, the particles then
diffusing through the Galaxy with our usual 'anomalous diffusion'. The variants
involve the clustering of SN, a frequency distribution for supernova explosion
energies, and 'normal', rather than 'anomalous' diffusion.
  It is found that for supernovae of unique energy, and our usual anomalous
diffusion, clustering is necessary, particularly in the Inner Galaxy. An
alternative, and preferred, situation is to adopt the model with a frequency
distribution of supernova energies. The results for the Outer Galaxy are such
that no clustering is required.",2006-05-17T12:58:16Z
"Cosmic Evolution of Mass Accretion Rate and Metalicity in Active
  Galactic Nuclei","We present line and continuum measurements for 9818 SDSS type-I active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) with z le 0.75. The data are used to study the four
dimensional space of black hole mass, normalized accretion rate (Ledd),
metalicity and redshift. The main results are: 1. Ledd is smaller for larger
mass black holes at all redshifts. 2. For a given black hole mass Ledd propto
z^gamma or (1+z)^delta where the slope gamma increases with black hole mass.
The mean slope is similar to the star formation rate slope over the same
redshift interval. 3. The FeII/Hb line ratio is significantly correlated with
Ledd. It also shows a weaker negative dependence on redshift. Combined with the
known dependence of metalicity on accretion rate, we suggest that the FeII/Hb
line ratio is a metalicity indicator. 4. Given the measured accretion rates,
the growth times of most AGNs exceed the age of the universe. This suggests
past episodes of faster growth for all those sources. Combined with the FeII/Hb
result, we conclude that the broad emission lines metalicity goes through
cycles and is not a monotonously decreasing function of redshift. 5. FWHM(OIII)
is a poor proxy of sigma_* especially for high Ledd. 6. We define a group of
narrow line type-I AGNs (NLAGN1s) by their luminosity (or mass) dependent Hb
line width. Such objects have Ledd>0.25 and they comprise 8% of the type-I
population. Other interesting results include negative Baldwin relationships
for EW(Hb) and EW(FeII) and a relative increase of the red part of the Hb line
with luminosity.",2006-07-28T18:49:34Z
On the investigations of galaxy redshift periodicity,"In this article we present a historical review of study of the redshift
periodicity of galaxies, starting from the first works performed in the
seventies of the twentieth century until the present day. We discuss the
observational data and methods used, showing in which cases the discretization
of redshifts was observed. We conclude that galaxy redshift periodisation is an
effect which can really exist. We also discussed the redshift discretization in
two different structures: the Local Group of galaxies and the Hercules
Supercluster. Contrary to the previous studies we consider all galaxies which
can be regarded as a structure member disregarding the accuracy of velocity
measurements. We applied the power spectrum analysis using the Hann function
for weighting, together with the jackknife error estimator. In both the
structures we found weak effects of redshift periodisation.",2006-06-13T06:50:28Z
"SINFONI adaptive optics integral field spectroscopy of the Circinus
  Galaxy","Aims. To investigate the star formation activity and the gas and stellar
dynamics on scales of a few parsecs in the nucleus of the Circinus Galaxy.
Methods.Using the adaptive optics near infrared integral field spectrometer
SINFONI on the VLT, we have obtained observations of the Circinus galaxy on
scales of a few parsecs and at a spectral resolution of 70 km s^{-1} FWHM. The
physical properties of the nucleus are analyzed by means of line and velocity
maps extracted from the SINFONI datacube. Starburst models are constrained
using the Br-gamma flux, stellar continuum (as traced via the CO absorption
bandheads longward of 2.3um), and radio continuum. Results. The similarity of
the morphologies of the H_2 (1-0)S(1) 2.12um and Br-gamma 2.17um lines to the
stellar continuum and also their kinematics, suggest a common origin in star
formation. Within 8 pc of the AGN we find there has been a recent starburst in
the last 100 Myr, which currently accounts for 1.4% of the galaxy's bolometric
luminosity. The similarity of the spatial scales over which the stars and gas
exist indicates that this star formation is occuring within the torus; and
comparison of the gas column density through the torus to the maximum possible
optical depth to the stars implies the torus is a clumpy medium. The coronal
lines show asymmetric profiles with a spatially compact narrow component and a
spatially extended blue wing. These characteristics are consistent with some of
the emission arising in clouds gravitationally bound to the AGN, and some
outflowing in cloudlets which have been eroded away from the bound clouds.",2006-04-13T19:33:17Z
The large-scale jet-powered radio nebula of Circinus X-1,"We present multi-epoch observations of the radio nebula around the neutron
star X-ray binary Circinus X-1 made at 1.4 and 2.5 GHz with the Australia
Telescope Compact Array between October 2000 and September 2004. The nebula can
be seen as a result of the interaction between the jet from the system and the
interstellar medium and it is likely that we are actually looking toward the
central X-ray binary system through the jet-powered radio lobe. The study of
the nebula thus offers a unique opportunity to estimate for the first time
using calorimetry the energetics of a jet from an object clearly identified as
a neutron star. An extensive discussion on the energetics of the complex is
presented: a first approach is based on the minimum energy estimation, while a
second one employs a self-similar model of the interaction between the jets and
the surrounding medium. The results suggest an age for the nebula of \leq 10^5
years and a corresponding time-averaged jet power \geq 10^{35} erg s^{-1}.
During periodic flaring episodes, the instantaneous jet power may reach values
of similar magnitude to the X-ray luminosity.",2006-07-27T12:35:17Z
"Constraints on the mass of a habitable planet with water of nebular
  origin","From an astrobiological point of view, special attention has been paid to the
probability of habitable planets in extrasolar systems. The purpose of this
study is to constrain a possible range of the mass of a terrestrial planet that
can get water. We focus on the process of water production through oxidation of
the atmospheric hydrogen--the nebular gas having been attracted
gravitationally--by oxide available at the planetary surface. For the water
production to work well on a planet, a sufficient amount of hydrogen and enough
high temperature to melt the planetary surface are needed. We have simulated
the structure of the atmosphere that connects with the protoplanetary nebula
for wide ranges of heat flux, opacity, and density of the nebular gas. We have
found both requirements are fulfilled for an Earth-mass planet for wide ranges
of the parameters. We have also found the surface temperature of planets of <=
0.3 Earth masses is lower than the melting temperature of silicate (~ 1500K).
On the other hand, a planet of more than several Earth masses becomes a gas
giant planet through runaway accretion of the nebular gas.",2006-06-06T13:30:16Z
"First results from SAPAC: towards a 3D-picture of the Fornax cluster
  core","A sophisticated SBF analysis package has been developed, designed to measure
distances of early-type galaxies by means of surface brightness fluctuations of
unresolved stars. This suite of programs called SAPAC is made readily available
to the astronomical community for extensive testing with the long-term goal to
provide the necessary tools for systematic distance surveys of early-type
galaxies using modern optical/NIR telescopes equipped with wide-field cameras.
We discuss the technical and scientific concepts of SAPAC and demonstrate its
capabilities by analysing deep B and R-band CCD images of 10 dwarf elliptical
(dE) galaxy candidates in the Fornax cluster obtained with FORS1 at the VLT.
All candidates are confirmed as cluster members. We then turn our attention to
the innermost region of the Fornax cluster. A total of 29 early-type galaxies
closer than three cluster core radii (2 degrees) from the central galaxy
NGC1399 have radial velocities and SBF distances. Their Hubble diagram exhibits
a pronounced S-shaped infall pattern suggesting a picture that Fornax is still
in the process of formation during the present epoch through a general collapse
and possible accretion of distinct groups of galaxies. The associated collapse
time is 2.9(+1.6, -0.9)Gyr. After cleansing our galaxy sample from a few
kinematical outliers the true distance of the Fornax cluster core is determined
at 20.13+-0.40 Mpc [(m-M)_0=31.51+-0.04mag]. Applying a bootstrap resampling
technique on the distance distribution with individual distance errors taken
into account further reveals a small intrinsic cluster depth of
sigma_int=0.74(+0.52,-0.74)Mpc in best agreement with the cluster's linear
extension in the sky: sigma_R.A=sigma_DEC~=0.5Mpc. (Abridged)",2006-06-07T02:23:26Z
"A multi-object, multi-field spectrometer and imager for a European ELT","One of the highlights of the European ELT Science Case book is the study of
resolved stellar populations, potentially out to the Virgo Cluster of galaxies.
A European ELT would enable such studies in a wide range of unexplored distant
environments, in terms of both galaxy morphology and metallicity. As part of a
small study, a revised science case has been used to shape the conceptual
design of a multi-object, multi-field spectrometer and imager (MOMSI). Here we
present an overview of some key science drivers, and how to achieve these with
elements such as multiplex, AO-correction, pick-off technology and spectral
resolution.",2006-05-19T07:11:04Z
Photometric study of selected cataclysmic variables,"We present time-resolved photometry of five relatively poorly-studied
cataclysmic variables: V1193 Ori, LQ Peg, LD 317, V795 Her, and MCT 2347-3144.
The observations were made using four 1m-class telescopes for a total of more
than 250 h of observation and almost 16,000 data points. For LQ Peg WHT
spectroscopic data have been analysed as well.
  The light curves show a wide range of variability on different time scales
from minutes to months. We detect for the first time a brightness variation of
0.05 mag in amplitude in V1193 Ori on the same timescale as the orbital period,
which we interpret as the result of the irradiation of the secondary. A 20-min
quasi-periodic oscillation is also detected. The mean brightness of the system
has changed by 0.5 mag on a three-month interval, while the flickering was
halved. In LQ Peg a 0.05 mag modulation was revealed with a period of about 3
h. The flickering was much smaller, of the order of 0.025 mag. A possible
quasi-periodic oscillation could exist near 30 min. For this object, the WHT
spectra are single-peaked and do not show any radial-velocity variations. The
data of LD 317 show a decrease in the mean magnitude of the system. No periodic
signal was detected but this is certainly attributable to the very large
flickering observed: between 0.07 and 0.1 mag. For V795 Her, the 2.8-hour
modulation, thought to be a superhump arising from the precession of the disc,
is present. We show that this modulation is not stable in terms of periodicity,
amplitude, and phase. Finally, for MCT 2347-3144, a clear modulation is seen in
a first dataset obtained in October 2002. This modulation is absent in August
2003, when the system was brighter and showed much more flickering.",2006-05-05T16:35:26Z
"GaBoDS: The Garching-Bonn Deep Survey -- IX. A sample of 158
  shear-selected mass concentration candidates","The aim of the present work is the construction of a mass-selected galaxy
cluster sample based on weak gravitational lensing methods. This sample will be
subject to spectroscopic follow-up observations.
  We apply the mass aperture statistics and a derivative of it to 19 square
degrees of high quality, single colour wide field imaging data obtained with
the WFI@MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope. For the statistics a family of filter functions
is used that approximates the expected tangential radial shear profile and thus
allows for the efficient detection of mass concentrations.
  We identify 158 possible mass concentrations. This is the first time that
such a large and blindly selected sample is published. 72 of the detections are
associated with concentrations of bright galaxies. For about 22 of those we
found spectra in the literature, indicating or proving that the galaxies seen
are indeed spatially concentrated. 15 of those were previously known to be
clusters or have meanwhile been secured as such. We currently follow-up a
larger number of them spectroscopically to obtain deeper insight into their
physical properties. The remaining 55% of the possible mass concentrations
found are not associated with any optical light, or could not be classified
unambiguously. We show that those ""dark"" detections are to a significant degree
due to noise, and appear preferentially in shallow data.",2006-07-03T13:42:47Z
The Type Ia Supernova Rate at z ~0.5 from the Supernova Legacy Survey,"We present a measurement of the distant Type Ia supernova rate derived from
the first two years of the Canada -- France -- Hawaii Telescope Supernova
Legacy Survey. We observed four one-square degree fields with a typical
temporal frequency of <Delta t> ~ 4 observer-frame days over time spans of from
158 to 211 days per season for each field, with breaks during full moon. We
used 8-10 meter-class telescopes for spectroscopic followup to confirm our
candidates and determine their redshifts. Our starting sample consists of 73
spectroscopically verified Type Ia supernovae in the redshift range 0.2 < z <
0.6. We derive a volumetric SN Ia rate of r_V(<z>=0.47) = 0.42^{+0.13}_{-0.09}
(systematic) +- 0.06 (statistical) X 10^-4 yr^-1 Mpc^3, assuming h = 0.7,
Omega_m = 0.3 and a flat cosmology. Using recently published galaxy luminosity
functions derived in our redshift range, we derive a SN Ia rate per unit
luminosity of r_L(<z>=0.47) = 0.154^{+0.048}_{-0.033} (systematic)
^{+0.039}_{-0.031} (statistical) SNu. Using our rate alone, we place an upper
limit on the component of SN Ia production that tracks the cosmic star
formation history of 1 SN Ia per 10^3 M_sun of stars formed. Our rate and other
rates from surveys using spectroscopic sample confirmation display only a
modest evolution out to z=0.55.",2006-05-05T05:11:40Z
Black Hole Censorship of Varying Fundamental Constants,"Here it is shown that the variation in the fine structure constant measured
by Webb et al. matches the theoretically derived value for the maximum
variation in the electronic charge permitted by the Generalized Second Law of

independently or dependently, vary at the maximal rate allowed by the
Generalized Second Law of Thermodynamics.",2006-04-04T22:59:18Z
"Interaction of massive black hole binaries with their stellar
  environment: I. Ejection of hypervelocity stars","We use full three-body scattering experiments to study the ejection of
hypervelocity stars (HVSs) by massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) at the center
of galaxies. Ambient stars drawn from a Maxwellian distribution unbound to the
binary are expelled by the gravitational slingshot. Accurate measurements of
thermally averaged hardening, mass ejection, and eccentricity growth rates (H,
J, and K) for MBHBs in a fixed stellar background are obtained by numerical
orbit integration from initial conditions determined by Monte Carlo techniques.
Three-body interactions create a subpopulation of HVSs on nearly radial,
corotating orbits, with a spatial distribution that is initially highly
flattened in the inspiral plane of the MBHB, but becomes more isotropic with
decreasing binary separation. The degree of anisotropy is smaller for unequal
mass binaries and larger for stars with higher kick velocities. Eccentric MBHBs
produce a more prominent tail of high-velocity stars and break planar symmetry,
ejecting HVSs along a broad jet perpendicular to the semimajor axis. The jet
two-sidedness decreases with increasing binary mass ratio, while the jet
opening-angle increases with decreasing kick velocity and orbital separation.
The detection of a numerous population of HVSs in the halo of the Milky Way by
the next generation of large astrometric surveys like GAIA may provide a unique
signature of the history, nature, and environment of the MBH at the Galactic
center.",2006-04-13T12:57:00Z
"Competition between dust scattering albedo and 2175 A bump for
  ultraviolet colours of nearby disc galaxies","Observed ultraviolet (UV) colours of nearby disc galaxies show a reddening
relative to their expected intrinsic colours. Since the 2175 \AA bump found in
the Milky Way's dust extinction law blues the UV colours, it might suggest that
dust in nearby disc galaxies does not have the bump and that the Milky Way is
exceptional. However, this conclusion can be modified by the effect of
scatterings. If the scattering albedo decreases towards shorter wavelengths,
observable UV colours redden. An extensive comparison between observed UV
colours and those expected from radiative transfer simulations shows two types
of dust suitable for nearby disc galaxies: (1) dust with a bump and a smaller
albedo for a shorter wavelength (except for the bump range), and (2) dust
without any bump but with an almost constant albedo. If very small carbonaceous
grains responsible for the common unidentified infrared emission band are also
the bump carrier, the former dust is favorable.",2006-05-06T06:58:29Z
Willman 1 - A Galactic Satellite at 40 kpc With Multiple Stellar Tails,"SDSSJ1049+5103, commonly known as Willman 1, is an extremely low-luminosity
Milky Way companion whose properties are intermediate between those of globular
clusters and dwarf spheroidals. In this paper, we use deep photometry to show
that this object is old and moderately metal-poor, has a distance of 38 +/- 7
kpc, has an M_V of -2.5 mag, and has a half-light radius of 21 +/- 7 pc,
consistent with previous estimates. The spatial distribution of Willman 1's
main sequence stars shows 1) its total spatial extent exceeds its tidal radius
for a range of assumptions about its total mass and its orbit and 2) the
presence of prominent multi-directional stellar tails. The tidal interactions
causing these tail features may explain the large physical size of Willman 1
relative to low-luminosity globular clusters. It is the most distant Galactic
object yet known to display prominent tails, and is the only distant satellite
to display multi-directional tails. Although we cannot at present determine the
cause of this unusual morphology, preliminary comparisons between the
morphology of Willman 1 and published simulations suggest that it may be near
the apocenter of its orbit, or that it may have interacted with another halo
object. We find a significant difference between the luminosity functions of
stars in the center and in the tails of Willman 1, strongly suggesting mass
segregation much like that seen in Palomar 5. Although Willman 1 has more
pronounced tidal tails than most confirmed Milky Way dwarf galaxies, because of
its very low stellar mass we cannot at present rule out the possibility that it
has a dark matter halo. (Abridged)",2006-03-17T21:01:25Z
"Parametric modelling of the 3.6um to 8um colour distributions of
  galaxies in the SWIRE Survey","We fit a parametric model comprising a mixture of multi-dimensional Gaussian
functions to the 3.6 to 8um colour and optical photo-z distribution of galaxy
populations in the ELAIS-N1 and Lockman Fields of SWIRE. For 16,698 sources in
ELAIS-N1 we find our data are best modelled (in the sense of the Bayesian
Information Criterion) by the sum of four Gaussian distributions or modes (C_a,
C_b, C_c and C_d). We compare the fit of our empirical model with predictions
from existing semi-analytic and phenomological models. We infer that our
empirical model provides a better description of the mid-infrared colour
distribution of the SWIRE survey than these existing models. This colour
distribution test is thus a powerful model discriminator and complementary to
comparisons of number counts. We use our model to provide a galaxy
classification scheme and explore the nature of the galaxies in the different
modes of the model. C_a consists of dusty star-forming systems such as ULIRG's.
Low redshift late-type spirals are found in C_b, where PAH emission dominates
at 8um. C_c consists of dusty starburst systems at intermediate redshifts. Low
redshift early-type spirals and ellipticals dominate C_d. We thus find a
greater variety of galaxy types than one can with optical photometry alone.
Finally we develop a new technique to identify unusual objects, and find a
selection of outliers with very red IRAC colours. These objects are not
detected in the optical, but have very strong detections in the mid-infrared.
These sources are modelled as dust-enshrouded, strongly obscured AGN, where the
high mid-infrared emission may either be attributed to dust heated by the AGN
or substantial star-formation. These sources have z_ph ~ 2-4, making them
incredibly infrared luminous, with a L_IR ~ 10^(12.6-14.1) L_sun.",2006-04-20T14:16:51Z
Overcoming the Rayleigh Criterion Limit with Optical Vortices,"We experimentally and numerically tested the separability of two independent
equally-luminous monochromatic and white light sources at the diffraction
limit, using Optical Vortices (OV), related to the Orbital Angular Momentum
(OAM) of light. The diffraction pattern of one of the two sources crosses a
phase modifying device (fork-hologram) on its center generating the
Laguerre-Gaussian (L-G) transform of an Airy disk. The second source, crossing
the fork-hologram in positions different from the optical center, acquires
different OAM values and generates non-symmetric L-G patterns. We formulated a
criterion, based on the asymmetric intensity distribution of the superposed L-G
patterns so created, to resolve the two sources at angular distances much below
the Rayleigh criterion. Analogous experiments carried out in white light allow
angular resolutions which are still one order of magnitude below the Rayleigh
criterion. The use OVs might offer new applications for stellar separation in
future space experiments.",2006-06-08T15:04:15Z
The X-ray properties of the magnetic Cataclysmic Variable UU Col,"XMM-Newton observations aimed at determining for the first time the
broad-band X-ray properties of the faint high galactic latitude Intermediate
Polar UU Col are presented. We performed X-ray timing analysis in different
energy ranges of the EPIC cameras which reveals the dominance of the 863s white
dwarf rotational period. The spin pulse is strongly energy dependent. Weak
variabilities at the beat 935s and at the 3.5hr orbital periods are also
observed, but the orbital modulation is detected only below 0.5keV.
Simultaneous UV and optical photometry shows that the spin pulse is anti-phased
with respect to the hard X-rays. Analysis of the EPIC and RGS spectra reveals
the complexity of the X-ray emission, being composed of a soft 50eV black--body
component and two optically thin emission components at 0.2keV and 11keV
strongly absorbed by dense material with an equivalent hydrogen column density
of 10**(23)cm**(-2) partially (50%) covering the X-ray source. The complex
X-ray and UV/optical temporal behaviour indicates that accretion occurs
predominantly (80%) via a disc with a partial contribution (20%) directly from
the stream. The main accreting pole dominates at high energies whilst the
secondary pole mainly contributes in the soft X-rays and at lower energies. The
bolometric flux ratio of the soft-to-hard X-ray emissions is found to be
consistent with the prediction of the standard accretion shock model. We find
the white dwarf in UU Col accretes at a low rate and possesses a low magnetic
moment. It is therefore unlikely that UU Col will evolve into a moderate field
strength Polar, which leaves the soft X-ray Intermediate Polars a still
enigmatic small group of magnetic Cataclysmic Variables.",2006-03-14T14:21:09Z
"Spitzer/MIPS Imaging of NGC 650: Probing the History of Mass Loss on the
  Asymptotic Giant Branch","We present the far-infrared (IR) maps of a bipolar planetary nebula (PN), NGC
650, at 24, 70, and 160 micron taken with the Multiband Imaging Photometer for
Spitzer (MIPS) on-board the Spitzer Space Telescope. While the two-peak
emission structure seen in all MIPS bands suggests the presence of a near
edge-on dusty torus, the distinct emission structure between the 24 micron map
and the 70/160 micron maps indicates the presence of two distinct emission
components in the central torus. Based on the spatial correlation of these two
far-IR emission components with respect to various optical line emission, we
conclude that the 24 micron emission is largely due to the [O IV] line at 25.9
micron arising from highly ionized regions behind the ionization front, whereas
the 70 and 160 micron emission is due to dust continuum arising from
low-temperature dust in the remnant asymptotic giant branch (AGB) wind shell.
The far-IR nebula structure also suggests that the enhancement of mass loss at
the end of the AGB phase has occurred isotropically, but has ensued only in the
equatorial directions while ceasing in the polar directions. The present data
also show evidence for the prolate spheroidal distribution of matter in this
bipolar PN. The AGB mass loss history reconstructed in this PN is thus
consistent with what has been previously proposed based on the past optical and
mid-IR imaging surveys of the post-AGB shells.",2006-06-21T19:58:21Z
"Star formation rates and chemical abundances of emission line galaxies
  in intermediate-redshift clusters","We examine the evolutionary status of luminous, star-forming galaxies in
intermediate-redshift clusters by considering their star formation rates and
the chemical and ionsiation properties of their interstellar emitting gas. Our
sample consists of 17 massive, star-forming, mostly disk galaxies with
M_{B}<-20, in clusters with redshifts in the range 0.31< z <0.59, with a median
of <z>=0.42. We compare these galaxies with the identically selected and
analysed intermediate-redshift field sample of Mouhcine et al. (2006), and with
local galaxies from the Nearby Field Galaxy Survey of Jansen et al. (2000).
  From our optical spectra we measure the equivalent widths of OII, Hbeta and
OIII emission lines to determine diagnostic line ratios, oxygen abundances, and
extinction-corrected star formation rates. The star-forming galaxies in
intermediate-redshift clusters display emission line equivalent widths which
are, on average, significantly smaller than measured for field galaxies at
comparable redshifts. However, a contrasting fraction of our cluster galaxies
have equivalent widths similar to the highest observed in the field. This
tentatively suggests a bimodality in the star-formation rates per unit
luminosity for galaxies in distant clusters. We find no evidence for further
bimodalities, or differences between our cluster and field samples, when
examining additional diagnostics and the oxygen abundances of our galaxies.
This maybe because no such differences exist, perhaps because the cluster
galaxies which still display signs of star-formation have recently arrived from
the field. In order to examine this topic with more certainty, and to further
investigate the way in which any disparity varies as a function of cluster
properties, larger spectroscopic samples are needed.",2006-03-23T15:04:28Z
Nucleosynthesis: Stellar and Solar Abundances and Atomic Data,"Abundance observations indicate the presence of often surprisingly large
amounts of neutron capture (i.e., s- and r-process) elements in old Galactic
halo and globular cluster stars. These observations provide insight into the
nature of the earliest generations of stars in the Galaxy -- the progenitors of
the halo stars -- responsible for neutron-capture synthesis. Comparisons of
abundance trends can be used to understand the chemical evolution of the Galaxy
and the nature of heavy element nucleosynthesis. In addition age
determinations, based upon long-lived radioactive nuclei abundances, can now be
obtained. These stellar abundance determinations depend critically upon atomic
data. Improved laboratory transition probabilities have been recently obtained
for a number of elements. These new gf values have been used to greatly refine
the abundances of neutron-capture elemental abundances in the solar photosphere
and in very metal-poor Galactic halo stars. The newly determined stellar
abundances are surprisingly consistent with a (relative) Solar System r-process
pattern, and are also consistent with abundance predictions expected from such
neutron-capture nucleosynthesis.",2006-05-04T20:15:06Z
Simulations of globular clusters merging in galactic nuclear regions,"We present the results of detailed N-body simulations regarding the
interaction of four massive globular clusters in the central region of a
triaxial galaxy. The systems undergo a full merging event, producing a sort of
'Super Star Cluster' (SSC) whose features are close to those of a superposition
of the individual initial mergers. In contrast with other similar simulations,
the resulting SSC structural parameters are located along the observed scaling
relations of globular clusters. These findings seem to support the idea that a
massive SSC may have formed in early phases of the mother galaxy evolution and
contributed to the growth of a massive nucleus.",2006-04-29T10:25:37Z
Canals in Milky Way radio polarization maps,"Narrow depolarized canals are common in maps of the polarized synchrotron
emission of the Milky Way. Two physical effects that can produce these canals
have been identified: the presence of Faraday rotation measure ($\RM$)
gradients in a foreground screen and the cumulative cancellation of
polarization known as differential Faraday rotation. We show that the behaviour
of the Stokes parameters $Q$ and $U$ in the vicinity of a canal can be used to
identify its origin. In the case of canals produced by a Faraday screen we
demonstrate that, if the polarization angle changes by $90\degr$ across the
canal, as is observed in all fields to-date, the gradients in $\RM$ must be
discontinuous. Shocks are an obvious source of such discontinuities and we
derive a relation of the expected mean separation of canals to the abundance
and Mach number of supernova driven shocks, and compare this with recent
observations by \citet{Haverkorn03}. We also predict the existence of less
common canals with polarization angle changes other than $90\degr$.
Differential Faraday rotation can produce canals in a uniform magneto-ionic
medium, but as the emitting layer becomes less uniform the canals will
disappear. We show that for moderate differences in emissivity in a two-layer
medium, of up to 1/2, and for Faraday depth fluctuations of standard deviation
$\lesssim 1 \mathrm{rad}$, canals produced by differential rotation will still
be visible.",2006-07-03T15:34:55Z
"Extracting first science measurements from the southern detector of the
  Pierre Auger observatory","The world's largest cosmic-ray detector is nearing completion in the remote
Pampas of Argentina. This instrument measures extensive air-showers with
energies from ${10^{18}-10^{20}}$ eV and beyond. A surface detector array of
area 3000 ${km^2}$ records the lateral distribution of charged particles at
ground level. A fluorescence detector overlooking the surface detector records
the longitudinal light profiles of showers in the atmosphere to make a
calorimetric energy measurement. A ``test beam'' for the fluorescence detector

the northern hemisphere will also be outlined.",2006-07-19T19:22:47Z
The Central Regions of M31 in the 3 - 5 micron Wavelength Region,"Images obtained with NIRI on the Gemini North telescope are used to
investigate the photometric properties of the central regions of M31 in the 3 -
5 micron wavelength range. The light distribution in the central arcsecond
differs from what is seen in the near-infrared in the sense that the difference
in peak brigh tness between P1 and P2 is larger in M' than in K'; no obvious
signature of P3 is dete cted in M'. These results can be explained if there is
a source of emission that contributes ~ 20% of the peak M' light of P1 and has
an effective temperature of no more than a few hundred K that is located
between P1 and P2. Based on the red K-M' color of this source, it is suggested
that the emission originates in a circumstellar dust shell surrounding a single
bright AGB star. A similar bright source that is ~ 8 arcsec from the center of
the galaxy is also detected in M'. Finally, the (L', K-L') color-magnitude
diagram of unblended stars shows a domin ant AGB population with photometric
characteristics that are similar to those of the most luminous M giants in the
Galactic bulge.",2006-04-28T21:43:18Z

Stochastic wake field particle acceleration in Gamma-Ray Bursts,"Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) prompt emission can, for specific conditions, be so
powerful and short-pulsed to strongly influence any surrounding plasma. In this
paper, we briefly discuss the possibility that a very intense initial burst of
radiation produced by GRBs satisfy the intensity and temporal conditions to
cause stochastic wake-field particle acceleration in a surrounding plasma of
moderate density. Recent laboratory experiments clearly indicate that powerful
laser beam pulses of tens of femtosecond duration hitting on target plasmas
cause efficient particle acceleration and betatron radiation up to tens of MeV.
We consider a simple but realistic GRB model for which particle wake-field
acceleration can first be excited by a very strong low-energy precursor, and
then be effective in producing the observed prompt X-ray and gamma-ray GRB
emission. We also briefly discuss some of the consequences of this novel GRB
emission mechanism.",2006-04-11T10:24:53Z
"What triggers galaxy transformations? The environments of post-starburst
  galaxies","(abridged) There are good observational reasons to believe that the
progenitors of red galaxies have undergone starbursts, followed by a
post-starburst phase. We investigate the environments of post-starburst
galaxies by measuring \textsl{(1)} number densities in $8 h^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}$
radius comoving spheres, \textsl{(2)} transverse distances to nearest
Virgo-like galaxy clusters, and \textsl{(3)} transverse distances to nearest
luminous-galaxy neighbors. We compare the post-starburst galaxies to currently
star-forming galaxies identified solely by A-star excess or $\Halpha$ emission.
We find that post-starburst galaxies are in the same kinds of environments as
star-forming galaxies; this is our ``null hypothesis''. More importantly, we
find that at each value of the A-star excess, the star-forming and
post-starburst galaxies lie in very similar distributions of environment. The
only deviations from our null hypothesis are barely significant: a slight
deficit of post-starburst galaxies (relative to the star-forming population) in
very low-density regions, a small excess inside the virial radii of clusters,
and a slight excess with nearby neighbors. None of these effects is strong
enough to make the post-starburst galaxies a high-density phenomenon, or to
argue that the starburst events are primarily triggered by external tidal
impulses (e.g., from close passages of massive galaxies). The small excess
inside cluster virial radii suggests that some post-starbursts are triggered by
interactions with the intracluster medium, but this represents a very small
fraction of all post-starburst galaxies.",2006-06-23T19:55:00Z
"Analysis of 26 Barium Stars II. Contributions of s-, r- and p-processes
  in the production of heavy elements","Barium stars show enhanced abundances of the slow neutron capture (s-process)
heavy elements, and for this reason they are suitable objects for the study of
s-process elements. The aim of this work is to quantify the contributions of
the s-, r- and p-processes for the total abundance of heavy elements from
abundances derived for a sample of 26 barium stars. The abundance ratios
between these processes and neutron exposures were studied. The abundances of
the sample stars were compared to those of normal stars thus identifying the
fraction relative to the s-process main component. The fittings of the sigmaN
curves (neutron capture cross section times abundance, plotted against atomic
mass number) for the sample stars suggest that the material from the companion
asymptotic giant branch star had approximately the solar isotopic composition
as concerns fractions of abundances relative to the s-process main component.
The abundance ratios of heavy elements, hs, ls and s and the computed neutron
exposure are similar to those of post-AGB stars. For some sample stars, an
exponential neutron exposure fits well the observed data, whereas for others, a
single neutron exposure provides a better fit. The comparison between barium
and AGB stars supports the hypothesis of binarity for the barium star
formation. Abundances of r-elements that are part of the s-process path in
barium stars are usually higher than those in normal stars,and for this reason,
barium stars seemed to be also enriched in r-elements, although in a lower
degree than s-elements. No dependence on luminosity classes was found in the
abundance ratios behaviour among the dwarfs and giants of the sample barium
stars.",2006-04-04T14:39:49Z
"Early structure formation in quintessence models and its implications
  for cosmic reionisation from first stars","We present the first hydrodynamic N-body simulations of primordial gas clouds
responsible for the reionisation process in dark energy cosmologies. We compare
the cosmological constant scenario with a SUGRA quintessence model with marked
dynamics in order to highlight effects due to the different acceleration
histories imposed by the dark energy. We show that both the number density of
gas clouds and their clumpiness keep a record of the expansion rate during
evolution, similar to the non-linear dark matter profile at virialisation, as
was recently demonstrated by Dolag et al. (2004). Varying the shape of the
primordial power spectrum, we show how this effect is mitigated by a running
spectral index decreasing the power at small scales. Our results demonstrate
that, in order to constrain the dark energy from large scale structures, one
must track its effects down to the distribution of luminous matter.",2006-07-18T10:37:14Z
Power-laws and Non-Power-laws in Dark Matter Halos,"Simulated dark matter profiles are often modelled as a `NFW' density profile
rather than a single power law. Recently, attention has turned to the rather
rigorous power-law behaviour exhibited by the `pseudo phase-space density' of
the dark matter halo, which is defined dimensionally in terms of the local
density and velocity dispersion of the dark matter particles. The non-power-law
behaviour of the density profile is generally taken to exclude simple
scale-free, in-fall models; however the power-law behaviour of the
`pseudo-density' is a counter indication. We argue in this paper that both
behaviours may be at least qualitatively understood in terms of a dynamically
evolving self-similarity, rather than the form for self-similar infall that is
fixed by cosmological initial conditions. The evolution is likely due to
collective relaxation such as that provided by the radial-orbit instability on
large scales. We deduce, from a distribution function given by first order
coarse-graining, both the NFW-type density profile and the power-law
pseudo-density profile. The results are not greatly sensitive to variation
about 3 in the power of the velocity dispersion used in the definition of the
phase space pseudo-density. We suggest that the power 2 may create the more
physical quantity, whose deviations from a power-law are a diagnostic of
incomplete relaxation.",2006-06-27T12:54:26Z
Classicality of the primordial perturbations,"We show that during inflation, a quantum fluctuation becomes classical at all

"Cosmological Simulations of Intergalactic Medium Enrichment from
  Galactic Outflows","We investigate models of self-consistent chemical enrichment of the
intergalactic medium (IGM) from z=6 to 1.5, based on hydrodynamic simulations
of structure formation that incorporate galactic outflows. Our main result is
that outflow parameterizations based on momentum-driven winds as seen in local
starburst galaxies provide the best agreement with observations of CIV
absorption at z~2-5. Such models sufficiently enrich the high-z IGM to produce
a global mass density of CIV absorbers that is relatively invariant from z=5.5
to 1.5, in agreement with observations. This occurs despite an increase in the
volume-averaged metallicity by x5-10 over this redshift range, because energy
input from outflows causes a drop in the global ionization fraction of CIV.
Comparisons to observed CIV column density and linewidth distributions and
CIV-based pixel optical depth ratios provide significant constraints on wind
models. Our best-fitting models show mean IGM temperatures only slightly above
our no-outflow case, metal filling factors of just a few % with volume-weighted
metallicities around 0.001 at z~3, significant amounts of collisionally-ionized
CIV absorption, and a metallicity-density relationship that rises rapidly at
low overdensities and flattens at higher ones. In general, we find that outflow
speeds must be high enough to enrich the low-density IGM at early times but low
enough not to overheat it, and concurrently must significantly suppress early
star formation while still producing enough early metals. It is therefore
non-trivial that locally-calibrated momentum-driven wind scenarios naturally
yield the desired strength and evolution of outflows, and suggest that such
models represent a significant step towards understanding the impact of
galactic outflows on galaxies and the IGM across cosmic time.",2006-05-25T19:44:35Z
AL 3 (BH 261): a new globular cluster in the Galaxy,"AL~3 (BH 261), previously classified as a faint open cluster candidate, is
shown to be a new globular cluster in the Milky Way, by means of B, V and I
Color-Magnitude Diagrams. The main feature of AL~3 is a prominent blue extended
Horizontal Branch. Its Color-Magnitude Diagrams match those of the intermediate
metallicity cluster M~5. The cluster is projected in a rich bulge field, also
contaminated by the disk main sequence. The globular cluster is located in the
Galactic bulge at a distance from the Sun d$_{\odot}$ = 6.0$\pm$0.5 kpc. The
reddening is E(B-V)=0.36$\pm$0.03 and the metallicity is estimated to be [Fe/H]
$\approx$ -1.3$\pm$0.25. AL~3 is probably one of the least massive globular
clusters of the Galaxy.",2006-06-29T12:33:57Z
"Mapping Large-Scale Gaseous Outflows in Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies
  with Keck II ESI Spectra: Spatial Extent of the Outflow","The kinematics of neutral gas and warm ionized gas have been mapped in
one-dimension across ultraluminous starburst galaxies using interstellar
absorption and emission lines, in Keck II ESI spectra. Blue-shifted absorption
is found along more of the slit than anticipated, exceeding scales of 15 kpc
across several systems. The large velocity gradient measured across some of
these outflows is inconsistent with a flow diverging from the central starburst
-- angular momentum conservation reduces the rotational velocity of an outflow
as it expands. More widespread star formation, likely triggered by the merger,
probably drives these outflows, although some models suggest the collision
itself could generate a wind by shock heating interstellar gas throughout the
disk. Young mergers with separated nuclei present the highest outflow masses,
due mainly to the larger area over which the cool gas can be detected. In a
typical ULIG, the mass carried by the cool phase of the outflow is around
10^8Msun, or a few percent of the total dynamical mass. Assuming the starburst
activity has proceeded at the observed rate for the past 10 Myr, the kinetic
energy of the cool outflows is a few percent of the supernova energy,
consistent with starbursts powering the outflows. The cool wind is expected to
be accelerated by momentum deposition, possibly from radiation pressure as well
as supernovae. Such models imply turn-around radii for the cool outflows of at
least 30 to 90 kpc. This cross-section presents a significant NaI absorption
cross section. If most L > 0.1L* galaxies pass through a luminous starburst
phase, then relics of cool outflows will create a significant redshift-path
density. Galaxy formation models should include this cool phase of the outflow
in addition to a hot wind in feedback models.",2006-04-07T19:28:39Z
Magnetic fields and UV-line variability in $β$ Cephei,"We present results of numerical simulations of wind variability in the

the observed UV wind line profiles.",2006-03-16T11:02:46Z
"Precise Radial Velocities of Giant Stars II. Pollux and its Planetary
  Companion","It has long been speculated that the observed periodic radial velocity
pattern for the K giant Pollux might be explained in terms of an orbiting
planetary companion. We have collected 80 high-resolution spectra for Pollux at
Lick Observatory yielding precise radial velocities with a mean error of 3.8
m/s, providing the most comprehensive and precise data set available for this
star. Our data confirm the periodicity previously seen in the radial
velocities. We derive a period of 589.7+/-3.5 days and, assuming a primary mass
of 1.86 M_Sun, a minimum companion mass of 2.9+/-0.3 M_Jup, consistent with
earlier determinations. No evidence for any periodicities is visible in our
analysis of the shapes of the spectral lines via the bisector method, so that
we conclude that evidence is accumulating and compelling for a planet around
Pollux. However, some last doubt remains about this interpretation, because
non-radial pulsations which might be present in giant stars could in principle
also explain the observed radial velocities, while the accompanying bisector
variations might be too small to be detectable with current data.",2006-07-07T13:51:22Z
"Cloudy_3D, a new pseudo-3D photoionization code","We developed a new quick pseudo-3D photoionization code based on Cloudy (G.
Ferland) and IDL (RSI) tools. The code is running the 1D photoionization code
Cloudy various times, changing at each run the input parameters (e.g. inner
radius, density law) according to an angular law describing the morphology of
the object. Then a cube is generated by interpolating the outputs of Cloudy. In
each cell of the cube, the physical conditions (electron temperature and
density, ionic fractions) and the emissivities of lines are determined.
Associated tools (VISNEB and VELNEB_3D) are used to rotate the nebula and to
compute surface brightness maps and emission line profiles, given a velocity
law and taking into account the effect of the thermal broadening and eventually
the turbulence. Integrated emission line profiles are computed, given aperture
shapes and positions (seeing and instrumental width effects are included). The
main advantage of this tool is the short time needed to compute a model (a few
tens minutes).",2006-05-16T20:21:10Z

"Beyond the bubble catastrophe of Type Ia supernovae: Pulsating Reverse
  Detonation models","We describe a mechanism by which a failed deflagration of a
Chandrasekhar-mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf can turn into a successful
thermonuclear supernova explosion, without invoking an ad hoc high-density
deflagration-detonation transition. Following a pulsating phase, an accretion
shock develops above a core of 1 M_sun composed of carbon and oxygen, inducing
a converging detonation. A three-dimensional simulation of the explosion
produced a kinetic energy of 1.05E51 ergs and 0.70 M_sun of 56Ni, ejecting
scarcely 0.01 M_sun of C-O moving at low velocities. The mechanism works under
quite general conditions and is flexible enough to account for the diversity of
normal Type Ia supernovae. In given conditions the detonation might not occur,
which would reflect in peculiar signatures in the gamma and UV-wavelengths",2006-04-03T12:56:56Z

lower energy band (<0.3 MeV). Excellent energy resolution is the key feature of
the SGD, allowing it to achieve both high angular resolution and good
background rejection capability. An additional capability of the SGD, its
ability to measure gamma-ray polarization, opens up a new window to study
properties of astronomical objects. We will present the development of key
technologies to realize the SGD: high quality CdTe, low noise front-end ASIC
and bump bonding technology. Energy resolutions of 1.7 keV (FWHM) for CdTe
pixel detectors and 1.1 keV for Si strip detectors have been measured. We also
present the validation of Monte Carlo simulation used to evaluate the
performance of the SGD.",2006-04-17T22:53:37Z
High Resolution Simulations of Supersonic Turbulence in Molecular Clouds,"We present the results of three-dimensional simulations of supersonic Euler
turbulence with grid resolutions up to 1024^3 points. Our numerical experiments
describe nonmagnetized driven turbulent flows with an isothermal equation of
state and an rms Mach number of 6. We demonstrate that the inertial range
scaling properties of turbulence in this strongly compressible regime deviate
substantially from a Kolmogorov-like behavior previously recovered for mildly
compressible transonic flows.",2006-07-28T20:40:50Z
"X-ray emission from the double neutron star binary B1534+12: Powered by
  the pulsar wind?","We report the detection of the double neutron star binary (DNSB) B1534+12 (=
J1537+1155) with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. This DNSB (orbital period 10.1
hr) consists of the millisecond (recycled) pulsar J1537+1155A (P_A=37.9 ms) and
a neutron star not detected in the radio. After the remarkable double pulsar
binary J0737-3039, it is the only other DNSB detected in X-rays. We measured
the flux of (2.2\pm 0.6)\times10^{-15} ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2} in the 0.3-6 keV
band. The small number of collected counts allows only crude estimates of
spectral parameters. The power-law fit yields the photon index of 3.2\pm 0.5
and the unabsorbed 0.2-10 keV luminosity L_X=6\times10^{29} ergs s^{-1} =
3\times 10^{-4}Edot_A, where Edot_A is the spin-down power of J1537+1155A.
Alternatively, the spectrum can be fitted by a blackbody model with T = 2.2 MK
and the projected emitting area of ~ 5\times 10^3 m^2. The distribution of
photon arrival times over binary orbital phase shows a deficit of X-ray
emission around apastron, which suggests that the emission is caused by
interaction of the relativistic wind from J1537+1155A with its neutron star
companion. We also reanalyzed the Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of
J0737-3039 and found that its X-ray spectrum is similar to the spectrum of
B1534+12, and its X-ray luminosity is about the same fraction of Edot_A, which
suggests similar X-ray emission mechanisms. However, the X-ray emission from
J0737-3039 does not show orbital phase dependence. This difference can be
explained by the smaller eccentricity of J0737-3039 or a smaller misalignment
between the equatorial plane of the millisecond pulsar and the orbital plane of
the binary.",2006-03-31T15:54:24Z
"The Spin-Resolved Atomic Velocity Distribution and 21-cm Line Profile of
  Dark-Age Gas","The 21-cm hyperfine line of atomic hydrogen (HI) is a promising probe of the
cosmic dark ages. In past treatments of 21-cm radiation it was assumed the
hyperfine level populations of HI could be characterized by a
velocity-independent ``spin temperature'' T_s determined by a competition
between 21-cm radiative transitions, spin-changing collisions, and (at lower
redshifts) Lyman-alpha scattering. However we show here that, if the
collisional time is comparable to the radiative time, the spin temperature will
depend on atomic velocity, T_s=T_s(v), and one must replace the usual hyperfine
level rate equations with a Boltzmann equation describing the spin and velocity
dependence of the HI distribution function. We construct here the Boltzmann
equation relevant to the cosmic dark ages and solve it using a basis-function
method. Accounting for the actual spin-resolved atomic velocity distribution
results in up to a 2 per cent suppression of the 21-cm emissivity, and a
redshift and angular-projection dependent suppression or enhancement of the
linear power spectrum of 21-cm fluctuations of up to 5 per cent. The effect on
the 21-cm line profile is more dramatic -- its full-width at half maximum
(FWHM) can be enhanced by up to 60 per cent relative to the
velocity-independent calculation. We discuss the implications for 21-cm
tomography of the dark ages.",2006-05-02T20:00:03Z
"Restframe Optical Spectroscopic Classifications for Submillimeter
  Galaxies","We report the results of a systematic near-infrared spectroscopic survey
using the Subaru, VLT and Keck Telescopes of a sample of high redshift
Ultra-luminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs) mainly composed of
submillimeter-selected galaxies. Our observations span the restframe optical
range containing nebular emission lines such as H_beta, [OIII], and [OII],
which are essential for making robust diagnostics of the physical properties of
these ULIRGs. Using the H_alpha/H_beta emission line ratios, we derive internal
extinction estimates for these galaxies similar to those of local
ULIRGs:A_v~2.9+-0.5. Correcting the H_alpha estimates of the star formation
rate for dust extinction using the Balmer decrement, results in rates which are
consistent with those estimated from the far-infrared luminosity. The majority
(>60%) of our sample show spectral features characteristic of AGN, with ~65%
exhibiting broad Balmer emission lines. A proportion of these sources show
relatively low [OIII]/H_beta line ratios, which are similar to those of Narrow
Line Seyfert 1 galaxies suggesting small mass black holes which are rapidly
growing. In the subsample of our survey with both [OIII] and hard X-ray
coverage, at least ~60% show an excess of [OIII] emission, by a factor of 5-10
times, relative to the hard X-ray luminosity compared to the correlation
between these two properties seen in Seyferts and QSOs locally. From our
spectral diagnostics, we propose that the strong [OIII] emission in these
galaxies arises from shocks in dense gaseous regions in this vigorously
star-forming population.",2006-07-26T03:11:57Z
"Discovery of a 3.6-hr Eclipsing Luminous X-Ray Binary in the Galaxy NGC
  4214","We report the discovery of an eclipsing X-ray binary with a 3.62-hr period
within 24"" of the center of the dwarf starburst galaxy NGC 4214. The orbital
period places interesting constraints on the nature of the binary, and allows
for a few very different interpretations. The most likely possibility is that
the source lies within NGC 4214 and has an X-ray luminosity of up to 7 e38
ergs/s. In this case the binary may well be comprised of a naked He-burning
donor star with a neutron-star accretor, though a stellar-mass black-hole
accretor cannot be completely excluded. There is no obvious evidence for a
strong stellar wind in the X-ray orbital light curve that would be expected
from a massive He star; thus, the mass of the He star should be <3-4 solar
masses. If correct, this would represent a new class of very luminous X-ray
binary -- perhaps related to Cyg X-3. Other less likely possibilities include a
conventional low-mass X-ray binary that somehow manages to produce such a high
X-ray luminosity and is apparently persistent over an interval of years; or a
foreground AM Her binary of much lower luminosity that fortuitously lies in the
direction of NGC 4214. Any model for this system must accommodate the lack of
an optical counterpart down to a limiting magnitude of 22.6 in the visible.",2006-04-21T14:36:19Z
"Adaptive Optics Spectroscopy of the [Fe II] Outflows from HL Tauri and
  RW Aurigae","We present new results of [Fe II] 1.644-micron spectroscopy toward the jets
from HL Tau and RW Aur carried out with the Subaru Telescope combined with the
adaptive optics system. We observed the regions within 2"" - 3"" from the stars
with the sub-arcsecond resolutions of 0.""5 and 0.""2 for HL Tau and RW Aur,
respectively. In addition to the strong, high velocity emission extended along
each jet, we detected a blueshifted low velocity emission feature seen as a
wing or shoulder of the high velocity emission at each stellar position.
Detailed analysis shows that the position-velocity diagrams (PVDs) of HL Tau
and RW Aur show a characteristic similar to those of the cold disk wind and
X-wind models in that the [Fe II] line width is broad in the vicinity of the
stellar position and is narrower at the extended jet. A closer comparison
suggests, however, that the disk wind model tends to have too large line width
at the jet while the X-wind model has excess emission on the redshifted side at
the stellar position. The narrow velocity width with symmetric line profiles of
the observed high velocity emission supports an X-wind type model where the
launching region is localized in a small radial range, while the low velocity
emission located away from the star favors the presence of a disk wind. The [Fe
II] emission from the HL Tau jet shows a gap of 0.""8 between the redshifted jet
and the star, indicating the presence of an optically thick disk of ~ 160 AU in
radius. The [Fe II] emission from the RW Aur jet shows a marked drop from the
redshifted peak at Y ~ -0.""2 toward the star, suggesting that its disk radius
is smaller than 40 AU.",2006-06-24T00:34:44Z
The 21 Centimeter Forest,"We examine the prospects for studying the pre-reionization intergalactic
medium (IGM) through the so-called 21 cm forest in spectra of bright
high-redshift radio sources. We first compute the evolution of the mean optical
depth for models that include X-ray heating of the IGM gas, Wouthuysen-Field
coupling, and reionization. Under most circumstances, the spin temperature T_S
grows large well before reionization begins in earnest. As a result, the
optical depth is less than 0.001 throughout most of reionization, and
background sources must sit well beyond the reionization surface in order to
experience measurable absorption. HII regions produce relatively large
""transmission gaps"" and may therefore still be observable during the early
stages of reionization. Absorption from sheets and filaments in the cosmic web
fades once T_S becomes large and should be rare during reionization. Minihalos
can produce strong (albeit narrow) absorption features. Measuring their
abundance would yield useful limits on the strength of feedback processes in
the IGM as well as their effect on reionization.",2006-04-10T22:25:42Z
The Planets-Capture Model of V838 Monocerotis,"The planets capture model for the eruption of V838 Mon is discussed. We used
three methods to estimate the location where the planets were consumed. There
is a nice consistency for the results of the three different methods, and we
find that the typical stopping / slowing radius for the planets is about 1Ro.
The three peaks in the optical light curve of V838 Mon are either explained by
the swallowing of three planets at different radii or by three steps in the
slowing down process of a single planet. We discuss the other models offered
for the outburst of V838 Mon, and conclude that the binary merger model and the
planet/s scenario seem to be the most promising. These two models have several
similarities, and the main differences are the stellar evolutionary stage, and
the mass of the accreted material. We show that the energy emitted in the V838
Mon event is consistent with the planets scenario. We suggest a few
explanations for the trigger for the outburst and for the double structure of
the optical peaks in the light curve of V838 Mon.",2006-06-20T21:00:05Z
Clumpy shocks and the clump mass function,"In this paper, we examine whether clumpy, colliding, flows could be
responsible for the clump mass functions that have been observed in several
regions of embedded star formation, which have been shown to be described by a
Salpeter type slope. The flows presented here, which comprise a population of
initially identical clumps and the calculations are performed with and without
the inclusion of self-gravity. When the shock region is at its densest, we find
that the clump mass spectrum is always well modelled by a Salpeter type slope.
This is true regardless of whether the self-gravity is included in the
simulations or not. In the non-self-gravitating simulations, this slope is
retained at lower Mach numbers (Mach 5 and 10) as the simulations progress past
the densest phase. In the simulations which include self-gravity, we find that
low Mach number runs yield a flatter mass function after the densest phase.
This is simply a result of increased coagulation due to gravitational collapse
of the flows. In the high Mach number runs (Mach 20) the Salpeter slope is
always lost. The self gravitating calculations also show that the sub-group of
gravitationally bound clumps in which star formation occurs, always contain the
most massive clumps in the population. The mass function of these bound star
forming clumps is not at all similar to the Salpeter type mass function
observed for stars in the field. We conclude that the clump mass function may
not only have nothing to do with gravity, but also nothing to do with the star
formation process and the resulting mass distribution of stars. This raises
doubt over the claims that the clump mass function is the origin of the stellar
IMF, for regions such as rho Oph, Serpens and the Orion B cloud.",2006-03-21T16:52:38Z
The Universal Rotation Curve of Spiral Galaxies,"The observed strong dark-to-luminous matter coupling is described by a bias
relation between visible and dark matter sources. We discuss the bias which
emerges in the case where the topological structure of the Universe at very
large distances does not match properly that of the Friedman space. With the
use of such ""topological"" bias, we construct the Universal Rotation Curve (URC)
for spirals which occurs to be in a striking agreement with the empirically
known URC. We also show that the topological bias explains the origin of the
Tully-Fisher relation ($ L\sim V^{4}$) and predicts peculiar oscillations in
the URC with a characteristic length $\sim \sqrt{L}$.",2006-04-24T17:14:50Z
The X-ray Properties of Optically-Selected Galaxy Clusters,"We stacked the X-ray data from the ROSAT All Sky Survey for over 4,000
clusters selected from the 2MASS catalog and divided into five richness
classes. We detected excess X-ray emission over background at the center of the
stacked images in all five richness bins. The interrelationships between the
mass, X-ray temperature and X-ray luminosity of the stacked clusters agree well
with those derived from catalogs of X-ray clusters. Poisson variance in the
number of galaxies occupying halos of a given mass leads to significant
differences between the average richness at fixed mass and the average mass at
fixed richness that we can model relatively easily using a simple model of the
halo occupation distribution. These statistical effects probably explain recent
results in which optically-selected clusters lie on the same X-ray
luminosity-temperature relations as local clusters but have lower optical
richnesses than observed for local clusters with the same X-ray properties.
When we further binned the clusters by redshift, we did not find significant
redshift-dependent biases in the sense that the X-ray luminosities for massive
clusters of fixed optical richness show little dependence on redshift beyond
that expected from the effects of Poisson fluctuations. Our results demonstrate
that stacking of RASS data from optically selected clusters can be a powerful
test for biases in cluster selection algorithms.",2006-05-31T20:00:16Z
Automated detection of gravitational arcs,"This paper presents a method to identify gravitational arcs or more generally
elongated structures in a given image. The method is based on the computation
of a local estimator of the elongation. The estimation of the local elongation
proceed in two steps: first the local orientation of the structure is computed,
then in the next step, a rotation is performed, and the marginal distributions
are used to compute the elongation. This procedure allows the computation of
the local elongation at each point in the image. Then, using a threshold on the
elongation map the elongated structures are identified and re-constructed using
connectivity criteria. Finally a catalogue of elongated structures is produced,
and the properties of each object are computed, allowing the selection of
potential arc candidates. The final selection of the arc candidates is
performed by visual inspection of multi-color images of a small number of
objects. This method is a general tool that may be applied not only to
gravitational arcs, but to all problems related to the mapping and measurement
of elongated structures, in an image, or a volume.",2006-06-30T16:59:46Z
Black Hole Censorship of Varying Fundamental Constants,"Here it is shown that the variation in the fine structure constant measured
by Webb et al. matches the theoretically derived value for the maximum
variation in the electronic charge permitted by the Generalized Second Law of
Thermodynamics for black holes accreting and emitting in the present cosmic
microwave background. It is postulated that the constants of nature,
independently or dependently, vary at the maximal rate allowed by the
Generalized Second Law of Thermodynamics.",2006-04-04T22:59:18Z
Dyadospheres Don't Develop,"Pair production itself prevents the development of dyadospheres, hypothetical
macroscopic regions where the electric field exceeds the critical Schwinger
value. Pair production is a self-regulating process that would discharge a
growing electric field, in the example of a hypothetical collapsing charged
stellar core, before it reached 6% of the minimum dyadosphere value, keeping
the pair production rate more than 26 orders of magnitude below the dyadosphere
value.",2006-05-18T17:39:43Z
"Laboratory Testing of a Lyot Coronagraph Equipped with an Eighth-Order
  Notch Filter Image Mask","We have built a series of notch filter image masks that make the Lyot
coronagraph less susceptible to low-spatial-frequency optical aberrations. In
this paper, we present experimental results of their performance in the lab
using monochromatic light. Our tests show that these ``eighth-order'' masks are
resistant to tilt and focus alignment errors, and can generate contrast levels
of 2 x 10^-6 at 3 lambda/D and 6 x 10^-7 at 10 lambda/D without the use of
corrective optics such as deformable mirrors. This work supports recent
theoretical studies suggesting that eighth-order masks can provide the
Terrestrial Planet Finder Coronagraph with a large search area, high off-axis
throughput, and a practical requisite pointing accuracy.",2006-04-07T15:36:49Z
Surveying the dark side,"We examine the prospects for the next generation of surveys aimed at
elucidating the nature of dark energy. We review the methods that can be used
to determine the redshift evolution of the dark energy equation of state
parameter w, highlighting their respective strengths and potential weaknesses.
All of the attractive methods require surveys covering more than 5-10,000
square degrees of the sky. We examine the accuracy that each method is likely
to deliver within a decade, and discuss the difficulties arising from
systematic uncertainties associated with the techniques.
  We conclude that the proposed photometric and redshift surveys have the
potential of delivering measurements of w with percent accuracy at several
redshifts out to z ~ 3 . Of particular interest will be the combination of weak
lensing and baryonic acoustic oscillations measurements. This exquisite
precision is likely to have a fundamental impact on our understanding of the
nature of dark energy, providing the necessary guidance for its theoretical
explanation.",2006-07-05T11:08:00Z
Diffuse Far-ultraviolet Observation of the Lupus Loop Region,"Diffuse far-ultraviolet (FUV) emissions from the Lupus Loop region (SNR
330.0+15.0) have been observed with Spectroscopy of Plasma Evolution from
Astrophysical Radiation (SPEAR), also known as Far-ultraviolet IMaging
Spectrograph (FIMS). We have detected several important ionic lines, including
Si II*, C IV, and N IV], which characterize the warm, hot ionized gas in this
region. The spatial variations in the line intensities of Si II* and C IV have
also been studied in comparison with X-ray and dust observations. The result
shows that they originate from the interface between the hot gas seen in the
X-ray and the cooler H I shell with which dust is associated. The interface is
rather diffuse, and the gases with different temperatures seem to co-exist in
this region. A shock may exist upfront in the interface, but its velocity
should be very small as no shock-related distinguished feature is seen in Ha.",2006-04-21T04:48:20Z
Supersoft X-ray Sources. Basic Parameters,"The parameters of ten supersoft X-ray sources (RX J0439.8-6809, RX
J0513.9-6951, RX J0527.8-6954, CAL 87, CAL 83, 1E 0035.4-7230, RX J0048.4-7332,
1E 0056.8-7154, RX J0019.8 +2156, RX J0925.7-4758) observed by ROSAT obtained
using blanketing LTE model atmospheres are analyzed. The consistency of the
resulting parameters with a model with stable/recurrent burning on the surface
of the white dwarf is studied. The luminosity and sizes of seven of the sources
are in good agreement with this model. The masses of the white dwarfs in these
sources are estimated. A formula that can be used to estimate the masses of
white dwarfs in classical supersoft sources based on their effective
temperatures is presented.",2006-03-16T16:48:20Z
Reconstructing the dark energy equation of state with varying couplings,"We revisit the idea of using varying couplings to probe the nature of dark
energy, in particular by reconstructing its equation of state. We show that
this method can be far superior to the standard methods (using type Ia
supernovae or weak lensing). We also show that the simultaneous use of
measurements of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and the electron-to-proton
mass ratio $\mu$ allows a direct probe of grand unification scenarios. We
present forecasts for the sensitivity of this method, both for the near future
and for the next generation of spectrographs -- for the latter we focus on the
planned CODEX instrument for ESO's Extremely Large Telescope (formerly known as
OWL). A high-accuracy reconstruction of the equation of state may be possible
all the way up to redshift $z\sim4$.",2006-05-28T21:26:53Z
"The Possibility of Cosmic Acceleration via Spatial Averaging in
  Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi Models","We investigate the possible occurrence of a positive cosmic acceleration in a
spatially averaged, expanding, unbound Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi cosmology. By
studying an approximation in which the contribution of three-curvature
dominates over the matter density, we construct numerical models which exhibit
acceleration.",2006-05-08T10:00:41Z
Rapid Formation of Super-Earths around M Dwarf Stars,"While the recent microlensing discoveries of super-Earths orbiting two M
dwarf stars have been taken as support for the core accretion mechanism of
giant planet formation, we show here that these planets could also have been
formed by the competing mechanism of disk instability, coupled with
photoevaporative loss of their gaseous envelopes by a strong external source of
UV radiation, i.e., an O star. M dwarfs that form in regions of future
high-mass star formation would then be expected to have super-Earths orbiting
at distances of several AU and beyond, while those that form in regions of
low-mass star formation would be expected to have gas giants at those
distances. Given that most stars are born in the former rather than in the
latter regions, M dwarfs should have significantly more super-Earths than gas
giants, as seems to be indicated by the microlensing surveys.",2006-05-02T17:37:07Z
The CMB polarization: status and prospects,"The study of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization is still in a
pioneering stage, but promises to bring a huge advancement in cosmology in the
near future, just as high-accuracy observations of the anisotropies in the
total intensity of the CMB revolutionized our understanding of the universe in
the past few years. In this contribution, we outline the scientific case for
observing CMB polarization, and review the current observational status and
future experimental prospects in the field.",2006-06-21T09:08:16Z
"Bright Localized Near-Infrared Emission at 1-4 AU in the AB Aurigae Disk
  Revealed by IOTA Closure Phases","We report on the detection of localized off-center emission at 1-4 AU in the
circumstellar environment of the young stellar object AB Aurigae. We used
closure phase measurements in the near-infrared made at the long baseline
interferometer IOTA, the first obtained on a young stellar object using this
technique. When probing sub-AU scales, all closure phases are close to zero
degrees, as expected given the previously-determined size of the AB Aurigae
inner dust disk. However, a clear closure phase signal of -3.5 +/- 0.5 degrees
is detected on one triangle containing relatively short baselines, requiring a
high degree of non-point symmetry from emission at larger (AU-sized) scales in
the disk. We have not identified any alternative explanation for these closure
phase results and demonstrate that a ``disk hot spot'' model can fit our data.
We speculate that such asymmetric near-infrared emission detected might arise
as a result of localized viscous heating due to a gravitational instability in
the AB Aurigae disk, or to the presence of a close stellar companion or
accreting sub-stellar object.",2006-06-02T15:58:13Z
"LIRIS multi-slit H_alpha spectroscopy of a z ~ 1 DEEP2 sample of
  star-forming galaxies","We present preliminary results of H_alpha near-infrared spectroscopy of six
galaxies with redshifts z ~ 1 drawn from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey. The
spectra have been taken with the multi-slit mode of LIRIS (Long-slit
Intermediate Resolution Infrared Spectrograph) installed at the 4.2-m William
Herschel Telescope. This is a pilot study for a larger program to obtain
H_alpha luminosities of about 50 star-forming galaxies at z ~ 1, with the aim
of deriving the corresponding star formation rates (SFRs) from H_alpha as well
as studying the relationship with other SFR indicators. The new galaxy sample
will be selected from the Extended Groth Strip Survey, where galaxies will also
have measures of stellar masses, reddening, far-IR data, and galaxy
morphologies.",2006-04-03T18:58:24Z
VW Hyi: optical spectroscopy and Doppler tomography,"We present high quality optical spectroscopy of the SU UMa-subtype dwarf
nova, VW Hyi taken while the system was in quiescence. An S-wave is executed by
the emission cores of the Hydrogen Balmer lines and by the emission lines of He
I, Ca II, Fe II and He II. Using Doppler tomography we show it originates in
the accretion stream-disc impact region. The He II emission is strongly
phase-dependent, suggesting it originates exclusively within a hot cavity at
the initial impact. We map the ionization structure of the stream-disc
interaction region. One possible interpretation of this is that the Balmer
hotspot lies downstream of the He II hotspot in the outer accretion disc, with
the He I and Ca II hotspots at intermediate locations between the two. This
suggests that Balmer emission is suppressed until material has cooled somewhat
downstream of the impact site and is able to recombine. We favour a phase
offset of 0.15+/-0.04 between the photometric ephemeris and inferior
conjunction of the mass donor. The white dwarf contributes significantly to the
optical continuum, with broad Balmer absorption and narrow Mg II 4481
absorption clearly apparent. This latter feature yields the gravitational
redshift: v_grav=38+/-21 km s^-1, so M_1=0.71+0.18-0.26 M_sun. This implies
M_2=0.11 +/- 0.03 M_sun and hence the donor is not a brown dwarf. A prominent
Balmer jump is also observed. We note that the previously accepted system
parameters for both VW Hyi and WX Hyi incoporate an algebraic error, and we
provide a recalculated M_1(q) plane for WX Hyi.",2006-03-29T18:43:44Z
"First Surface-resolved Results with the IOTA Imaging Interferometer:
  Detection of Asymmetries in AGB stars","We have measured non-zero closure phases for about 29% of our sample of 56
nearby Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars, using the 3-telescope Infrared
Optical Telescope Array (IOTA) interferometer at near-infrared wavelengths (H
band) and with angular resolutions in the range 5-10 milliarcseconds. These
nonzero closure phases can only be generated by asymmetric brightness
distributions of the target stars or their surroundings. We discuss how these
results were obtained, and how they might be interpreted in terms of structures
on or near the target stars. We also report measured angular sizes and
hypothesize that most Mira stars would show detectable asymmetry if observed
with adequate angular resolution.",2006-07-07T22:58:31Z
"Spreading of thermonuclear flames on the neutron star in SAX
  J1808.4-3658: an observational tool","We analyse archival Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) proportional counter
array (PCA) data of thermonuclear X-ray bursts from the 2002 outburst of the
accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. We present evidence of
nonmonotonic variations of oscillation frequency during burst rise, and
correlations among the time evolution of the oscillation frequency, amplitude,
and the inferred burning region area. We also discuss that the amplitude and
burning region area evolutions are consistent with thermonuclear flame
spreading on the neutron star surface. Based on this discussion, we infer that
for the 2002 Oct. 15 thermonuclear burst, the ignition likely occured in the
mid-latitudes, the burning region took ~ 0.2 s to nearly encircle the
equatorial region of the neutron star, and after that the lower amplitude
oscillation originated from the remaining asymmetry of the burning front in the
same hemisphere where the burst ignited. Our observational findings and
theoretical discussion indicate that studies of the evolution of burst
oscillation properties during burst rise can provide a powerful tool to
understand thermonuclear flame spreading on neutron star surfaces under extreme
physical conditions.",2006-04-03T20:33:34Z
"A Comptonization Model for the Prompt Optical and Infrared Emission of
  GRB 041219A","Prompt optical emission from the $\gamma$-ray burst of GRB 041219A has been
reported by Vestrand et al. There was a fast rise of optical emission
simultaneous with the dominant $\gamma$-ray pulse, and a tight correlation with
the prompt $\gamma$-ray emission has been displayed. These indicate that the
prompt optical emission and $\gamma$-ray emission would naturally have a common
origin. We propose that this optical component can be modeled by considering
the Comptonization of $\gamma$-ray photons by an electron cloud. As a result of
this mechanism, the arrival time of the optical photons is delayed compared
with that of the $\gamma$-rays. We restrict that the lag time to be shorter
than 10 s, within which the prompt optical emission is considered to vary
simultaneously with the prompt $\gamma$-ray emission. Taking the observations
of GRB 041219A into account, we derive the number density of the surrounding
electron cloud required for Comptonization. The redshift of GRB 041219A is

  INTEGRAL IBIS/ISGRI instrument","Context. In coded mask techniques, reconstructed sky images are
pseudo-images: they are maps of the correlation between the image recorded on a
detector and an array derived from the coded mask pattern. Aims. The
INTEGRAL/IBIS telescope provides images where the flux of each detected source
is given by the height of the local peak in the correlation map. As such, it
cannot provide an estimate of the flux of an extended source. What is needed is
intensity sky images giving the flux per solide angle as typically done at
other wavelengths. Methods. In this paper, we present the response of the
INTEGRAL IBIS/ISGRI coded mask instrument to extended sources. We develop a
general method based on analytical calculations in order to measure the
intensity and the associated error of any celestial source and validated with
Monte-Carlo simulations. Results. We find that the sensitivity degrades almost
linearly with the source extent. Analytical formulae are given as well as an
easy-to-use recipe for the INTEGRAL user. We check this method on IBIS/ISGRI
data but these results are general and applicable to any coded mask telescope.",2006-06-06T11:37:59Z
The X-ray afterglow of the short gamma ray burst 050724,"Short duration (<2 s) Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been a mystery since their
discovery. Until May 2005 very little was known about short GRBs, but this
situation has changed rapidly in the last few months since the Swift and HETE-2
satellites have made it possible to discover X-ray and optical counterparts to
these sources. Positional associations indicate that short GRBs arise in
close-by galaxies (z<0.7). Here we report on a detailed study of the short GRB
050724 X-ray afterglow. This burst shows strong flaring variability in the
X-ray band. It clearly confirms early suggestions of X-ray activity in the
50-100 s time interval following the GRB onset seen with BATSE. Late flare
activity is also observed. These observations support the idea that flares are
related to the inner engine for short GRBs, as well as long GRBs.",2006-03-17T16:50:24Z
"The CFHTLS Real Time Analysis System ""Optically Selected GRB Afterglows""","We describe a wide and deep search for optical GRB afterglows on images taken
with MegaCAM at the Canada France Hawaii Telescope, within the framework of the
CFHT Legacy Survey. This search is performed in near real-time thanks to a Real
Time Analysis System called ""Optically Selected GRB Afterglows"", which has been
completely realized and installed on a dedicated computer in Hawaii. This
pipeline automatically and quickly analyzes Megacam images and extracts from
them a list of astrometrically and photometrically variable objects which are
displayed on a web page for validation by a member of the collaboration. In
this paper, we comprehensively describe the RTAS process. We also present
statistical results based on nearly one full year of operation, showing the
quality of the images and the performance of the RTAS. Finally, we compare the
efficiency of this study with similar searches, propose an ideal observational
strategy using simulations, and discuss general considerations on the searches
for GRB afterglows independently of the prompt emission. This is the first of a
series of two papers. A second paper will discuss the characterization of
variable objects we have found, as well as the GRB afterglow candidates and
their nature. We will also estimate or at least constrain the collimation
factor of GRB using the totality of the Very Wide Survey observations.",2006-05-31T18:03:25Z
Coupled Quintessence and CMB,"We revise the stability of the tracking solutions and briefly review the
potentials of quintessence models. We discuss the evolution of linear
perturbations for $V(\phi) = V_{0} \exp(\lambda \phi^2/2)$ potential in which
the scalar field is non-minimally coupled to cold dark matter. We consider the
effects of this coupling on both cosmic microwave background temperature
anisotropies and matter perturbations. We find that the phenomenology of this
model is consistent with current observations up to the coupling power $n_{c}
\leq 0.01$ while adopting the current parameters measured by WMAP,
$\Omega_{\phi}^{(0)}=0.76$, $\Omega_{cdm}^{(0)}=0.191$,
$\Omega_{b}^{(0)}=0.049$, and $h=0.70$. Upcoming cosmic microwave background
observations continuing to focus on resolving the higher peaks may put strong
constraints on the strength of the coupling.",2006-04-28T10:18:51Z
CS 30322-023: an ultra metal-poor TP-AGB star?,"With [Fe/H] = -3.5, CS 30322-023 is the most metal-poor star to exhibit a
clear s-process signature and the most metal-poor ``lead star'' known. CS
30322-023 is also remarkable in having the lowest surface gravity (log g <=
-0.3) among the metal-poor stars studied to date. The available evidence
indicates that this star is presently a thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant
branch (TP-AGB) star, with no strong indication of binarity thus far (although
a signal of period 192 d is clearly present in the radial-velocity data, this
is likely due to pulsation of the stellar envelope). We show that low-mass
TP-AGB stars are not expected to be exceedingly rare in a magnitude-limited
sample such as the HK survey, because their high luminosities make it possible
to sample them over a very large volume. The strong N overabundance and the low
12C/13C ratio (4) in this star is typical of the operation of the CN cycle.
Coupled with a Na overabundance and the absence of a strong C overabundance,
this pattern seems to imply that hot-bottom burning operated in this star,
which should then have a mass of at least 2 Msun. However, the luminosity
associated with this mass would put the star at a distance of about 50 kpc, in
the outskirts of the galactic halo. We explore alternative scenarios in which
the observed abundance pattern results from some mixing mechanism yet to be
identified occurring in a single low-metallicity 0.8 Msun AGB star, or from
pollution by matter from an intermediate-mass AGB companion which has undergone
hot-bottom burning. We stress, however, that our abundances may be subject to
uncertainties due to NLTE or 3D granulation effects which were not taken into
consideration.",2006-05-26T09:23:28Z
"Simulation of Coherent Non-Linear Neutrino Flavor Transformation in the
  Supernova Environment I: Correlated Neutrino Trajectories","We present results of large-scale numerical simulations of the evolution of
neutrino and antineutrino flavors in the region above the late-time
post-supernova-explosion proto-neutron star. Our calculations are the first to
allow explicit flavor evolution histories on different neutrino trajectories
and to self-consistently couple flavor development on these trajectories
through forward scattering-induced quantum entanglement. Employing the
atmospheric-scale neutrino mass-squared difference and values of theta_13
allowed by current bounds, we find transformation of neutrino and antineutrino
flavors over broad ranges of energy and luminosity in roughly the ``bi-polar''
collective mode. We find that this large-scale flavor conversion, largely
driven by the flavor off-diagonal neutrino-neutrino forward scattering
potential, sets in much closer to the proto-neutron star than simple estimates
based on flavor-diagonal potentials and Mikeheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein evolution
would indicate. In turn, this suggests that models of r-process nucleosynthesis
sited in the neutrino-driven wind could be affected substantially by
active-active neutrino flavor mixing, even with the small measured neutrino
mass-squared differences.",2006-06-25T20:19:16Z
"Common Correlations between 60, 100 and 140 um Intensities in the
  Galactic Plane and Magellanic Clouds","We investigate the far-infrared SED of the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds
by using the COBE (COsmic Background Explorer) / DIRBE (Diffuse InfraRed
Background Experiment) ZSMA (Zodi - Subtracted Mission Average) maps at
wavelengths of 60 um, 100 um and 140 um. We analyze three regions: the Galactic
plane region with the Galactic latitude |b|<5 degree, the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC) region, and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) region. Because the
dust optical depth is much smaller in the far-infrared than in the visible, we
may observe cumulative far-infrared radiation from regions with various
interstellar radiation field (IRSF) in a line of sight. As consequence of
considering such an effect, we find a common far-infrared color correlation
between the 140 - 100 um and 60 - 100 um intensity ratios in all the three
galaxies. Although this color correlation cannot be explained by any existing
model, it fits very well the far-infrared color of nearby star forming
galaxies.",2006-04-10T06:28:27Z
"XMM-Newton and ESO observations of the two unidentified gamma-ray
  sources 3EG J0616-3310 and 3EG J1249-8330","The limited angular resolution of gamma-ray telescopes prevents a direct
identification of the majority of sources detected so far. This is particularly
true for the low latitude, probably galactic, ones only 10 % of which has been
identified. Most counterparts of the identified low-latitude gamma-ray sources
are Isolated Neutron Stars (INS), both radio-loud and radio-quiet
(Geminga-like) objects, which are characterised by an extremely high value of
the X-ray-to-optical flux ratio f_X/f_opt. Therefore, the systematic X-ray and
optical coverage of low-latitude unidentified gamma-ray sources aiming at high
f_X/f_opt sources seems one of the most promising ways to spot INS candidate
counterparts. Since low latitude sources are heavily affected by the
interstellar absorption at both X-ray and optical wavelengths, we have focussed
on two middle-latitude, probably galactic, GRO/EGRET sources: 3EG J0616-3310
and 3EG J1249-8330. These two sources, which could belong to a local galactic
population, have been selected owing to their relatively good positional
accuracy, spectral shape and lack of candidate extragalactic radio
counterparts. Here we report on X-ray observations of the two gamma-ray error
boxes performed with XMM-Newton and on their optical follow-up carried on with
the Wide Field Imager at the ESO/MPG 2.2m telescope. Less than half of the ~300
sources detected by the X-ray coverage have no optical counterparts. Among
those, we have selected few interesting sources with f_X/f_opt > 100, which we
consider promising INS candidates.",2006-07-12T14:40:41Z
A Large Dark Matter Core in the Fornax Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy?,"We use measurements of the stellar velocity dispersion profile of the Fornax
dwarf spheroidal galaxy to derive constraints on its dark matter distribution.
Though the data are unable to distinguish between models with small cores and
those with cusps, we show that a large > 1 kpc dark matter core in Fornax is
highly implausible. Irrespective of the origin of the core, reasonable
dynamical limits on the mass of the Fornax halo constrain its core radius to be
no larger than 700 pc. We derive an upper limit core radius of 300 pc by
demanding that the central phase space density of Fornax not exceed that
directly inferred from the rotation curves of low-mass spiral galaxies.
Further, if the halo is composed of warm dark matter then phase-space
constraints force the core to be quite small in order to avoid conservative
limits from the Ly alpha forest power spectrum, implying a core radius < 85 pc.
We discuss our results in the context of the idea that the extended globular
cluster distribution in Fornax can be explained by the presence of a large 1.5
kpc core. A self-consistent core of this size would be drastically inconsistent
with the expectations of standard warm or cold dark matter models, and would
also require an unreasonably massive dark matter halo, with a maximum circular
velocity of 200 km/s.",2006-03-29T01:37:26Z
Precision Measurement of Optical Pulsation using a Cherenkov Telescope,"During 2003, a camera designed to measure the optical pulsations of pulsars
was installed on a telescope of the H.E.S.S. array. The array is designed for
gamma-ray astronomy in the ~100 GeV - 100 TeV energy regime. The aims of this
exercise were two-fold: to prove the pulsar timing capabilities of H.E.S.S. on
all relevant time-scales, and to explore the possibility of performing
sensitive optical pulsar measurements using the ~100 m^2 mirror of a Cherenkov
telescope. Measurements of the Crab pulsar with this instrument demonstrate an
order of magnitude sensitivity improvement over previous attempts using
Cherenkov telescopes. Here we describe the design and performance of the system
and discuss design considerations for future instruments of this type.",2006-04-19T16:07:49Z
Phantom Dark Energy Models with Negative Kinetic Term,"We examine phantom dark energy models derived from a scalar field with a
negative kinetic term for which V(phi) approaches infinity asymptotically. All
such models can be divided into three classes, corresponding to an equation of
state parameter w with asymptotic behavior w -> -1, w -> w_0 < -1, and w ->
infinity. We derive the conditions on the potential V(phi) which lead to each
of these three types of behavior. For models with w -> -1, we derive the
conditions on V(phi) which determine whether or not such models produce a
future big rip. Observational constraints are derived on two classes of these
models: power-law potentials with V(phi) = lambda phi^alpha (with alpha
positive or negative) and exponential potentials of the form V(phi) = beta
e^{lambda phi^alpha}. It is shown that these models spend more time in a state
with Omega_m ~ Omega_phi than do corresponding models with a constant value of
w, thus providing a more satisfactory solution to the coincidence problem.",2006-06-29T19:28:10Z
Modelling of the spectra and atmospheres of evolved stars,"The method and results of the computation of the model atmospheres and
spectral energy distributions of chemically peculiar stars, are discussed. The
models are computed with a special consideration of the particular problems
encountered when computing model atmospheres for M and C-giants, and of
hydrogen deficient stars. We present some computed model atmospheres for
Sakurai's object, giants of globular clusters, and C-giants.",2006-06-11T16:08:40Z
The Limits of Bound Structures in the Accelerating Universe,"According to the latest evidence, the Universe is entering an era of
exponential expansion, where gravitationally bound structures will get
disconnected from each other, forming isolated `island universes'. In this
scenario, we present a theoretical criterion to determine the boundaries of
gravitationally bound structures and a physically motivated definition of
superclusters as the largest bound structures in the Universe. We use the
spherical collapse model self-consistently to obtain an analytical condition
for the mean density enclosed by the last bound shell of the structure (2.36
times the critical density in the present Universe, assumed to be flat, with 30
per cent matter and 70 per cent cosmological constant, in agreement with the
previous, numerical result of Chiueh and He). $N$-body simulations extended to
the future show that this criterion, applied at the present cosmological epoch,
defines a sphere that encloses $\approx 99.7$ per cent of the particles that
will remain bound to the structure at least until the scale parameter of the
Universe is 100 times its present value. On the other hand, $(28\pm 13)$ per
cent of the enclosed particles are in fact not bound, so the enclosed mass
overestimates the bound mass, in contrast with the previous, less rigorous
criterion of, e.~g., Busha and collaborators, which gave a more precise mass
estimate. We also verify that the spherical collapse model estimate for the
radial infall velocity of a shell enclosing a given mean density gives an
accurate prediction for the velocity profile of infalling particles, down to
very near the centre of the virialized core.",2006-03-26T23:34:24Z
"On the search of electromagnetic cosmological counterparts to
  coalescences of massive black hole binaries","We explore the nature of possible electromagnetic counterparts of
coalescences of massive black hole binaries at cosmological distances
detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). An electromagnetic
precursor, during the last year of gravitational wave (GW)-driven inspiral, or
an afterglow within few years after coalescence, may highlight the position in
the sky of galaxies hosting LISA sources. We show that observations of
precursors and afterglows are mutually exclusive, depending on the mass of the
primary black hole. Precursors are expected to occur in binaries where the
primary (more massive) black hole is heavier than ~10^7 \Msun. They may
correspond to on-off states of accretion, i.e., to a bright X-ray source
decaying into quiescence before black hole coalescence, and are likely
associated to disturbed galaxies showing signs of ongoing starbursts.
Coalescences of lighter binaries, with masses <5x10^6 \Msun, lack of any
precursor, as gas is expected to be consumed long before the GW-driven orbital
decay. Such events would not be hosted by (massive) galaxies with an associated
starburst, given the slow binary inspiral time compared to the typical time
scale of starbursts. By contrast, coalescence, for such light binaries, is
followed by an electromagnetic afterglow, i.e., an off-on accretion state
rising in <20 yrs. Using a cosmological merger tree algorithm, we show that
future X-ray missions such as XEUS will be able to identify, in 20 yrs
operation, almost all the massive BH binary detectable by LISA, and, in only 5
yrs, all the LISA sources at z>6.",2006-05-24T13:21:18Z
Radiative transfer in protoplanetary disks,"We present a new 3D continuum radiative transfer code, MCFOST, based on a
Monte-Carlo method. The reliability and efficiency of the code is tested by
comparison with five different radiative transfer codes previously tested by
Pascucci et al., 2004, using a 2D disk configuration. When tested against the
same disk configuration, no significant difference is found between the
temperature and SED calculated with MCFOST and with the other codes. The
computed values are well within the range of values computed by the other
codes. The code-to-code differences are small, they rarely exceed 10% and are
usually much smaller.",2006-04-04T15:51:41Z
The Carbon-Rich Gas in the Beta Pictoris Circumstellar Disk,"The edge-on disk surrounding the nearby young star Beta Pictoris is the
archetype of the ""debris disks"", which are composed of dust and gas produced by
collisions and evaporation of planetesimals, analogues of Solar System comets
and asteroids. These disks provide a window on the formation and early
evolution of terrestrial planets. Previous observations of Beta Pic concluded
that the disk gas has roughly solar abundances of elements [1], but this poses
a problem because such gas should be rapidly blown away from the star, contrary
to observations of a stable gas disk in Keplerian rotation [1, 2]. Here we
report the detection of singly and doubly ionized carbon (CII, CIII) and
neutral atomic oxygen (OI) gas in the Beta Pic disk; measurement of these
abundant volatile species permits a much more complete gas inventory. Carbon is
extremely overabundant relative to every other measured element. This appears
to solve the problem of the stable gas disk, since the carbon overabundance
should keep the gas disk in Keplerian rotation [3]. New questions arise,
however, since the overabundance may indicate the gas is produced from material
more carbon-rich than the expected Solar System analogues.",2006-04-19T19:58:12Z
Hubble Space Telescope Observations of Star Clusters in M101,"Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) images are used to
identify and study star cluster candidates in the nearby spiral galaxy M101.
About 3000 round, slightly-resolved cluster candidates are identified in 10 ACS
pointings covering an area of 106 arcmin^2. The cluster candidates' color and
size distributions are consistent with those of star clusters in other nearby
spirals. The majority of the M101 candidates are blue and more likely to be
associated with the galaxy's spiral arms, implying that they are young. The
galaxy-luminosity-normalized number of `young massive clusters' in M101 is
similar to that found in other spirals, as is the cluster density at a fiducial
absolute magnitude. We confirm a previous finding that M101 has a large number
of faint, red star clusters: if these are old globular clusters then this
galaxy has a very large globular cluster population. More plausible is that the
faint red clusters are reddened young clusters; their colors and luminosities
are also consistent with this explanation.",2006-05-18T13:21:19Z
Coincidence of Universe age in $Λ$CDM and Milne cosmologies,"The age of the Universe in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with
$\Omega_{matter}=0.26$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.74$ is the same as in the Milne
cosmology which correspods to an almost empty universe. In both cases it is a
reciprocal Hubble constant, $1/H_0$, that for now preferred value $H_0=71
km/s/Mpc$ is 13.7 billion years. The most curious coincidence is that at the
present time, in the $\Lambda$CDM model the decelerated expansion is exactly
compensated by the accelerated expansion, as if the Universe coast for 13.7
billion years.",2006-05-08T17:32:32Z
Merging of a massive binary due to ejection of bound stars,"From the results of numerical scattering experiments and simulations of a
massive black hole binary in spherically symmetric and shallow cores it has
been deduced that most likely the shrinking process stalls due to loss-cone
depletion before emission of gravitational radiation becomes important. Here we
follow a different approach and focus on the population of stars which is bound
to the binary and so far has not received much attention. With simple
assumptions which should not be sensitive to initial conditions we derive a
lower limit for the mass of stars which needs to be ejected by the binary in
order to coalesce. We also compute this mass in dependence on the steepness of
the density profile according to which the stars are distributed. Our results
are not as pessimistic as earlier conclusions and actually suggest that the BHs
merge.",2006-05-24T09:15:48Z
New Observations and Models of the Kinematics of the Zodiacal Dust Cloud,"We report on new observations of the motion of zodiacal dust using optical
absorption line spectroscopy of zodiacal light. We have measured the change in
the profile shape of the scattered solar Mg I 5184 line toward several lines of
sight in the ecliptic plane as well as the ecliptic pole. The variation in line
centroid and line width as a function of helio-ecliptic longitude show a clear
prograde signature and suggest that significant fraction of the dust follows
non-circular orbits that are not confined to the ecliptic plane. When combined
with dynamical models, the data suggest that the zodiacal dust is largely
cometary, rather than asteroidal, in origin.",2006-04-11T06:56:26Z
UV Radiative Feedback on High-Redshift Proto-Galaxies,"We use three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the effects
of a transient photoionizing ultraviolet (UV) flux on the collapse and cooling
of pregalactic clouds. These clouds have masses in the range 10^5 -10^7 M_sun,
form at high redshifts (z>18), are assumed to lie within the short-lived
cosmological HII regions around the first generation of stars. In addition, we
study the combined effects of this transient UV flux and a persistent
Lyman-Werner (LW) background from distant sources. In the absence of a LW
background, we find that a critical specific intensity of J_UV ~ 0.1 x 10^-21
ergs s^-1 cm^-2 Hz^-1 sr^-1 demarcates a transition from net negative to
positive feedback for the halo population. A weaker UV flux stimulates
subsequent star formation inside the fossil HII regions, by enhancing the H_2
molecule abundance. A stronger UV flux significantly delays star-formation by
reducing the gas density, and increasing the cooling time, at the centers of
collapsing halos. At a fixed J_UV, the sign of the feedback also depends
strongly on the density of the gas at the time of UV illumination. Regardless
of the whether the feedback is positive or negative, we find that once the UV
flux is turned off, its impact stars to diminish after ~30% of the Hubble time.
In the more realistic case when a LW background is present, with J_LW > 0.01 x
10^-21 ergs s^-1 cm^-2 Hz^-1 sr^-1, strong suppression persists down to the
lowest redshift (z=18) in our simulations. Finally, we find evidence that
heating and photoevaporation by the transient UV flux renders the ~10^6 M_sun
halos inside fossil HII regions more vulnerable to subsequent H_2
photo-dissociation by a LW background.",2006-04-07T10:23:48Z
"Population III star formation in a Lambda CDM universe, I: The effect of
  formation redshift and environment on protostellar accretion rate","(abridged) We perform 12 extremely high resolution adaptive mesh refinement
cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of Population III star formation in a
Lambda CDM universe, varying the box size and large-scale structure, to
understand systematic effects in the formation of primordial protostellar
cores. We find results that are qualitatively similar to those observed
previously. We observe that the threshold halo mass for formation of a
Population III protostar does not evolve significantly with time in the
redshift range studied (33 > z > 19) but exhibits substantial scatter due to
different halo assembly histories: Halos which assembled more slowly develop
cooling cores at lower mass than those that assemble more rapidly, in agreement
with Yoshida et al. (2003). We do, however, observe significant evolution in
the accretion rates of Population III protostars with redshift, with objects
that form later having higher maximum accretion rates, with a variation of two
orders of magnitude (10^-4 - 10^-2 Msolar/year). This can be explained by
considering the evolving virial properties of the halos with redshift and the
physics of molecular hydrogen formation at low densities. Our result implies
that the mass distribution of Population III stars inferred from their
accretion rates may be broader than previously thought, and may evolve with
redshift. Finally, we observe that our collapsing protostellar cloud cores do
not fragment, consistent with previous results, which suggests that Population
III stars which form in halos of mass 10^5 - 10^6 Msun always form in
isolation.",2006-07-02T19:06:05Z
"Einstein Field Equation: the Root of All Evil? Quantum Gravity, Solar
  Application and the Prediction on Gravity Probe B","The starting point of quantum mechanics is the relationship between energy
and momentum: energy is proportional to the squared momentum! As a result,
energy and momentum have not been treated equally. The wave equation required
by quantization is a differential equation which accordingly, does not treat
time and space equally. As a result, the Planck constant is not canceled out
from the two sides of the equation. Dr. He's gravity is the local bending of
background space-time which as suggested by Einstein, can be described by a
differential form of second order, and treats time and space equally.
Therefore, the Planck constant is completely canceled out in the resulting wave

Cosmological science enabled by Planck,"Planck will be the first mission to map the entire cosmic microwave
background (CMB) sky with mJy sensitivity and resolution better than 10'. The
science enabled by such a mission spans many areas of astrophysics and
cosmology. In particular it will lead to a revolution in our understanding of
primary and secondary CMB anisotropies, the constraints on many key

sub-percent levels) and the shape and amplitude of the mass power spectrum at
high redshift will be tightly constrained.",2006-06-27T00:13:20Z
Do mean-field dynamos in nonrotating turbulent shear-flows exist?,"A plane-shear flow in a fluid with forced turbulence is considered. If the
fluid is electrically-conducting then a mean electromotive force (EMF) results
even without basic rotation and the magnetic diffusivity becomes a highly
anisotropic tensor. It is checked whether in this case self-excitation of a
large-scale magnetic field is possible (so-called WxJ-dynamo) and the answer is
NO. The calculations reveal the cross-stream components of the EMF
perpendicular to the mean current having the wrong signs, at least for small
magnetic Prandtl numbers. After our results numerical simulations with magnetic
Prandtl number of about unity have only a restricted meaning as the Prandtl
number dependence of the diffusivity tensor is rather strong. If, on the other
hand, the turbulence field is stratified in the vertical direction then a
dynamo active alpha-effect is produced. The critical magnetic Reynolds number
for such a self-excitation in a simple shear flow is slightly above 10 like for
the other - but much more complicated - flow patterns used in existing dynamo
experiments with liquid sodium or gallium.",2006-04-18T10:25:14Z
The Complete BATSE Spectral Catalog of Bright Gamma-Ray Bursts,"We present a systematic spectral analysis of 350 bright Gamma-Ray Bursts
(GRBs) observed with the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE; $\sim$
30 keV -- 2 MeV) with high temporal and spectral resolution. Our sample was
selected from the complete set of 2704 BATSE GRBs based on their energy fluence
or peak photon flux values to assure good statistics, and included 17 short
GRBs. To obtain well-constrained spectral parameters, several photon models
were used to fit each spectrum. We compared spectral parameters resulting from
the fits using different models, and the spectral parameters that best
represent each spectrum were statistically determined, taking into account the
parameterization differences among the models. A thorough analysis was
performed on 350 time-integrated and 8459 time-resolved burst spectra, and the
effects of integration times in determining the spectral parameters were
explored. Using the results, we studied correlations among spectral parameters
and their evolution pattern within each burst. The resulting spectral catalog
is the most comprehensive study of spectral properties of GRB prompt emission
to date, and is available electronically from the High-Energy Astrophysics
Science Archive Research Center (HEASARC). The catalog provides reliable
constraints on particle acceleration and emission mechanisms in GRBs.",2006-05-17T19:33:28Z
Transients from Initial Conditions in Cosmological Simulations,"We study the impact of setting initial conditions in numerical simulations
using the standard procedure based on the Zel'dovich approximation (ZA). As it
is well known from perturbation theory, ZA initial conditions have incorrect
second and higher-order growth and therefore excite long-lived transients in
the evolution of the statistical properties of density and velocity fields. We
also study the improvement brought by using more accurate initial conditions
based on second-order Lagrangian perturbation theory (2LPT). We show that 2LPT
initial conditions reduce transients significantly and thus are much more
appropriate for numerical simulations devoted to precision cosmology. Using
controlled numerical experiments with ZA and 2LPT initial conditions we show
that simulations started at redshift z_i=49 using the ZA underestimate the
power spectrum in the nonlinear regime by about 2,4,8 % at z=0,1,3
respectively, whereas the mass function of dark matter halos is underestimated
by 5% at m=10^15 M_sun/h (z=0) and 10% at m=2x10^14M_sun/h (z=1). The
clustering of halos is also affected to the few percent level at z=0. These
systematics effects are typically larger than statistical uncertainties in
recent mass function and power spectrum fitting formulae extracted from
numerical simulations. At large scales, the measured transients in higher-order
correlations can be understood from first principle calculations based on
perturbation theory.",2006-06-21T12:36:29Z
Smooth Particle Lensing,"We present a numerical technique to compute the gravitational lensing induced
by simulated haloes. It relies on a 2D-Tree domain decomposition in the lens
plane combined with a description of N-Body particles as extended clouds with a
non-singular density. This technique is made fully adaptive by the use of a
density-dependent smoothing which allows one to probe the lensing properties of
haloes from the densest regions in the center or in substructures to the
low-density regions in the outskirts. 'Smooth Particle Lensing' has some
promising features. First, the deflection potential, the deflection angles, the
convergence and the shear are direct and separate end-products of the SPL
calculation and can be computed at an arbitrary distribution of points on the
lens plane. Second, this flexibility avoids the use of interpolation or a
finite differentiation procedure on a grid, does not require padding the region
with zeros and focuses the computing power on relevant regions. The SPL
algorithm is tested by populating isothermal spheres and ellipsoids with
particles and then comparing the lensing calculations to the classical
FFT-based technique and analytic solutions. We assess issues related to the
resolution of the lensing code and the limitations set by the simulations
themselves. We conclude by discussing how SPL can be used to predict the impact
of substructures on strong lensing and how it can be generalized to weak
lensing and cosmic shear simulations.",2006-04-17T20:45:38Z
The Ultraluminous X-ray Source IC342 X-1 and its Environment,"We present optical observations of a ULX in the nearby spiral galaxy IC 342.
This variable source has an average X-ray luminosity of some 10^{40} erg/s. At
the position of the source there is an ionized nebula (the ""Tooth"") having huge
dimensions (280 x 130 pc), much larger than normal supernova remnants. Our
optical spectra reveal highly supersonic expansion velocities and emission line
ratios typical of SNRs. It has been claimed that two [OIII] 5007 bright regions
in the nebula might be indicative of excitation by non-isotropic emission from
the ULX. However, our continuum subtracted [OIII] 5007 image reveals that
O^{++} ions are rather smoothly distributed in the nebula, fully consistent
with shock excitation. Within the nebula we find two candidate stars (V=24.0 &
24.6) in the Chandra X-ray error circle. Both are substantially reddened being
consistent with the patchy interstellar absorption. We will discuss the nature
of this source in the framework of what is currently known about optical
counterparts of ULXs.",2006-03-28T17:07:07Z
Sensitivity and pointing accuracy of the NEMO km$^3$ telescope,"n this paper we present the results of Monte Carlo simulation studies on the
capability of the proposed NEMO km3 telescope to detect high energy neutrinos.
We calculated the detector sensitivity to muon neutrinos coming from a generic
point-like source. We also simulated the lack of atmospheric muons in
correspondence to the Moon disk in order to determine the detector angular
resolution and to check the absolute pointing capability.",2006-05-02T19:27:12Z
"Jet Breaks in Short Gamma-Ray Bursts. I: The Uncollimated Afterglow of
  GRB 050724","We report the results of the \chandra observations of the \swift-discovered
short Gamma-Ray Burst GRB 050724. \chandra observed this burst twice, about two
days after the burst and a second time three weeks later. The first \chandra
pointing occurred at the end of a strong late-time flare. About 150 photons
were detected during this 49.3 ks observation in the 0.4-10.0 keV range. The
spectral fit is in good agreement with spectral analysis of earlier \swift XRT
data. In the second \chandra pointing the afterglow was clearly detected with 8
background-subtracted photons in 44.6 ks. From the combined \swift XRT and
\chandra-ACIS-S light curve we find significant flaring superposed on an
underlying power-law decay slope of $\alpha$=0.98$^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$. There is
no evidence for a break between about 1 ks after the burst and the last
\chandra pointing about three weeks after the burst. The non-detection of a jet
break places a lower limit of 25$^{\circ}$ on the jet opening angle, indicating
that the outflow is less strongly collimated than most previously-reported long
GRBs. This implies that the beaming corrected energy of GRB 050724 is at least
$4\times 10^{49}$ ergs.",2006-03-28T21:00:22Z
{Millimeter Multiplicity in NGC 6334 I and I(N),"Using the Submillimeter Array (SMA), we have imaged the 1.3 millimeter
continuum emission at the center of the massive star-forming regions NGC 6334 I
and I(N). In both regions, the SMA observations resolve the emission into
multiple millimeter sources, with most of the sources clustered into areas only
10,000 AU in diameter. Toward NGC 6334 I, we find four compact sources: the two
brightest (I-SMA1 and I-SMA2) are associated with previously-known ammonia
cores; I-SMA3 is coincident with the peak of the compact HII region (NGC 6334
F); and I-SMA4 is a newly-discovered object. While I-SMA3 exhibits a mixture of
free-free and dust emission, the rest of the objects are dust cores. Toward NGC
6334 I(N), seven compact dust cores are found, one of which is associated with
a faint centimeter source. With the exception of I-SMA3, none of the millimeter
sources have infrared counterparts in Spitzer Space Telescope 3-8 micron
images. Using a simple physical model for the dust continuum emission, the
estimated mass of interstellar material toward each of these compact objects is
in the range of 3 to 66 solar masses. The total mass in the compact objects
appears to be similar in I and I(N). The small size of these groups of sources
suggest that these objects are proto-Trapezia forming in the centers of
clusters of low to intermediate-mass stars.",2006-05-18T19:51:25Z
Accurate stellar masses in the multiple system T Tau,"The goal of this study is to obtain accurate estimates for the individual
masses of the components of the tight binary system T Tau S in order to settle
the ongoing debate on the nature of T Tau Sa, a so-called infrared companion.
We take advantage of the fact that T Tau S belongs to a triple system composed
of two hierarchical orbits to simultaneously analyze the motion of T Tau Sb in
the rest frames of T Tau Sa and T Tau N. With this method, it is possible to
pinpoint the location of the center of mass of T Tau S and, thereby, to
determine individual masses for T Tau Sa and T Tau Sb with no prior assumption
about the mass/flux ratio of the system. This improvement over previous studies
of the system results in much better constraints on orbital parameters. We find
individual masses of 2.73+/-0.31 Msun for T Tau Sa and of 0.61+/-0.17 Msun for
T Tau Sb (in agreement with its early-M spectral type), including the
uncertainty on the distance to the system. These are among the most precise
estimates of the mass of any Pre-Main Sequence star, a remarkable result since
this is the first system in which individual masses of T Tauri stars can be
determined from astrometry only. This model-independent analysis confirms that
T Tau Sa is an intermediate-mass star, presumably a very young Herbig Ae star,
that may possess an almost edge-on disk.",2006-08-01T13:26:15Z
Wind-Blown Bubbles around Evolved Stars,"Most stars will experience episodes of substantial mass loss at some point in
their lives. For very massive stars, mass loss dominates their evolution,
although the mass loss rates are not known exactly, particularly once the star
has left the main sequence. Direct observations of the stellar winds of massive
stars can give information on the current mass-loss rates, while studies of the
ring nebulae and HI shells that surround many Wolf-Rayet (WR) and luminous blue
variable (LBV) stars provide information on the previous mass-loss history. The
evolution of the most massive stars, (M > 25 solar masses), essentially follows
the sequence O star to LBV or red supergiant (RSG) to WR star to supernova. For
stars of mass less than 25 solar masses there is no final WR stage. During the
main sequence and WR stages, the mass loss takes the form of highly supersonic
stellar winds, which blow bubbles in the interstellar and circumstellar medium.
In this way, the mechanical luminosity of the stellar wind is converted into
kinetic energy of the swept-up ambient material, which is important for the
dynamics of the interstellar medium. In this review article, analytic and
numerical models are used to describe the hydrodynamics and energetics of
wind-blown bubbles. A brief review of observations of bubbles is given, and the
degree to which theory is supported by observations is discussed.",2006-05-21T04:10:06Z
Origin of the Counter-Rotating Gas in NGC 1596,"We present Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) HI imaging of the edge-on
galaxy NGC 1596, which was recently found to have counter-rotating ionized gas
in its center (<15""). We find a large HI envelope associated with a nearby
companion, the dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 1602. The HI covers a region
\~11.9'x13.4' (62x70 kpc^2) and the total HI mass detected is 2.5+/-0.1x10^9
Msun (assuming an 18 Mpc distance). The HI is centered on NGC 1602 but appears
to have two tidal tails, one of which crosses over NGC 1596. The HI located at
the position of NGC 1596 has a velocity gradient in the same sense as the
ionized gas, i.e. opposite to the stellar rotation. Both the existence of a
large gas reservoir and the velocity gradient of the HI and the ionized gas
strongly suggest that the ionized gas in NGC 1596 originated from NGC 1602.
  From the length of the HI tails we conclude that the interaction started at
least 1 Gyr ago, but the unsettled, asymmetric distribution of the ionized gas
suggests that the accretion occured more recently. NGC 1596 thus provides a
good example where the presence of counter-rotating gas can be directly linked
to an accretion event. After the accretion has stopped or the merging is
complete, NGC 1596 may evolve to a system with more extended counter-rotating
gas but no obvious signature of interaction. There is a substantial local HI
peak in one of the two tails, where we also find a faint stellar counterpart.
The M_HI/L_B ratio in this region is too high for a normal dwarf elliptical or
a low surface brightness galaxy, so we conclude that a tidal dwarf is currently
forming there.",2006-05-23T20:01:43Z
"Electron impact excitation of Helium-like ions up to n=4 levels
  including radiation damping","Helium-like ions provide the most important X-ray spectral diagnostics in
high temperature fusion and astrophysical plasmas. We previously presented
computed collision strengths for O~VII including relativistic fine structure,
levels up to the $n=4$ complex and radiation damping of autoionizing
resonances. We have extended this work to other He-like ions (N, Ne, Mg, Al,
Si, S, Ca). The calculations are carried out using the Breit-Pauli R-matrix
(BPRM) method with a 31-level eigenfunction expansion. Collision strengths for
the principal lines important in X-ray plasma diagnostics, w, x, y and z,
corresponding to the 4 transitions to the ground level 1s^2(^1S_0) <-
1s2p(^1P^o_1), 1s2p(^3P^o_2), 1s2p(^3P^o_1), 1s2s(^3S_1), are explicitly shown.
We find the effect of radiation damping to be significant for the forbidden
transitions in heavier He-like ions, which should affect the diagnostic line
ratios. We extrapolated the collision strengths to their values at infinite
energy using the Burgess-Tully extrapolation technique. This is required to
calculate the Maxwellian average collision strengths at high temperature. We
show that the coupling between dipole allowed and inter-combination transitions
affects increasingly the effective collision strengths for the n ^1S_0 - n'
^3P_1 transition as the charge of the ion increases. This clearly affects the
treatment of the extrapolation toward the infinite energy point of the
collision strength. This work is carried out as part of the Iron Project-RmaX
Network.",2006-03-17T20:48:47Z
"Bright OB stars in the Galaxy - III. Constraints on the radial
  stratification of the clumping factor in hot star winds from a combined
  Halpha, IR and radio analysis","Recent results strongly challenge the canonical picture of massive star
winds: various evidence indicates that currently accepted mass-loss rates,
Mdot, may need to be revised downwards significantly. This is because the most
commonly used mass-loss diagnostics are affected by ``clumping'' (small-scale
density inhomogeneities), influencing our interpretation of observed spectra
and fluxes. Such downward revisions would have dramatic consequences for the
evolution of, and feedback from, massive stars, and thus robust determinations
of the clumping properties and mass-loss rates are urgently needed. Here, we
present a first attempt to constrain the radial stratification of the so-called
clumping factor. To this end, we have analyzed a sample of 19 Galactic O-type
supergiants/giants, by combining data for Halpha, IR, mm and radio fluxes, and
using appropriate analysis methods. Clumping has been included into our
analysis in the ``conventional'' way, by assuming the inter-clump matter to be
void. Because (almost) all our diagnostics depends on the square of density, we
cannot derive absolute clumping factors, but only factors normalized to a
certain minimum. This minimum was usually found to be located in the outermost,
radio-emitting region, i.e., the radio mass-loss rates are the lowest ones,
compared to Mdot derived from Halpha and the IR. The radio rates agree well
with those predicted by theory, but are only upper limits, due to unknown
clumping in the outer wind. Our most important result concerns a (physical)
difference between denser and thinner winds: for denser winds, the innermost
region is more strongly clumped than the outermost one (with a normalized
clumping factor of 4.1+/-1.4), whereas thinner winds have similar clumping
properties in the inner and outer regions.",2006-04-18T06:25:54Z
"Analysing Globular Cluster observations - Models and Analysis Tools for
  Lick/IDS indices","We have extended our evolutionary synthesis code, GALEV, to include Lick/IDS
absorption-line indices for both simple and composite stellar population models
(star clusters and galaxies), using the polynomial fitting functions of Worthey
et al. (1994) and Worthey & Ottaviani (1997). We present a mathematically
advanced Lick Index Analysis Tool (LINO) for the determination of ages and
metallicities of globular clusters (CGs): An extensive grid of GALEV models for
the evolution of star clusters at various metallicities over a Hubble time is
compared to observed sets of Lick indices of varying completeness and
precision. A dedicated chi^2 - minimisation procedure selects the best model
including 1-sigma uncertainties on age and metallicity. We discuss the age and
metallicity sensitivities of individual indices and show that these
sensitivities themselves depend on age and metallicity; thus, we extend
Worthey's (1994) concept of a ""metallicity sensitivity parameter"" for an old
stellar population at solar metallicity to younger clusters of different
metallicities. We find that indices at low metallicity are generally more age
sensitive than at high metallicity. Our aim is to provide a robust and reliable
tool for the interpretation of star cluster spectra becoming available from 10m
class telescopes in a large variety of galaxies: metal-rich & metal-poor,
starburst, post-burst, and dynamically young. We test our analysis tool using
observations from various authors for Galactic and M31 GCs, for which reliable
age and metallicity determinations are available in the literature, and discuss
in how far the observational availability of various subsets of Lick indices
affects the results. For M31 GCs, we discuss the influence of non-solar
abundance ratios on our results.",2006-05-24T15:52:50Z
"Astrochemical confirmation of the rapid evolution of massive YSOs and
  explanation for the inferred ages of hot cores","Aims. To understand the roles of infall and protostellar evolution on the
envelopes of massive young stellar objects (YSOs).
  Methods. The chemical evolution of gas and dust is traced, including infall
and realistic source evolution. The temperatures are determined
self-consistently. Both ad/desorption of ices using recent laboratory
temperature-programmed-desorption measurements are included.
  Results. The observed water abundance jump near 100 K is reproduced by an
evaporation front which moves outward as the luminosity increases. Ion-molecule
reactions produce water below 100 K. The age of the source is constrained to t
\~ 8 +/- 4 x 10^4 yrs since YSO formation. It is shown that the chemical
age-dating of hot cores at ~ few x 10^3 - 10^4 yr and the disappearance of hot
cores on a timescale of ~ 10^5 yr is a natural consequence of infall in a
dynamic envelope and protostellar evolution. Dynamical structures of ~ 350AU
such as disks should contain most of the complex second generation species. The
assumed order of desorption kinetics does not affect these results.",2006-05-15T19:58:48Z
Sub-milliarcsecond Imaging of SgrA* and M87,"We present and discuss new result from mm-VLBI observations of M87 and SgrA*,
using the Global mm-VLBI array (GMVA). New 3mm-VLBI images of the inner jet of
M87 are presented, showing details with a spatial resolution down to 15
Schwarzschild radii. This resolution corresponds to a similar spatial
resolution (in terms of R_s) obtained for Sgr A*. We discuss existing and new
size determinations for this source provided by mm-VLBI at wavelengths of 3, 2,
and 1.4 mm. With respect to the morphological difference between Sgr A* and M87
(the latter exhibits a long jet), a comparison of the sub-milliarcsecond
structures seen with mm-VLBI may lead to a better understanding of the
astro-physical processes acting in the vicinity of super-massive black holes.",2006-07-05T14:14:46Z
"On Iron Enrichment, Star Formation, and Type Ia Supernovae in Galaxy
  Clusters","The nature of star formation and Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) in galaxies in the
field and in rich galaxy clusters are contrasted by juxtaposing the build-up of
heavy metals in the universe inferred from observed star formation and
supernovae rate histories with data on the evolution of Fe abundances in the
intracluster medium (ICM). Models for the chemical evolution of Fe in these
environments are constructed, subject to observational constraints, for this
purpose. While models with a mean delay for SNIa of 3 Gyr and standard initial
mass function (IMF) are consistent with observations in the field, cluster Fe
enrichment immediately tracks a rapid, top-heavy phase of star formation --
although transport of Fe into the ICM may be more prolonged and star formation
likely continues to redshifts <1. The source of this prompt enrichment is Type
II supernovae (SNII) yielding at least 0.1 solar masses per explosion (if the
SNIa rate normalization is scaled down from its value in the field according to
the relative number of candidate progenitor stars in the 3-8 solar mass range)
and/or SNIa explosions with short delay times associated with the rapid star
formation mode. Star formation is >3 times more efficient in rich clusters than
in the field, mitigating the overcooling problem in numerical cluster
simulations. Both the fraction of baryons cycled through stars, and the
fraction of the total present-day stellar mass in the form of stellar remnants,
are substantially greater in clusters than in the field.",2006-05-04T22:00:09Z
"Spitzer Space Telescope Infrared Imaging and Spectroscopy of the Crab
  Nebula","We present 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, 24, and 70 micron images of the Crab Nebula
obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope IRAC and MIPS cameras, Low- and
High-resolution Spitzer IRS spectra of selected positions within the nebula,
and a near-infrared ground-based image made in the light of [Fe II]1.644
micron. The 8.0 micron image, made with a bandpass that includes [Ar II]7.0
micron, resembles the general morphology of visible H-alpha and near-IR [Fe II]
line emission, while the 3.6 and 4.5 micron images are dominated by continuum
synchrotron emission. The 24 micron and 70 micron images show enhanced emission
that may be due to line emission or the presence of a small amount of warm dust
in the nebula on the order of less than 1% of a solar mass. The ratio of the
3.6 and 4.5 micron images reveals a spatial variation in the synchrotron power
law index ranging from approximately 0.3 to 0.8 across the nebula. Combining
this information with optical and X-ray synchrotron images, we derive a
broadband spectrum that reflects the superposition of the flatter spectrum jet
and torus with the steeper diffuse nebula, and suggestions of the expected
pileup of relativistic electrons just before the exponential cutoff in the
X-ray. The pulsar, and the associated equatorial toroid and polar jet
structures seen in Chandra and HST images (Hester et al. 2002) can be
identified in all of the IRAC images. We present the IR photometry of the
pulsar. The forbidden lines identified in the high resolution IR spectra are
all double due to Doppler shifts from the front and back of the expanding
nebula and give an expansion velocity of approximately 1264 km/s.",2006-06-13T19:18:14Z
Mergers of Binary Compact Objects,"We work out the effects of hypercritical accretion, which transfers mass from
the secondary to the primary (first-born) neutron star (NS) in a binary,
showing that the mass of the primary would end up 0.6 M_sun greater than the
secondary NS in contradiction with the very nearly equal masses of the two NS's
in binaries measured to date. We discuss that the primary NS evolves into a
low-mass black-hole (LMBH) due to the hypercritical accretion. Using a flat
distribution in the mass ratio q (q = M_secondary/M_primary), we calculated a
ratio of LMBH-NS and NS-NS systems to be 5, in rough agreement with
Pinsonneault and Stanek (2006). These authors emphasize the importance of
""twins"", which we discuss. The two NS's in the twins would be close in mass and
further increase the number of mergings.",2006-07-19T14:35:04Z
"Velocity dispersion, mass and the luminosity function of the fossil
  cluster RX J1416.4+2315","We study the properties of the fossil cluster RX J1416.4+2315 through g' and
i'-band imaging and spectroscopy of 25 member galaxies. The system is at a mean
redshift of 0.137 and has a velocity dispersion of 584 km s^-1. Superimposed
onto one quadrant of the cluster field there is a group of five galaxies at a
mean redshift of 0.131, which, if included as part of the cluster, increases
the velocity dispersion to 846 km/s. The central object of RX J1416.4+2315 is a
normal elliptical galaxy, with no cD envelope. The luminosity function of the
system, estimated by the number counts, and statistical background correction,
in the range -22.6< M_g'< -16.6, is well fitted by a Schechter function with
M_g'^* = -21.2 +/- 0.8 and alpha = -1.2 +/- 0.2 (H_0 = 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1,
Omega_M=0.3, Omega_Lambda=0.7). The luminosity function obtained from the
spectroscopically confirmed members in both g' and i' bands agrees with the
photometric results. The mass of the system, M 0.9 \times 10^14 h^-1_70 M_sun,
its M/L of 445 h_70 M_sun/L_B_sun and L_X of 11 10^43 h^-2_70 ergs s^-1
(bolometric) suggest that this system is the second example of known fossil
cluster, after RX J1552.2+2013, confirmed in the literature.",2006-03-27T15:52:08Z
"Revised WMAP constraints on neutrino masses and other extensions of the
  minimal $Λ$CDM model","Recently, two issues concerning the three-year WMAP likelihood code were
pointed out. On large angular scales ($l \lesssim 30$), a sub-optimal
likelihood approximation resulted in a small power excess. On small angular
scales ($l \gtrsim 300$), over-subtraction of unresolved point sources produced
a small power deficit. For a minimal six-parameter cosmological model, these
two effects conspired to decrease the value of $n_s$ by $\sim 0.7 \sigma$. In
this paper, we study the change in preferred parameter ranges for more
extensive cosmological models, including running of $n_s$, massive neutrinos,
curvature, and the equation of state for dark energy. We also include
large-scale structure and supernova data in our analysis. We find that the
parameter ranges for $\alpha_s$, $\Omega_k$ and $w$ are not much altered by the
modified analysis. For massive neutrinos the upper limit on the sum of the
neutrino masses decreases from $M_\nu < 1.90$eV to $M_\nu < 1.57$eV when using
the modified WMAP code and WMAP data only. We also find that the shift of $n_s$
to higher values is quite robust to these extensions of the minimal
cosmological model.",2006-08-01T11:59:13Z
"Causes of Observed Long-Periodic Variations of the Polarization at Polar
  Regions of Jupiter","Data of 23-years of Jupiter polarimetric observations (1981- 2004) have been
reprocessed using new improved technique. The data from other observers have
been added to the analysis (1971-74). Anticorrelation between asymmetry of
polarization and insolation has been found. The mechanism of influence of
seasons changing (through temperature variations) on north-south asymmetry of
polarization formation has been proposed. Also a possibility of existence of
influence of solar cosmic rays flux on polarization value is noted.",2006-07-10T14:30:22Z
"Jet-dominated advective systems: radio and X-ray luminosity dependence
  on the accretion rate","We present a novel method to measure the accretion rate of radio emitting
X-ray binaries (XRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) independently of the
X-ray luminosity. The radio emission of the jet is used as a tracer for the
accretion rate and is normalised using sources of known accretion rates: island
state neutron stars and efficiently radiating black holes close to a state
transition. We show that the radio power in black holes and neutron stars is
comparable for a given mass accretion rate and verify empirically the assumed
analytic scaling of the radio luminosity with accretion rate. As our accretion
measure is independent of the X-ray luminosities, we can search for radiatively
inefficient accretion in black holes by comparing the X-ray luminosities with
the accretion rate in XRBs and AGN. While the X-ray luminosity of efficiently
radiating objects scales linearly with accretion rate, the scaling of hard
state black holes is quadratical, in agreement with theoretical models. We show
that the turnover from the inefficient quadratic scaling to the linear scaling
has to occur at accretion rates of 1-10 % Eddington both in XRBs and AGN. The
comparison of both accretion states supports the idea that in a black hole in
the hard state some accretion power is advected into the black hole while the
jet power exceeds the X-ray luminosity: these are therefore jet-dominated
advective systems.",2006-03-27T15:51:07Z
Supernova 2006aj and the associated X-Ray Flash 060218,"We have studied the afterglow of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) of February 18,
2006. This is a nearby long GRB, with a very low peak energy, and is therefore
classified as an X-ray Flash (XRF). XRF 060218 is clearly associated with a
supernova -- dubbed SN 2006aj. We present early spectra for SN 2006aj as well
as optical lightcurves reaching out to 50 days past explosion. Our optical
lightcurves define the rise times, the lightcurve shapes and the absolute
magnitudes in the U, V and R bands, and we compare these data with data for
other relevant supernovae. SN 2006aj evolved quite fast, somewhat similarly to
SN 2002ap, but not as fast as SN 1994I. Our spectra show the evolution of the
supernova over the peak, when the U-band portion of the spectrum rapidly fades
due to extensive line blanketing. We compare to similar spectra of very
energetic Type Ic supernovae. Our first spectra are earlier than spectra for
any other GRB-SN. The spectrum taken 12 days after burst in the rest frame is
similar to somewhat later spectra of both SN 1998bw and SN 2003dh, implying a
rapid early evolution. This is consistent with the fast lightcurve.
  From the narrow emission lines from the host galaxy we derive a redshift of
z=0.0331+-0.0007. This makes XRF 060218 the second closest gamma-ray burst
detected. The flux of these emission lines indicate a high-excitation state,
and a modest metallicity and star formation rate of the host galaxy.",2006-03-20T13:46:38Z
High resolution infrared spectroscopy of the old open cluster NGC6791,"We report abundance analysis for 6 M giant members of the old open cluster
NGC6791, based on infrared spectroscopy (1.5-1.8 micron) at R=25,000, using the
NIRSPEC spectrograph at the Keck II telescope. We find the iron abundance
<[Fe/H]>= +0.35 +/- 0.02$, confirming the super solar metallicity of this
cluster derived from optical medium-high resolution spectroscopy. We also
measure C, O and other alpha element abundances, finding roughly solar
[alpha/Fe] and <[C/Fe]> = -0.35. Our approach constrains [O/Fe] especially
well, based on the measurement of a number of OH lines near 1.6micron; we find
[O/Fe]=-0.07 +/-0.03. The Solar alpha enhancement is in contrast to the
composition of similar stars in the Galactic bulge. We also find low
12C/13C~10, confirming the presence of extra-mixing processes during the red
giant phase of evolution, up to super solar metallicities.",2006-04-03T14:20:08Z

"Three-Dimensional Simulations of Spherical Accretion Flows with
  Small-Scale Magnetic Fields","Spherical (nonrotating) accretion flows with small-scale magnetic fields have
been investigated using three-dimensional, time-dependent MHD simulations.
These simulations have been designed to model high-resolution (quasi) steady
accretion flows in a wedge computational domain that represents a small
fraction of the full spherical domain. Subsonic and supersonic
(super-fast-magnetosonic) accretion flows have been considered. Two accretion
regimes have been studied: conservative, or radiatively inefficient, and
nonconservative, in which the heat released in magnetic reconnections is
completely lost. The flows in both regimes are turbulent. They show the
flattened radial density profiles and reduction of the accretion velocities and
mass accretion rates in comparison with hydrodynamic Bondi flows. In the
conservative regime, the turbulence is more intensive and supported mostly by
thermal convection. In the nonconservative regime, the turbulence is less
intensive and supported by magnetic buoyancy and various magnetic interactions.
We have concluded that steady, supersonic spherical accretion cannot be
developed in the presence of small-scale magnetic fields.",2006-06-08T15:01:44Z
"Study of the spring and autumn daemon-flux maxima at the Baksan Neutrino
  Observatory","Detection of daemons in low-background conditions in September 2005 and March
2006 has provided evidence for the expected to occur at that times maxima in
the flux of daemons with V ~ 10-15 km s-1, which hit the Earth from near-Earth,
almost circular heliocentric orbits. The ability of some FEU-167-1 PM tubes
with a thicker inner Al coating to detect directly daemon passage through them
has also been demonstrated, an effect increasing ~100-fold the detector
efficiency. As a result, the daemon flux recorded at the maxima was increased
from ~10-9 to ~10-7 cm-2 s-1. The intensity and direction of the flux during
maxima depend on the time of day and latitude of observations (therefore,
synchronous measurements in the Northern and Southern Earth's hemispheres are
desirable). All the experimental results obtained either support the
conclusions following from the daemon paradigm or find a simple interpretation
within it.",2006-07-04T10:48:59Z
Measuring dark energy properties with 3D cosmic shear,"We present parameter estimation forecasts for present and future 3D cosmic
shear surveys. We demonstrate that, in conjunction with results from cosmic
microwave background (CMB) experiments, the properties of dark energy can be
estimated with very high precision with large-scale, fully 3D weak lensing
surveys. In particular, a 5-band, 10,000 square degree ground-based survey to a
median redshift of zm=0.7 could achieve 1-$\sigma$ marginal statistical errors,
in combination with the constraints expected from the CMB Planck Surveyor, of
$\Delta$w0=0.108 and $\Delta$wa=0.099 where we parameterize w by
w(a)=w0+wa(1-a) where a is the scale factor. Such a survey is achievable with a
wide-field camera on a 4 metre class telescope. The error on the value of w at
an intermediate pivot redshift of z=0.368 is constrained to
$\Delta$w(z=0.368)=0.0175. We compare and combine the 3D weak lensing
constraints with the cosmological and dark energy parameters measured from
planned Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) and supernova Type Ia experiments,
and find that 3D weak lensing significantly improves the marginalized errors. A
combination of 3D weak lensing, CMB and BAO experiments could achieve
$\Delta$w0=0.037 and $\Delta$wa=0.099. Fully 3D weak shear analysis avoids the
loss of information inherent in tomographic binning, and we show that the
sensitivity to systematic errors is much less. In conjunction with the fact
that the physics of lensing is very soundly based, this analysis demonstrates
that deep, wide-angle 3D weak lensing surveys are extremely promising for
measuring dark energy properties.",2006-06-23T19:36:01Z
On the Evolutionary History of Stars and their Fossil Mass and Light,"The total extragalactic background radiation can be an important test of the
global star formation history (SFH). Using direct observational estimates of
the SFH, along with standard assumptions about the initial mass function (IMF),
we calculate the total extragalactic background radiation and the observed
stellar density today. We show that plausible SFHs allow a significant range in
each quantity, but that their ratio is very tightly constrained. Current
estimates of the stellar mass and extragalactic background are difficult to
reconcile, as long as the IMF is fixed to the Salpeter slope above 1 Msun. The
joint confidence interval of these two quantities only agrees with that
determined from the allowed range of SFH fits at the 3-sigma level, and for our
best-fit values the discrepancy is about a factor of two. Alternative energy
sources that contribute to the background, such as active galactic nuclei
(AGN), Population III stars, or decaying particles, appear unlikely to resolve
the discrepancy. However, changes to the IMF allow plausible solutions to the
background problem. The simplest is an average IMF with an increased
contribution from stars around 1.5--4 Msun. A ``paunchy'' IMF of this sort
could emerge as a global average if low mass star formation is suppressed in
galaxies experiencing rapid starbursts. Such an IMF is consistent with
observations of star-forming regions, and would help to reconcile the fossil
record of star formation with the directly observed SFH.",2006-04-26T19:49:08Z
"Asteroseismic inferences on GW Vir variable stars in the frame of new PG
  1159 evolutionary models","An adiabatic, nonradial pulsation study of GW Vir stars is presented. The
pulsation calculations are based on PG1159 evolutionary sequences with
different stellar massess artificially derived from a full evolutionary
sequence of 0.5895 Mo that has been computed taking into account the
evolutionary history of the progenitor star. The artificial sequences were
constructed by appropriately scaling the stellar mass of the 0.5895 Mo sequence
well before the models reach the low-luminosity, high-gravity stage of the GW
Vir domain. We compute g-mode pulsation periods appropriate to GW Vir variable
stars. The implications for the mode-trapping properties of our PG 1159 models
are discussed at length. We found that the mode-trapping features
characterizing our PG 1159 models are mostly fixed by the stepped shape of the
core chemical profile left by prior convective overshooting. This is
particularly true at least for the range of periods observed in GW Vir stars.
In addition, we make asteroseismic inferences about the internal structure of
the GW Vir stars PG 1159-035, PG 2131+066, PG 1707+427 and PG 0122+200.",2006-03-27T17:25:26Z
Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect in the era of precision cosmology,"Recent detections of the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect through the
correlation of the cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropy with
traces of large scale structure provided independent evidence for the expansion
of the universe being dominated by something other than matter. Even with
perfect data, statistical errors will limit the accuracy of such measurements
to worse than 10%. On the other hand, the extraordinary sensitivity of the ISW
effect to the details of structure formation should help to make up for the
lack of precision. In these conference proceedings I discuss the extent to
which future ISW measurements can help in testing the physics responsible for
the observed cosmic acceleration.",2006-06-26T14:47:37Z
"Formation of Globular Clusters in Hierarchical Cosmology: ART and
  Science","We test the hypothesis that globular clusters form in supergiant molecular
clouds within high-redshift galaxies. Numerical simulations demonstrate that
such large, dense, and cold gas clouds assemble naturally in current
hierarchical models of galaxy formation. These clouds are enriched with heavy
elements from earlier stars and could produce star clusters in a similar way to
nearby molecular clouds. The masses and sizes of the model clusters are in
excellent agreement with the observations of young massive clusters. Do these
model clusters evolve into globular clusters that we see in our and external
galaxies? In order to study their dynamical evolution, we calculate the orbits
of model clusters using the outputs of the cosmological simulation of a Milky
Way-sized galaxy. We find that at present the orbits are isotropic in the inner
50 kpc of the Galaxy and preferentially radial at larger distances. All
clusters located outside 10 kpc from the center formed in the now-disrupted
satellite galaxies. The spatial distribution of model clusters is spheroidal,
with a power-law density profile consistent with observations. The combination
of two-body scattering, tidal shocks, and stellar evolution results in the
evolution of the cluster mass function from an initial power law to the
observed log-normal distribution. However, not all initial conditions and not
all evolution scenarios are consistent with the observed mass function.",2006-06-07T20:00:28Z
Structure formation in the quasispherical Szekeres model,"Structure formation in the Szekeres model is investigated. Since the Szekeres
model is an inhomogeneous model with no symmetries, it is possible to examine
the interaction of neighboring structures and its impact on the growth of a
density contrast. It has been found that the mass flow from voids to clusters
enhances the growth of the density contrast. In the model presented here, the
growth of the density contrast is almost 8 times faster than in the linear
approach.",2006-04-24T12:08:38Z
Nuclear Star Clusters in Edge-on Galaxies,"From observations of edge-on, late-type galaxies, we present morphological
evidence that some nuclear star clusters have experienced in situ star
formation. We find three nuclear clusters that, viewed from the edge-on
perspective, have both a compact disk-like component and a spheroidal
component. In each cluster, the disk components are closely aligned with the
major axis of the host galaxy and have bluer colors than the spheroidal
components. We spectroscopically verify that one of the observed multiple
component clusters has multiple generations of stars. These observations lead
us to suggest a formation mechanism for nuclear star clusters, in which stars
episodically form in compact nuclear disks, and then lose angular momentum,
eventually forming an older spheroid.",2006-06-02T21:28:37Z
Global Predictions of the Universal Constant of Expansion,"The new spatial condensation cosmological theory, based on the new universal
constant of expansion, kappa = G Rho t^2 = 3/(32 Pi), is used to predict
measurements of the supernova Ia data with no acceleration of the expansion
rate of the universe. That goal was accomplished with the key assumption that
radiation travels on great circles on the surface of the supporting 4-D ball
towards the detector at the compounded velocity of Vc = Hr - c. The radiation
has traveled great distances from emission to measurement in the expanding
universe and is exactly suited to test the global predictions of a cosmological
theory. Problems of the current big bang theory are discussed. It will be shown
that a new method of analyzing the data does indeed show the simplicity and
consistency of the new theory in contrast to the old Friedmann big bang model.",2006-06-15T02:21:21Z
FISICA: The Florida Image Slicer for Infrared Cosmology & Astrophysics,"We report on the design, fabrication, and on-sky performance of the Florida
Image Slicer for Infrared Cosmology and Astrophysics (FISICA)- a
fully-cryogenic all-reflective image-slicing integral field unit for the
FLAMINGOS near-infrared spectrograph. Designed to accept input beams near f/15,
FISICA with FLAMINGOS provides R \sim 1300 spectra over a 16x33-arcsec
field-of-view on the Cassegrain f/15 focus of the KPNO 4-meter telescope, or a
6x12-arcsec field-of-view on the Nasmyth or Bent Cassegrain foci of the Gran
Telescopio Canarias 10.4-meter telescope. FISICA accomplishes this using three
sets of ""monolithic"" powered mirror arrays, each with 22 mirrored surfaces cut
into a single piece of aluminum. We review the optical and opto-mechanical
design and fabrication of FISICA, as well as laboratory test results for FISICA
integrated with the FLAMINGOS instrument. Finally, we present performance
results from observations with FISICA at the KPNO 4-m telescope and comparisons
of FISICA performance to other available IFUs on 4-m to 8-m-class telescopes.",2006-04-27T14:01:34Z
"Spitzer/IRAC and ISOCAM/CVF insights on the origin of the Near to Mid-IR
  Galactic diffuse emission","We measure IRAC colors of extended emission in several fields covering a
range of Galactic latitudes and longitudes outside of star forming regions. We
determine the nature of the Galactic diffuse emission in Spitzer/IRAC images by
combining them with spectroscopic data. We show that PAH features make the
emission in the IRAC 5.8 and 8.0 $\mu$m channels, whereas the 3.3 $\mu$m
feature represents only 20 to 50% of the IRAC 3.6 $\mu$m channel. A NIR
continuum is necessary to account for IRAC 4.5 $\mu$m emission and the
remaining fraction of the IRAC 3.6 $\mu$m emission. This continuum cannot be
accounted by scattered light. It represents 9% of the total power absorbed by
PAHs and 120% of the interstellar UV photon flux. The 3.3 $\mu$m feature is
observed to vary from field-to-field with respect to the IRAC 8.0 $\mu$m
channel. The continuum and 3.3 $\mu$m feature intensities are not correlated.
We present model calculations which relate our measurements of the PAHs
spectral energy distribution to the particles size and ionization state. Cation
and neutral PAHs emission properties are inferred empirically from
\object{NGC7023} observations. PAHs caracteristics are best constrained in a
line of sight towards the inner Galaxy, dominated by the Cold Neutral Medium
phase : we find that the PAH cation fraction is about 50% and that their mean
size is about 60 carbon atoms. A significant field-to-field dispersion in the
PAH mean size, from 40 to 80 carbon atoms, is necessary to account for the
observed variations in the 3.3 $\mu$m feature intensity relative to the IRAC
8.0 $\mu$m flux. However, one cannot be secure about the feature interpretation
as long as the continuum origin remains unclear.",2006-04-11T12:58:37Z
X-ray Spectral Study of the Photoionized Stellar Wind in Vela~X-1,"We present results from quantitative modeling and spectral analysis of the
high mass X-ray binary Vela X-1 obtained with the Chandra HETGS. The spectra
exhibit emission lines from H-like and He-like ions driven by photoionization,
as well as fluorescent emission lines from several elements in lower charge
states. In order to interpret and make full use of the high-quality data, we
have developed a simulator, which calculates the ionization and thermal
structure of a stellar wind photoionized by an X-ray source, and performs Monte
Carlo simulations of X-ray photons propagating through the wind. The emergent
spectra are then computed as a function of the viewing angle accurately
accounting for photon transport in three dimensions including dynamics. From
comparisons of the observed spectra with the simulation results, we are able to
find the ionization structure and the geometrical distribution of material in
Vela X-1 that can reproduce the observed spectral line intensities and
continuum shapes at different orbital phases remarkably well. It is found that
a large fraction of X-ray emission lines from highly ionized ions are formed in
the region between the neutron star and the companion star. We also find that
the fluorescent X-ray lines must be produced in at least three distinct regions
--(1)the extended stellar wind, (2)reflection off the stellar photosphere, and
(3)in a distribution of dense material partially covering and possibly trailing
the neutron star, which may be associated with an accretion wake. Finally, from
detailed analysis of the emission lines, we demonstrate that the stellar wind
is affected by X-ray photoionization.",2006-07-03T14:00:47Z
Mapping and Mass Measurement of the Cold Dust in NGC 205 with Spitzer,"We present observations at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8, 24, 70 & 160um of NGC 205, the
dwarf elliptical companion of M31, obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope.
The point sources subtracted images at 8 and 24um display a complex and
fragmented infrared emission coming from both very small dust particles and
larger grains. The extended dust emission is spatially concentrated in three
main emission regions, seen at all wavelengths from 8 to 160um. These regions
lie approximately along NGC 205's semi-major axis and range from ~100 to 300 pc
in size. Based on our mid-to-far infrared flux density measurements alone, we
derive a total dust mass estimate of the order of 3.2e4 solar masses, mainly at
a temperature of ~20K. The gas mass associated with this component matches the
predicted mass returned by the dying stars from the last burst of star
formation in NGC 205 (~0.5 Gyr ago). Analysis of the Spitzer data combined with
previous 1.1mm observations over a small central region or ""Core'' (18""
diameter), suggest the presence of very cold (~12K) dust and a dust mass about
sixteen times higher than is estimated from the Spitzer measurements alone.
Assuming a gas to dust mass ratio of 100, these two datasets, i.e.with and
without the millimeter observations, suggest a total gas mass range of 3.2e6 to
5e7 solar masses.",2006-04-10T01:30:36Z
"Long gamma-ray bursts and core-collapse supernovae have different
  environments","When massive stars exhaust their fuel they collapse and often produce the
extraordinarily bright explosions known as core-collapse supernovae. On
occasion, this stellar collapse also powers an even more brilliant relativistic
explosion known as a long-duration gamma-ray burst. One would then expect that
long gamma-ray bursts and core-collapse supernovae should be found in similar
galactic environments. Here we show that this expectation is wrong. We find
that the long gamma-ray bursts are far more concentrated on the very brightest
regions of their host galaxies than are the core-collapse supernovae.
Furthermore, the host galaxies of the long gamma-ray bursts are significantly
fainter and more irregular than the hosts of the core-collapse supernovae.
Together these results suggest that long-duration gamma-ray bursts are
associated with the most massive stars and may be restricted to galaxies of
limited chemical evolution. Our results directly imply that long gamma-ray
bursts are relatively rare in galaxies such as our own Milky Way.",2006-03-20T19:08:08Z
"Magnetic burial and the harmonic content of millisecond oscillations in
  thermonuclear X-ray bursts","Matter accreting onto the magnetic poles of a neutron star spreads under
gravity towards the magnetic equator, burying the polar magnetic field and
compressing it into a narrow equatorial belt. Steady-state, Grad-Shafranov
calculations with a self-consistent mass-flux distribution (and a
semi-quantitative treatment of Ohmic diffusion) show that, for $\Ma \gtrsim
10^{-5}\Msun$, the maximum field strength and latitudinal half-width of the
equatorial magnetic belt are $B_{\rm max} = 5.6\times 10^{15}
(\Ma/10^{-4}\Msun)^{0.32}$ G and $\Delta\theta = \max[3^{\circ}
(\Ma/10^{-4}\Msun)^{-1.5},3^{\circ} (\Ma/10^{-4}\Msun)^{0.5}(\dot{M}_{\rm
a}/10^{-8}\Msun {\rm yr}^{-1})^{-0.5}]$ respectively, where $\Ma$ is the total
accreted mass and $\dot{M}_{\rm a}$ is the accretion rate. It is shown that the
belt prevents north-south heat transport by conduction, convection, radiation,
and ageostrophic shear. This may explain why millisecond oscillations observed
in the tails of thermonuclear (type I) X-ray bursts in low-mass X-ray binaries
are highly sinusoidal: the thermonuclear flame is sequestered in the magnetic
hemisphere which ignites first. The model is also consistent with the
occasional occurrence of closely spaced pairs of bursts. Time-dependent,
ideal-magnetohydrodynamic simulations confirm that the equatorial belt is not
disrupted by Parker and interchange instabilities.",2006-07-11T05:28:59Z
"Resolved Massive Star Clusters in the Milky Way and its Satellites:
  Brightness Profiles and a Catalogue of Fundamental Parameters","[Abridged]: We present a database of structural and dynamical properties for
153 spatially resolved star clusters (50 ""young massive clusters"" and 103 old
globulars) in the Milky Way, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, and the
Fornax dwarf spheroidal. This database complements and extends others in the
literature, such as those of Harris, and Mackey & Gilmore. By fitting a number
of models to the clusters' density profiles, we derive various characteristic
surface brightnesses and radii; central potentials, velocity dispersions, and
escape velocities; total luminosities, masses, and binding energies;
phase-space densities and relaxation timescales; and ``kappa-space''
parameters. Population-synthesis models are used to predict intrinsic (B-V)
colors, reddenings, and V-band mass-to-light ratios for the same 153 clusters
plus another 63 globulars in the Milky Way, and we compare these predictions to
the observed quantities where available. These results are intended to serve as
the basis for future investigations of structural correlations and the
fundamental plane of massive star clusters, including especially comparisons
between the systemic properties of young and old clusters. We also address the
question of what structural model fits each cluster best, and argue that the
extended halos known to characterize many Magellanic Cloud clusters may be
examples of the generic envelope structure of self-gravitating star clusters,
not just transient features associated strictly with young age.",2006-05-04T19:23:16Z
"Lensing signals in the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field using all 2nd order shape
  deformations","The long exposure times of the HST Ultra-Deep Field plus the use of an
empirically derived position-dependent PSF, have enabled us to measure a
cardioid/displacement distortion map coefficient as well as improving upon the
sextupole map coefficient. We confirmed that curved background galaxies are
clumped on the same angular scale as found in the HST Deep Field North. The new
cardioid/displacement map coefficient is strongly correlated to a product of
the sextupole and quadrupole coefficients. One would expect to see such a
correlation from fits to background galaxies with quadrupole and sextupole
moments. Events that depart from this correlation are expected to arise from
map coefficient changes due to lensing, and several galaxy subsets selected
using this criteria are indeed clumped.",2006-07-02T04:51:19Z
"Thermal Infrared Constraint to a Planetary Companion of Vega with the
  MMT Adaptive Optics System","Vega may have a massive companion in a wide orbit, as evidenced by structure
in its cold dust debris. We have tested this hypothesis by direct imaging with
adaptive optics in the M band. The observations were made with a newly
commissioned thermal infrared camera, Clio, on the 6.5 MMT AO system with
low-background deformable secondary. The observations constrain a planet to be
less than 7 M$_J$ at the approximate position angle expected from the dust
structure and at a radius $>$ 20AU (2.5 arcsec) . This result is more stringent
than similar previous near-infrared observations of Vega, that achieve limits
of 20 and 10 M$_J$ at separations of 7 arcsec. The higher sensitivity is due
both to the more favorable contrast of gas giant planets at M band and to the
higher Strehl and more stable point spread function at longer wavelengths.
Future L' or M band observations could provide a powerful approach for wide
separation planet detection, especially for cooler, and thus older or less
massive planets. The natural best targets are nearby stars where planets in the
range of 5-15 M$_J$ and as old as several Gyr are expected to be detectable
with this technique.",2006-06-06T21:19:53Z
"The Hubble Deep Field North SCUBA Super-map IV - Characterizing
  submillimetre galaxies using deep Spitzer imaging","We present SEDs, Spitzer colours, and IR luminosities for 850 micron selected
galaxies in the GOODS-N field. Using the deep Spitzer Legacy images and new
data and reductions of the VLA-HDF radio data, we find statistically secure
counterparts for 60 per cent (21/35) of our submm sample, and identify
tentative counterparts for another 12 objects. This is the largest sample of
submm galaxies with statistically secure counterparts detected in the radio and
with Spitzer. We find that in most cases the 850 micron emission is dominated
by a single 24 micron source. A composite rest-frame SED shows that the submm
sources peak at longer wavelengths than those of local ULIRGs of the same
luminosity and therefore appear to be cooler. The SEDs of submm galaxies are
also different from those of their high redshift neighbours, the near-IR
selected BzK galaxies, whose mid-IR to radio SEDs are more like those of local
ULIRGs. Using 24 micron. 850 micron and 1.4 GHz observations, we fit templates
that span the mid-IR through radio to derived the integrated IR luminosity of
the submm galaxies. By themselves, 24 micron and radio fluxes are able to
predict LIR reasonably well because they are relatively insensitive to
temperature. However, the submm flux by itself consistently overpredicts LIR
when using spectral templates which obey the local ULIRG temperature-luminosity
relation. The shorter Spitzer wavelengths sample the stellar bump at the
redshifts of the submm sources, and we find that the Spitzer photometry alone
provides a model independent estimate of the redshift. Using X-ray and mid-IR
data, only 5 per cent of our secure counterparts show strong evidence for an
active galactic nucleus dominating the IR luminosity.",2006-05-22T20:04:42Z
Astrophysics in 2005,"We bring you, as usual, the Sun and Moon and stars, plus some galaxies and a

class of gamma-ray bursts, and the Deep Impact on Comet 9P/ Tempel 1), some
long (the age of the universe, which will be found to have the Earth at its

the evolution of star formation rates with redshift.",2006-06-27T18:52:46Z
"SCUBA polarisation observations of the magnetic fields in the prestellar
  cores L1498 and L1517B","We have mapped linearly polarized dust emission from the prestellar cores
L1498 and L1517B with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) using the
Submillimetre Common User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) and its polarimeter SCUBAPOL
at a wavelength of 850um. We use these measurements to determine the
plane-of-sky magnetic field orientation in the cores. In L1498 we see a
magnetic field across the peak of the core that lies at an offset of 19 degrees
to the short axis of the core. This is similar to the offsets seen in previous
observations of prestellar cores. To the southeast of the peak, in the
filamentary tail of the core, we see that the magnetic field has rotated to lie
almost parallel to the long axis of the filament. We hypothesise that the field
in the core may have decoupled from the field in the filament that connects the
core to the rest of the cloud. We use the Chandrasekhar-Fermi (CF) method to
measure the plane-of-sky field strength in the core of L1498 to be 10 +/- 7 uG.
  In L1517B we see a more gradual turn in the field direction from the northern
part of the core to the south. This appears to follow a twist in the filament
in which the core is buried, with the field staying at a roughly constant 25
degree offset to the short axis of the filament, also consistent with previous
observations of prestellar cores. We again use the CF method and calculate the
magnetic field strength in L1517B also to be 30 +/- 10 uG. Both cores appear to
be roughly virialised. Comparison with our previous work on somewhat denser
cores shows that, for the denser cores, thermal and non-thermal (including
magnetic) support are approximately equal, while for the lower density cores
studied here, thermal support dominates.",2006-03-29T09:57:28Z
Is Radiation of Quantized Black Holes Observable?,"If primordial black holes (PBH) saturate the present upper limit on the dark

this radiation. This conclusion is not in conflict with the upper limits on the
PBH evaporation rate.",2006-04-01T05:25:06Z
Absolute timing of the Crab Pulsar at optical wavelengths with STJs,"We have observed the Crab Pulsar in the optical with S-Cam, an instrument
based on Superconducting Tunneling Junctions (STJs) with $\mu$s time
resolution. Our aim was to study the delay between the radio and optical pulse.
The Crab Pulsar was observed three times over a time span of almost 7 years, on
two different locations, using three different versions of the instrument, and
using two different GPS units. We consistently find that the optical peak leads
the radio peak by 49$\pm$90, 254$\pm$170, and 291$\pm$100 $\mu$s. On assumption
of a constant optical lead, the weighted-average value is $\sim$170 $\mu$s, or
when rejecting (based on a perhaps questionable radio ephemeris) the first
measurement, 273$\pm$100 $\mu$s.",2006-06-07T12:08:14Z
The halo mass function from the dark ages through the present day,"We use an array of high-resolution N-body simulations to determine the mass
function of dark matter haloes at redshifts 10-30. We develop a new method for
compensating for the effects of finite simulation volume that allows us to find
an approximation to the true ``global'' mass function. By simulating a wide
range of volumes at different mass resolution, we calculate the abundance of
haloes of mass 10^{5-12} Msun/h. This enables us to predict accurately the
abundance of the haloes that host the sources that reionize the universe. In
particular, we focus on the small mass haloes (>~10^{5.5-6} Msun/h) likely to
harbour population III stars where gas cools by molecular hydrogen emission,
early galaxies in which baryons cool by atomic hydrogen emission at a virial
temperature of ~10^4K (10^{7.5-8} Msun/h), and massive galaxies that may be
observable at redshift ~10. When we combine our data with simulations that
include high mass halos at low redshift, we find that the best fit to the halo
mass function depends not only on linear overdensity, as is commonly assumed in
analytic models, but also upon the slope of the linear power spectrum at the
scale of the halo mass. The Press-Schechter model gives a poor fit to the halo
mass function in the simulations at all epochs; the Sheth-Tormen model gives a
better match, but still overpredicts the abundance of rare objects at all times
by up to 50%. Finally, we consider the consequences of the recently released
WMAP 3-year cosmological parameters. These lead to much less structure at high
redshift, reducing the number of z=10 ``mini-haloes'' by more than a factor of
two and the number of z=30 galaxy hosts by more than four orders of magnitude.

Annual Modulation of Dark Matter in the Presence of Streams,"In addition to a smooth component of WIMP dark matter in galaxies, there may
be streams of material; the effects of WIMP streams on direct detection
experiments is examined in this paper. The contribution to the count rate due
to the stream cuts off at some characteristic energy. Near this cutoff energy,
the stream contribution to the annual modulation of recoils in the detector is
comparable to that of the thermalized halo, even if the stream represents only
a small portion (~5% or less) of the local halo density. Consequently the total
modulation may be quite different than would be expected for the standard halo
model alone: it may not be cosine-like and can peak at a different date than
expected. The effects of speed, direction, density, and velocity dispersion of
a stream on the modulation are examined. We describe how the observation of a
modulation can be used to determine these stream parameters. Alternatively, the
presence of a dropoff in the recoil spectrum can be used to determine the WIMP
mass if the stream speed is known. The annual modulation of the cutoff energy
together with the annual modulation of the overall signal provide a ""smoking
gun"" for WIMP detection.",2006-07-07T00:20:36Z
The evolutionary state of the southern dense core Cha-MMS1,"Aims: Our goal is to set constraints on the evolutionary state of the dense

molecular line observations carried out with the new submillimeter telescope
APEX. We look for outflow signatures around the dense core and probe its
chemical structure, which we compare to predictions of models of gas-phase
chemistry. We also use the public database of the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST)
to compare Cha-MMS1 with the two Class 0 protostars IRAM 04191 and L1521F,
which are at the same distance. Results: We measure a large deuterium
fractionation for N2H+ (11 +/- 3 %), intermediate between the prestellar core
L1544 and the very young Class 0 protostar L1521F. It is larger than for HCO+
(2.5 +/- 0.9 %), which is probably the result of depletion removing HCO+ from
the high-density inner region. Our CO(3-2) map reveals the presence of a
bipolar outflow driven by the Class I protostar Ced 110 IRS 4 but we do not
find evidence for an outflow powered by Cha-MMS1. We also report the detection
of Cha-MMS1 at 24, 70 and 160 microns by the instrument MIPS of the SST, at a
level nearly an order of magnitude lower than IRAM 04191 and L1521F.
Conclusions: Cha-MMS1 appears to have already formed a compact object, either
the first hydrostatic core at the very end of the prestellar phase, or an
extremely young protostar that has not yet powered any outflow, at the very
beginning of the Class 0 accretion phase.",2006-05-18T14:04:54Z
New algorithms for adaptive optics point-spread function reconstruction,"Context. The knowledge of the point-spread function compensated by adaptive
optics is of prime importance in several image restoration techniques such as
deconvolution and astrometric/photometric algorithms. Wavefront-related data
from the adaptive optics real-time computer can be used to accurately estimate
the point-spread function in adaptive optics observations. The only
point-spread function reconstruction algorithm implemented on astronomical
adaptive optics system makes use of particular functions, named $U\_{ij}$.
These $U\_{ij}$ functions are derived from the mirror modes, and their number
is proportional to the square number of these mirror modes. Aims. We present
here two new algorithms for point-spread function reconstruction that aim at
suppressing the use of these $U\_{ij}$ functions to avoid the storage of a
large amount of data and to shorten the computation time of this PSF
reconstruction. Methods. Both algorithms take advantage of the eigen
decomposition of the residual parallel phase covariance matrix. In the first
algorithm, the use of a basis in which the latter matrix is diagonal reduces
the number of $U\_{ij}$ functions to the number of mirror modes. In the second
algorithm, this eigen decomposition is used to compute phase screens that
follow the same statistics as the residual parallel phase covariance matrix,
and thus suppress the need for these $U\_{ij}$ functions. Results. Our
algorithms dramatically reduce the number of $U\_{ij}$ functions to be computed
for the point-spread function reconstruction. Adaptive optics simulations show
the good accuracy of both algorithms to reconstruct the point-spread function.",2006-06-28T09:44:48Z
Strangeness in Neutron Stars,"It is generally agreed on that the tremendous densities reached in the
centers of neutron stars provide a high-pressure environment in which several
intriguing particles processes may compete with each other. These range from
the generation of hyperons to quark deconfinement to the formation of kaon
condensates and H-matter. There are theoretical suggestions of even more exotic
processes inside neutron stars, such as the formation of absolutely stable
strange quark matter. In the latter event, neutron stars would be largely
composed of strange quark matter possibly enveloped in a thin nuclear crust.
This paper gives a brief overview of these striking physical possibilities with
an emphasis on the role played by strangeness in neutron star matter, which
constitutes compressed baryonic matter at ultra-high baryon number density but
low temperature which is no accessible to relativistic heavy ion collision
experiments.",2006-04-20T06:05:51Z
"Deep Impact : High Resolution Optical Spectroscopy with the ESO VLT and
  the Keck 1 telescope","We report on observations of comet 9P/Tempel 1 carried out before, during,
and after the NASA DEEP IMPACT event (UT July 4), with the optical
spectrometers UVES and HIRES mounted on the telescopes Kueyen of the ESO VLT
(Chile) and Keck 1 on Mauna Kea (Hawaii), respectively. A total observing time
of about 60 hours, distributed over 15 nights around the impact date, allowed
us (i) to find a periodic variation of 1.709 +/- 0.009 day in the CN and NH
flux, explained by the presence of two major active regions; (ii) to derive a
lifetime > ~ 5 x 10^4 s for the parent of the CN radical from a simple modeling
of the CN light curve after the impact; (iii) to follow the gas and dust
spatial profiles evolution during the 4 hours following the impact and derive
the projected velocities (400 m/s and 150 m/s respectively); (iv) to show that
the material released by the impact has the same carbon and nitrogen isotopic
composition as the surface material (12C/13C = 95 +/- 15 and 14N/15N = 145 +/-
20).",2006-03-13T13:46:17Z
Phantom Dark Energy Models with Negative Kinetic Term,"We examine phantom dark energy models derived from a scalar field with a
negative kinetic term for which V(phi) approaches infinity asymptotically. All
such models can be divided into three classes, corresponding to an equation of
state parameter w with asymptotic behavior w -> -1, w -> w_0 < -1, and w ->
infinity. We derive the conditions on the potential V(phi) which lead to each
of these three types of behavior. For models with w -> -1, we derive the
conditions on V(phi) which determine whether or not such models produce a
future big rip. Observational constraints are derived on two classes of these
models: power-law potentials with V(phi) = lambda phi^alpha (with alpha
positive or negative) and exponential potentials of the form V(phi) = beta
e^{lambda phi^alpha}. It is shown that these models spend more time in a state
with Omega_m ~ Omega_phi than do corresponding models with a constant value of
w, thus providing a more satisfactory solution to the coincidence problem.",2006-06-29T19:28:10Z
Intracluster Planetary Nebulae,"I review the progress in research on intracluster planetary nebulae over the
last five years. Hundreds more intracluster planetary nebulae have been
detected in the nearby Virgo and Fornax galaxy clusters, searches of several
galaxy groups have been made, and intracluster planetary candidates have been
detected in the distant Coma cluster. The first theoretical studies of
intracluster planetaries have also been completed, studying their utility as
tracers of the intracluster light as a whole, and also as individual objects.
  From the results to date, it appears that intracluster planetaries are common
in galaxy clusters (10-20% of the total amount of starlight), but thus far,
none have been detected in galaxy groups, a result which currently is not well
understood. Limited spectroscopic follow-up of intracluster planetaries in
Virgo indicate that they have a complex velocity structure, in agreement with
numerical models of intracluster light. Hydrodynamic simulations of individual
intracluster planetaries predict that their morphology is significantly altered
by their intracluster environment, but their emission-line properties appear to
be unaffected.",2006-06-07T20:24:12Z
Heating and cooling of the intergalactic medium by resonance photons,"During the epoch of reionization a large number of photons were produced with
frequencies below the hydrogen Lyman limit. After redshifting into the closest
resonance, these photons underwent multiple scatterings with atoms. We examine
the effect of these scatterings on the temperature of the neutral intergalactic
medium (IGM). Continuum photons, emitted between the Ly_alpha and Ly_gamma
frequencies, heat the gas after being redshifted into the H Ly_alpha or D
Ly_beta resonance. By contrast, photons emitted between the Ly_gamma and
Ly-limit frequencies, produce effective cooling of the gas. Prior to
reionization, the equilibrium temperature of ~100 K for hydrogen and helium
atoms is set by these two competing processes. At the same time, Ly_beta
resonance photons thermally decouple deuterium from other species, raising its
temperature as high as 10^4 K. Our results have important consequences for the
cosmic 21-cm background and the entropy floor of the early IGM which can affect
star formation and reionization.",2006-04-22T18:37:17Z
A Time Variation of Proton-Electron Mass Ratio and Grand Unification,"Astrophysical observations indicate a time variation of the proton-electron
mass ratio and of the fine-structure constant. We discuss this phenomenon in
models of Grand Unification. In these models a time variation of the
fine-structure constant and of the proton mass are expected, if either the
unified coupling constant or the scale of unification changes, or both change.
We discuss in particular the change of the proton mass. Experiments in Quantum
Optics could be done to check these ideas.",2006-05-09T13:09:47Z
"The answer is blowing in the wind: Simulating the interaction of jets
  with dynamic cluster atmospheres","We present numerical simulations investigating the interaction of AGN jets
with galaxy clusters, for the first time taking into account the dynamic nature
of the cluster gas and detailed cluster physics. The simulations successfully
reproduce the observed morphologies of radio sources in clusters. We find that
cluster inhomogeneities and large scale flows have significant impact on the
morphology of the radio source and cannot be ignored a-priori when
investigating radio source dynamics. Morphological comparison suggests that the
gas in the centres of clusters like Virgo and Abell 4059 shows significant
shear and/or rotation. We find that shear and rotation in the intra-cluster
medium move large amounts of cold material back into the path of the jet,
ensuring that subsequent jet outbursts encounter a sufficient column density of
gas to couple with the inner cluster gas, thus alleviating the problem of
evacuated channels discussed in the recent literature. The same effects
redistribute the excess energy Delta_E deposited by the jets, making the
distribution of Delta_E at late times consistent with being isotropic.",2006-06-28T18:06:05Z
Forming a constant density medium close to long gamma-ray bursts,"The progenitor stars of long Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are thought to be
Wolf-Rayet stars, which generate a massive and energetic wind. Nevertheless,
about 25 percent of all GRB afterglows light curves indicate a constant density
medium close to the exploding star. We explore various ways to produce this, by
creating situations where the wind termination shock arrives very close to the
star, as the shocked wind material has a nearly constant density. Typically,
the distance between a Wolf-Rayet star and the wind termination shock is too
large to allow afterglow formation in the shocked wind material. Here, we
investigate possible causes allowing for a smaller distance: A high density or
a high pressure in the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM), a weak Wolf-Rayet
star wind, the presence of a binary companion, and fast motion of the
Wolf-Rayet star relative to the ISM. We find that all four scenarios are
possible in a limited parameter space, but that none of them is by itself
likely to explain the large fraction of constant density afterglows. A low GRB
progenitor metallicity, and a high GRB energy make the occurrence of a GRB
afterglow in a constant density medium more likely. This may be consistent with
constant densities beingpreferentially found for energetic, high redshift GRBs.",2006-05-29T12:56:10Z
"Helium enhancements in globular cluster stars from Asymptotic Giant
  Branch star pollution","Using a chemical evolution model we investigate the intriguing suggestion
that there are populations of stars in some globular clusters (e.g. NGC 2808,
omega Centauri) with enhanced levels of helium (Y from about 0.28 to 0.40)
compared to the majority of the population that presumably have a primordial
helium abundance. We assume that a previous generation of massive
low-metallicity Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars has polluted the cluster
gas via a slow stellar wind. We use two independent sets of AGB yields computed
from detailed models to follow the evolution of helium, carbon, nitrogen and
oxygen in the cluster gas using a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) and a
number of top-heavy IMFs. In no case were we able to fit the observational
constraints, Y > 0.30 and C+N+O approximately constant. Depending on the shape
of the IMF and the yields, we either obtained Y approximately greater than 0.30
and large increases in C+N+O or Y < 0.30 and C+N+O approximately constant.
These results suggest that either AGB stars alone are not responsible for the
large helium enrichment or that any dredge-up from this generation of stars was
less than predicted by standard models.",2006-05-21T21:56:23Z
"New methods for approximating general relativity in numerical
  simulations of stellar core collapse","We review various approaches to approximating general relativistic effects in
hydrodynamic simulations of stellar core collapse and post-bounce evolution.
Different formulations of a modified Newtonian gravitational potential are
presented. Such an effective relativistic potential can be used in an otherwise
standard Newtonian hydrodynamic code. An alternative approximation of general
relativity is the assumption of conformal flatness for the three-metric, and
its extension by adding second post-Newtonian order terms. Using a code which
evolves the coupled system of metric and fluid equations, we apply the various
approximation methods to numerically simulate axisymmetric models for the
collapse of rotating massive stellar cores. We compare the collapse dynamics
and gravitational wave signals (which are extracted using the quadrupole
formula), and thereby assess the quality of the individual approximation
method. It is shown that while the use of an effective relativistic potential
already poses a significant improvement compared to a genuinely Newtonian
approach, the two conformal-flatness-based approximation methods yield even
more accurate results, which are qualitatively and quantitatively very close to
those of a fully general relativistic code even for rotating models which
almost collapse to a black hole.",2006-03-28T11:43:15Z
"Gravity's Relentless Pull: An interactive, multimedia website about
  black holes for Education and Public Outreach","We have created a website, called ""Black Holes: Gravity's Relentless Pull"",
which explains the physics and astronomy of black holes for a general audience.
The site emphasizes user participation and is rich in animations and
astronomical imagery. It won the top prize of the 2005 Pirelli INTERNETional
Awards competition for the best communication of science and technology using
the internet. This article provides a brief overview of the site. The site
starts with an opening animation that introduces the basic concept of a black
hole. The user is then invited to embark on a journey from a backyard view of
the night sky to a personal encounter with a singularity. This journey proceeds
through three modules, which allow the user to: find black holes in the night
sky; travel to a black hole in an animated starship; and explore a black hole
from up close. There are also five ""experiments"" that allow the user to: create
a black hole; orbit around a black hole; weigh a black hole; drop a clock into
a black hole; or fall into a black hole. The modules and experiments offer
goal-based scenarios tailored for novices and children. The site also contains
an encyclopedia of frequently asked questions and a detailed glossary that are
targeted more at experts and adults. The overall result is a website where
scientific knowledge, learning theory, and fun converge. Despite its focus on
black holes, the site also teaches many other concepts of physics, astronomy
and scientific thought. The site aims to instill an appreciation for learning
and an interest in science, especially in the younger users. It can be used as
an aid in teaching introductory astronomy at the undergraduate level.",2006-06-23T20:44:27Z
Discovery of a Binary Centaur,"We have identified a binary companion to (42355) 2002 CR46 in our ongoing
deep survey using the Hubble Space Telescope's High Resolution Camera. It is
the first companion to be found around an object in a non-resonant orbit that
crosses the orbits of giant planets. Objects in orbits of this kind, the
Centaurs, have experienced repeated strong scattering with one or more giant
planets and therefore the survival of binaries in this transient population has
been in question. Monte Carlo simulations suggest, however, that binaries in
(42355) 2002 CR46 -like heliocentric orbits have a high probability of survival
for reasonable estimates of the binary's still-unknown system mass and
separation. Because Centaurs are thought to be precursors to short period
comets, the question of the existence of binary comets naturally arises; none
has yet been definitively identified. The discovery of one binary in a sample
of eight observed by HST suggests that binaries in this population may not be
uncommon.",2006-05-23T22:07:40Z
"Using Galaxy Two-point Correlation Functions to Determine the Redshift
  Distributions of Galaxies Binned by Photometric Redshift","We investigate how well the redshift distributions of galaxies sorted into
photometric redshift bins can be determined from the galaxy angular two-point
correlation functions. We find that the uncertainty in the reconstructed
redshift distributions depends critically on the number of parameters used in
each redshift bin and the range of angular scales used, but not on the number
of photometric redshift bins. Using six parameters for each photometric
redshift bin, and restricting ourselves to angular scales over which the galaxy
number counts are normally distributed, we find that errors in the
reconstructed redshift distributions are large; i.e., they would be the
dominant source of uncertainty in cosmological parameters estimated from
otherwise ideal weak lensing or baryon acoustic oscillation data. However,
either by reducing the number of free parameters in each redshift bin, or by
(unjustifiably) applying our Gaussian analysis into the non-Gaussian regime, we
find that the correlation functions can be used to reconstruct the redshift
distributions with moderate precision; e.g., with mean redshifts determined to
around 0.01. We also find that dividing the galaxies into two spectral types,
and thereby doubling the number of redshift distribution parameters, can result
in a reduction in the errors in the combined redshift distributions.",2006-06-05T21:03:26Z
The infrared counterpart to the magnetar 1RXS J170849.0-400910,"We have analyzed both archival and new infrared imaging observations of the
field of the Anomalous X-ray Pulsar 1RXS J170849.0-400910, in search of the
infrared counterpart. This field has been previously investigated, and one of
the sources consistent with the position of the AXP suggested as the
counterpart. We, however, find that this object is more likely a background
star, while another object within the positional error circle has non-stellar
colors and shows evidence for variability. These two pieces of evidence, along
with a consistency argument for the X-ray-to-infrared flux ratio, point to the
second source being the more likely infrared counterpart to the AXP.",2006-05-12T20:12:18Z
Algorithmic regularization with velocity-dependent forces,"Algorithmic regularization uses a transformation of the equations of motion
such that the leapfrog algorithm produces exact trajectories for two-body
motion as well as regular results in numerical integration of the motion of
strongly interacting few-body systems. That algorithm alone is not sufficiently
accurate and one must use the extrapolation method for improved precision. This
requires that the basic leapfrog algorithm be time-symmetric, which is not
directly possible in the case of velocity-dependent forces, but is usually
obtained with the help of the implicit midpoint method. Here we suggest an
alternative explicit algorithmic regularization algorithm which can handle
velocity-dependent forces. This is done with the help of a generalized midpoint
method to obtain the required time symmetry, thus eliminating the need for the
implicit midpoint method and allowing the use of extrapolation.",2006-05-02T12:03:36Z
X-ray Selected Intermediate-Redshift Groups of Galaxies,"We present spectroscopic confirmation of nine moderate redshift galaxy groups
and poor clusters selected from the ROSAT Deep Cluster Survey. The groups span
the redshift range z=0.23-0.59 and have between 4 and 20 confirmed members. The
velocity dispersions of these groups range from 125 to 650 km/s. Similar to
X-ray groups at low redshift, these systems contain a significant number of
early-type galaxies. Therefore, the trend for X-ray luminous groups to have
high early-type fractions is already in place by at least z=0.5. In 4 of the 9
groups, the X-ray emission is clearly peaked on the most luminous early-type
galaxy in the group. However, in several cases the central galaxy is composed
of multiple luminous nuclei, suggesting that the brightest group galaxy may
still be undergoing major mergers. In at least 3 of the groups in our sample, a
dominant early-type galaxy is not found at the center of the group potential.
This suggests that many of our groups are not dynamically evolved despite their
high X-ray luminosities. While similar systems have been identified at low
redshift, the X-ray luminosities of the intermediate redshift examples are one
to three orders of magnitude higher than those of their low redshift
counterparts. We suggest that this may be evidence for group downsizing: while
massive groups are still in the process of collapsing and virializing at
intermediate redshifts, only low-mass groups are in the process of forming at
the present day.",2006-06-02T20:47:15Z
"Simulations and Analytic Calculations of Bubble Growth During Hydrogen
  Reionization","We present results from a large volume simulation of Hydrogen reionization.
We combine 3d radiative transfer calculations and an N-body simulation,
describing structure formation in the intergalactic medium, to detail the
growth of HII regions around high redshift galaxies. Our simulation tracks
1024^3 dark matter particles, in a box of co-moving side length 65.6 Mpc/h.
This large volume allows us to accurately characterize the size distribution of
HII regions throughout most of the reionization process. At the same time, our
simulation resolves many of the small galaxies likely responsible for
reionization. It confirms a picture anticipated by analytic models: HII regions
grow collectively around highly-clustered sources, and have a well-defined
characteristic size, which evolves from a sub-Mpc scale at the beginning of
reionization to R > 10 Mpc towards the end. We present a detailed statistical
description of our results, and compare them with a numerical scheme based on
the analytic model by Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga, and Hernquist. We find that the
analytic calculation reproduces the size distribution of HII regions and the 21
cm power spectrum of the radiative transfer simulation remarkably well. The
ionization field from the simulation, however, has more small scale structure
than the analytic calculation, owing to Poisson scatter in the simulated
abundance of galaxies on small scales. We propose and validate a simple scheme
to incorporate this scatter into our calculations. Our results suggest that
analytic calculations are sufficiently accurate to aid in predicting and
interpreting the results of future 21 cm surveys. In particular, our fast
numerical scheme is useful for forecasting constraints from future 21 cm
surveys, and in constructing mock surveys to test data analysis procedures.",2006-04-11T20:00:26Z
The radio structure of radio-quiet quasars,"We investigate the radio emitting structures of radio-quiet active galactic
nuclei with an emphasis on radio-quiet quasars to study their connection to
Seyfert galaxies. We present and analyse high-sensitivity VLA radio continuum
images of 14 radio-quiet quasars and six Seyfert galaxies. Many of the low
redshift radio-quiet quasars show radio structures that can be interpreted as
jet-like outflows. However, the detection rate of extended radio structures on
arcsecond scales among our sample decreases with increasing redshift and
luminosity, most likely due to a lack of resolution. The morphologies of the
detected radio emission indicate strong interactions of the jets with the
surrounding medium. We also compare the radio data of seven quasars with
corresponding HST images of the [OIII] emitting narrow-line region (NLR). We
find that the scenario of interaction between the radio jet and the NLR gas is
confirmed in two sources by structures in the NLR gas distribution as
previously known for Seyfert galaxies. The extended radio structures of
radio-quiet quasars at sub-arcsecond resolution are by no means different from
that of Seyferts. Among the luminosities studied here, the morphological
features found are similar in both types of objects while the overall size of
the radio structures increases with luminosity. This supports the picture where
radio-quiet quasars are the scaled-up versions of Seyfert galaxies. In addition
to known luminosity relations we find a correlation of the NLR size and the
radio size shared by quasars and Seyferts.",2006-06-21T21:37:32Z
"Using the Active Collimator and Shield Assembly of an EXIST-Type Mission
  as a Gamma-Ray Burst Spectrometer","The Energetic X-ray Imaging Survey Telescope (EXIST) is a mission design
concept that uses coded masks seen by Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) detectors to
register hard X-rays in the energy region from 10 keV to 600 keV. A partially
active or fully active anti-coincidence shield/collimator with a total area of
between 15 and 35 square meters will be used to define the field of view of the
CZT detectors and to suppress the background of cosmic-ray-induced events. In
this paper, we describe the use of a sodium activated cesium iodide
shield/collimator to detect gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and to measure their energy
spectra in the energy range from 100 keV up to 10 MeV. We use the code GEANT4
to simulate the interactions of photons and cosmic rays with the spacecraft and
instrument and the code DETECT2000 to simulate the optical properties of the
scintillation detectors. The shield collimator achieves a nu-F-nu sensitivity
of 3 x 10^(-9) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1) and 2 x 10^(-8) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1) at 100 keV
and 600 keV, respectively. The sensitivity is well matched to that of the coded
mask telescope. The broad energy coverage of an EXIST-type mission with active
shields will constrain the peak of the spectral energy distribution (SED) for a
large number of GRBs. The measurement of the SED peak may be key for
determining photometric GRB redshifts and for using GRBs as cosmological
probes.",2006-06-05T17:05:38Z
The Hubble Sphere Hydrogen Survey,"An all sky redshift survey, using hydrogen 21 cm emission to locate galaxies,
can be used to track the wavelength of baryon acoustic oscillations imprints
from z ~ 1.5 to z = 0. This will allow precise determination of the evolution
of dark energy. A telescope made of fixed parabolic cylindrical reflectors
offers substantial benefit for such a redshift survey. Fixed cylinders can be
built for low cost, and long cylinders also allow low cost fast fourier
transform techniques to be used to define thousands of simultaneous beams. A
survey made with fixed reflectors naturally covers all of the sky available
from it's site with good uniformity, minimizing sample variance in the
measurement of the acoustic peak wavelength. Such a survey will produce about a
billion redshifts, nearly a thousand times the number available today. The
survey will provide a three dimensional mapping of a substantial fraction of
the Hubble Sphere.",2006-06-06T02:48:39Z
"Impact of Stellar Dynamics on the Frequency of Giant Planets in Close
  Binaries","Hostile tidal forces may inhibit the formation of Jovian planets in binaries
with semimajor axes of $\la$$50\au$, binaries that might be called ``close'' in
this context. As an alternative to in situ planet formation, a binary can
acquire a giant planet when one of its original members is replaced in a
dynamical interaction with another star that hosts a planet. Simple scaling
relations for the structure and evolution of star clusters, coupled with
analytic arguments regarding binary-single and binary-binary scattering,
indicate that dynamical processes can deposit Jovian planets in $<$1% of close
binaries. If ongoing and future exoplanet surveys measure a much larger
fraction, it may be that giant planets do somehow form frequently in such
systems.",2006-06-27T04:59:42Z
Cosmography with cluster strong lensing,"By stacking an ensemble of strong lensing clusters, we demonstrate the
feasibility of placing constraints on the dark energy equation of state. This
is achieved by using multiple images of sources at two or more distinct
redshift planes. The sample of smooth clusters in our simulations is based on
observations of massive clusters and the distribution of background galaxies is
constructed using the Hubble Deep Field. Our source distribution reproduces the
observed redshift distribution of multiply imaged sources in Abell 1689. The
cosmology recovery depends on the number of image families with known
spectroscopic redshifts and the number of stacked clusters. Our simulations
suggest that constraints comparable to those derived from other competing
established techniques on a constant dark energy equation of state can be
obtained using 10 to 40 clusters with 5 or more families of multiple images. We
have also studied the observational errors in the image redshifts and
positions. We find that spectroscopic redshifts and high resolution {\it Hubble
Space Telescope} images are required to eliminate confidence contour relaxation
relative to the ideal case in our simulations. This suggests that the dark
energy equation of state, and other cosmological parameters, can be constrained
with existing {\it Hubble Space Telescope} images of lensing clusters coupled
with dedicated ground-based arc spectroscopy.",2006-05-10T15:24:52Z
"New evidence for a linear colour-magnitude relation and a single
  Schechter function for red galaxies in a nearby cluster of galaxies down to
  M*+8","The colour and luminosity distributions of red galaxies in the cluster Abell
1185 (z=0.0325) were studied down to M*+8 in the B, V and R bands. The
colour-magnitude (hereafter CM) relation is linear without evidence for a
significant bending down to absolute magnitudes which are seldom probed in
literature (M_R=-12.5 mag). The CM relation is thin (+/-0.04 mag) and its
thickness is quite independent from the magnitude. The luminosity function of
red galaxies in Abell 1185 is adequately described by a Schechter function,
with a characteristic magnitude and a faint end slope that also well describe
the LF of red galaxies in other clusters. There is no passband dependency of
the LF shape other than an obvious M* shift due to the colour of the considered
population. Finally, we conclude that, based on colours and luminosity, red
galaxies form an homogeneous population over four decades in stellar mass,
providing a second evidence against faint red galaxies being a recent cluster
population.",2006-06-29T08:18:41Z
[TiII] and [NiII] emission from the strontium filament of eta Carinae,"We study the nature of the [TiII] and [NiII] emission from the so-called
strontium filament found in the ejecta of eta Carinae. To this purpose we
employ multilevel models of the TiII and NiII systems which are used to
investigate the physical condition of the filament and the excitation
mechanisms of the observed lines. For the TiII ion, for which no atomic data
was previously available, we carry out ab initio calculations of radiative
transition rates and electron impact excitation rate coefficients. It is found
that the observed spectrum is consistent with the lines being excited in a
mostly neutral region with an electron density of the order of $10^7$ cm$^{-3}$
and a temperature around 6000 K. In analyzing three observations with different
slit orientations recorded between March~2000 and November~2001 we find line
ratios that change among various observations, in a way consistent with changes
of up to an order of magnitude in the strength of the continuum radiation
field. These changes result from different samplings of the extended filament,
due to the different slit orientations used for each observation, and yield
clues on the spatial extent and optical depth of the filament. The observed
emission indicates a large Ti/Ni abundance ratio relative to solar abundances.
It is suggested that the observed high Ti/Ni ratio in gas is caused by dust-gas
fractionation processes and does not reflect the absolute Ti/Ni ratio in the
ejecta of \etacar. We study the condensation chemistry of Ti, Ni and Fe within
the filament and suggest that the observed gas phase overabundance of Ti",2006-06-12T19:27:33Z
"From Supermassive Black Holes to Dwarf Elliptical Nuclei: a Mass
  Continuum","Considerable evidence suggests that supermassive black holes reside at the
centers of massive galactic bulges. At a lower galactic mass range, many dwarf
galaxies contain extremely compact nuclei that structurally resemble massive
globular clusters. We show that both these types of central massive objects
(CMO's) define a single unbroken relation between CMO mass and the luminosity
of their host galaxy spheroid. Equivalently, M_CMO is directly proportional to
the host spheroid mass over 4 orders of magnitude. We note that this result has
been simultaneously and independently identified by Cote et al. (2006), see
also Ferrarese et al. (2006). We therefore suggest that the dE,N nuclei may be
the low-mass analogs of supermassive black holes, and that these two types of
CMO's may have both developed starting from similar initial formation
processes. The overlap mass interval between the two types of CMO's is small,
and suggests that for M_CMO > 10^7 M_sun, the formation of a black hole was
strongly favored, perhaps because the initial gas infall to the center was too
rapid and violent for star formation to occur efficiently.",2006-03-29T21:00:03Z
Rotational and Cyclical Variability in gamma Cassiopeia,"We report results of a nine-year monitoring effort on the unusual classical
Be with a robotic ground-based (APT) B,V-filtered telescope as well as
simultaneous observations in 2004 November with this instrument and the RXTE
(X-ray) telescope. Our observations disclosed no correlated optical response to
the rapid X-ray flares in this star, nor did the star show any sustained flux
changes during the course of either of the two monitored nights in either
wavelength regime. Our optical light curves reveal that gamma Cas undergoes
\~3%-amplitude cycles with lengths of 60--90 days. Over the nine days we
monitored the star with the RXTE, the X-ray flux varied in phase with its
optical cycle and with an amplitude predicted from correlated optical/X-ray
data from an earlier paper. The amplitudes of the V magnitude cycles are
30--40% larger than the B amplitudes, suggesting the seat of the cycles is
circumstellar. The cycle lengths constantly change and can damp or grow on
timescales as short as 13 days. We have also discovered a coherent period of
1.21581 +/-0.00002 days in all our data, which is consistent only with
rotation. The full amplitude of this variation is 0.0060 in both filters. The
derived waveform, somewhat surprisingly, is almost sawtooth in shape. This
variation probably originates on the star's surface. This circumstance hints at
the existence of a strong magnetic field with a complex topology and an
associated heterogeneous surface composition.",2006-03-13T01:22:14Z
Heating and cooling of the intergalactic medium by resonance photons,"During the epoch of reionization a large number of photons were produced with
frequencies below the hydrogen Lyman limit. After redshifting into the closest
resonance, these photons underwent multiple scatterings with atoms. We examine
the effect of these scatterings on the temperature of the neutral intergalactic
medium (IGM). Continuum photons, emitted between the Ly_alpha and Ly_gamma
frequencies, heat the gas after being redshifted into the H Ly_alpha or D
Ly_beta resonance. By contrast, photons emitted between the Ly_gamma and
Ly-limit frequencies, produce effective cooling of the gas. Prior to
reionization, the equilibrium temperature of ~100 K for hydrogen and helium
atoms is set by these two competing processes. At the same time, Ly_beta
resonance photons thermally decouple deuterium from other species, raising its
temperature as high as 10^4 K. Our results have important consequences for the
cosmic 21-cm background and the entropy floor of the early IGM which can affect
star formation and reionization.",2006-04-22T18:37:17Z
Diagnostics of SS433 with the RXTE,"We present analysis of extensive monitoring of SS433 by the RXTE observatory
collected over the period 1996-2005. The difference between energy spectra
taken at different precessional and orbital phases shows the presence of a
strong photoabsorption near the optical star, probably due to its powerful
dense wind. Assuming that a precessing accretion disk is thick, we recover the
temperature profile in the X-ray emitting jet that best fits the observed
precessional variations of the X-ray emission temperature. The hottest visible
part of the X-ray jet is located at a distance of $l_0/a\sim0.06-0.09$, or
$\sim2-3\times10^{11}$cm from the central compact object and has a temperature
of about $T_{\rm max}\sim30$ keV. We discovered appreciable orbital X-ray
eclipses at the ``crossover'' precessional phases (jets are in the plane of the
sky, disk is edge-on) which put a lower limit on the size of the optical
component $R/a\ga0.5$ and an upper limit on a mass ratio of binary companions
$q=M_{\rm x}/M_{\rm opt}\la0.3-0.35$. The size of the eclipsing region can be
larger than secondary's Roche lobe because of substantial photoabsorption by
dense stellar wind. This must be taken into account when evaluating the mass
ratio from analysis of X-ray eclipses.",2006-07-10T14:32:14Z
"Improving the Lagrangian perturbative solution for cosmic fluid:
  Applying Shanks transformation","We study the behavior of Lagrangian perturbative solutions. For a spherical
void model, the higher order the Lagrangian perturbation we consider, the worse
the approximation becomes in late-time evolution. In particular, if we stop to
improve until an even order is reached, the perturbative solution describes the
contraction of the void. To solve this problem, we consider improving the
perturbative solution using Shanks transformation, which accelerates the
convergence of the sequence. After the transformation, we find that the
accuracy of higher-order perturbation is recovered and the perturbative
solution is refined well. Then we show that this improvement method can apply
for a $\Lambda$CDM model and improved the power spectrum of the density field.",2006-05-10T06:38:20Z
Self-Gravity Driven Instabilities in the ISM,"In order to understand star formation it is important to understand the
dynamics of atomic and molecular clouds in the interstellar medium (ISM).
Nonlinear hydrodynamic flows are a key component to the ISM. One route by which
nonlinear flows arise is the onset and evolution of interfacial instabilities.
Interfacial instabilities act to modify the interface between gas components at
different densities and temperatures. Such an interface may be subject to a
host of instabilities, including the Rayleigh-Taylor, Kelvin-Helmholtz, and
Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities. Recently, a new density interface instability
was identified. This self-gravity interfacial instability (SGI) causes any
displacement of the interface to gr ow on roughly a free-fall time scale, even
when the perturbation wavelength is much less than the Jeans length. In
previous work, we used numerical simulations to confirm the expectations of
linear theory and examine the nonlinear evolution of the SGI. We now continue
our study by generalizing our initial conditions to allow the acceleration due
to self-gravity to be non-zero across the interface. We also consider the
behaviour of the SGI for perturbation wavelengths near the Jeans wavelength. We
conclude that the action of self-gravity across a density interface may play a
significant role in the ISM either by fueling the growth of new instabilities
or modifying the evolution of existing instabilities.",2006-03-29T23:26:22Z
E- and B-mode mixing from incomplete knowledge of the shear correlation,"Aims. We quantify the mixing of the measured cosmic-shear E- and B-modes
caused by the lack of shear-correlation measurements on small and large scales,
arising from a lack of close projected galaxy pairs and the finite field size,
respectively.
  Methods. We calculate the aperture-mass statistics <M_{ap, perp}^2> and the
E-/B-mode shear-correlation functions xi_{E, B +/-} where small- and
large-scale cutoffs are taken into account. We assess the deviation of the
obtained E-mode to the true E-mode and the introduction of a spurious B-mode.
  Results. The measured aperture-mass dispersion is underestimated by more than
10% on scales smaller than 12 times the lower cutoff. For a precise measurement
of the E- and B-modes at the percent level using a combination of xi_{E, B +}
and xi_{E, B -}, a field as large as 7 (2.4) degrees is necessary for
ground-based (space-based) observations.",2006-04-25T14:38:32Z
Fe/Ni ratio in the Ant Nebula Mz 3,"We have analyzed the [Fe II] and [Ni II] emission lines in the bipolar
planetary nebula Mz~3. We find that the [Fe II] and [Ni II] lines arise
exclusively from the central regions. Fluorescence excitation in the formation
process of these lines is negligible for this low-excitation nebula. From the
[Fe II]/[Ni II] ratio, we obtain a higher Fe/Ni abundance ratio with respect to
the solar value. The current result provides further supporting evidence for Mz
3 as a symbiotic Mira.",2006-05-06T06:22:08Z
"Accelerating universe in scalar tensor models - confrontation of
  theoretical predictions with observations","We consider scalar tensor theories of gravity assuming that the scalar field
is non minimally coupled with gravity. We use this theory to study evolution of
a flat homogeneous and isotropic universe. In this case the dynamical equations
can be derived form a point like Lagrangian. We study the general properties of
dynamics of this system and show that for a wide range of initial conditions
such models lead in a natural way to an accelerated phase of expansion of the
universe. Assuming that the point like Lagrangian admits a Noether symmetry we
are able to explicitly solve the dynamical equations. We study one particular
model and show that its predictions are compatible with observational data,
namely the publicly available data on type Ia supernovae, the parameters of
large scale structure determined by the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey
(2dFGRS), the measurements of cosmological distances with the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and the rate of growth of density perturbations}{It
turns out that this model have a very interesting feature of producing in a
natural way an epoch of accelerated expansion. With an appropriate choice of
parameters our model is fully compatible with several observed characteristics
of the universe",2006-04-03T13:17:48Z
"The Role of Evolutionary Age and Metallicity in the Formation of
  Classical Be Circumstellar Disks I. New Candidate Be Stars in the LMC, SMC,
  and Milky Way","We present B, V, R, and H alpha photometry of 8 clusters in the Small
Magellanic Cloud, 5 in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and 3 Galactic clusters, and
use 2 color diagrams (2-CDs) to identify candidate Be star populations in these
clusters. We find evidence that the Be phenomenon is enhanced in low
metallicity environments, based on the observed fractional early-type candidate
Be star content of clusters of age 10-25 Myr. Numerous candidate Be stars of
spectral types B0 to B5 were identified in clusters of age 5-8 Myr, challenging
the suggestion of Fabregat & Torrejon (2000) that classical Be stars should
only be found in clusters at least 10 Myr old. These results suggest that a
significant number of B-type stars must emerge onto the zero-age-main-sequence
as rapid rotators. We also detect an enhancement in the fractional content of
early-type candidate Be stars in clusters of age 10-25 Myr, suggesting that the
Be phenomenon does become more prevalent with evolutionary age. We briefly
discuss the mechanisms which might contribute to such an evolutionary effect. A
discussion of the limitations of utilizing the 2-CD technique to investigate
the role evolutionary age and/or metallicity play in the development of the Be
phenomenon is offered, and we provide evidence that other B-type objects of
very different nature, such as candidate Herbig Ae/Be stars may contaminate the
claimed detections of ``Be stars'' via 2-CDs.",2006-06-21T14:50:00Z
A note on cosmological parameters and the topology of the universe,"Given the wealth of increasingly accurate cosmological observations,
especially the recent results from the WMAP, and the development of methods and
strategies in the search for cosmic topology, it is reasonable to expect that
we should be able to detect the spatial topology of the Universe in the near
future. Motivated by this, we examine to what extent a possible detection of a
nontrivial topology of positively curved universe may be used to place
constraints on the matter content of the Universe. We show through concrete
examples that the knowledge of the spatial topology allows to place constraints
on the density parameters associated to dark matter ($\Omega_m$) and dark
energy ($\Omega_{\Lambda}$)",2006-04-05T00:54:14Z
"A ""Missing"" Supernova Remnant revealed by the 21-cm Line of Atomic
  Hydrogen","Although some 20--30,000 supernova remnants (SNRs) are expected to exist in
the Milky Way, only about 230 are presently known. This implies that most SNRs
are ``missing''. Recently, we proposed that small ($\simlt 1^\circ$), faint,
high-velocity features seen in large-scale 21-cm line surveys of atomic
hydrogen ({\sc Hi}) in the Galactic plane could be examples of such {\it
missing} old SNRs. Here we report on high-resolution \schi observations of one
such candidate, FVW 190.2+1.1, which is revealed to be a rapidly expanding
($\sim 80$ \kms) shell. The parameters of this shell seem only consistent with
FVW 190.2+1.1 being the remnant of a SN explosion that occurred in the
outermost fringes of the Galaxy some $\sim 3\times 10^5$ yr ago. This shell is
not seen in any other wave band suggesting that it represents the oldest type
of SNR, that which is essentially invisible except via its \schi line emission.
FVW 190.2+1.1 is one of a hundred ""forbidden-velocity wings"" (FVWs) recently
identified in the Galactic plane, and our discovery suggests that many of these
are likely to be among the oldest SNRs. We discuss the possible link between
FVWs and fast-moving atomic clouds in the Galaxy.",2006-04-09T14:29:11Z
Spitzer Observations of High Redshift Radio Galaxies,"We present the results of a comprehensive Spitzer survey of 70 radio galaxies
across 1<z<5.2. Using IRAC, IRS and MIPS imaging we determine the rest-frame
AGN contribution to the stellar emission peak at 1.6um. The stellar
luminosities are found to be consistent with that of a giant elliptical with a
stellar mass of 10^11-12Msun. The mean stellar mass remains constant at
\~10^11.5Msun up to z=3 indicating that the upper end of the mass function is
already in place by this redshift. The mid-IR luminosities imply bolometric IR
luminosities that would classify all sources as ULIRGs. The mid-IR to radio
luminosity generally correlate implying a common origin for these emissions.
The ratio is higher than that found for lower redshift, ie z<1, radio galaxies.",2006-04-11T02:37:34Z
"Chemical abundances in LMC stellar populations I. The Inner disk sample
  Based on observations collected at the VLT UT2 telescope","The advent of the new class 8 meters telescopes allows for the first time the
detailed study of numerous stars of galaxies other than our own. The Large
Magellanic Cloud is one of the most interesting targets due to its proximity
and its relatively face-on disk, permitting to separate populations pertaining
to the different structures of the galaxy. We have used FLAMES (the Fibre Large
Array Multi Element Spectrograph) at the VLT-UT2 telescope to obtain spectra of
a large sample of stars from the Inner Disk of the LMC, $\sim$2 kpc from the
center of the galaxy. We investigate the chemical abundances of iron-peak
elements, heavy and light $s$-process elements, Cu, Na, Sc and
$\alpha$-elements for a sample of red giant stars. Metallicities for the sample
stars range from [Fe/H] = $-$1.76 to $-$0.02. LMC inner disk stars show a
definitely different chemical pattern when compared to galactic stars of the
same metallicity.",2006-04-01T20:25:10Z
Cosmic Supernova Rates and the Hubble Sequence,"We compute the type Ia, Ib/c and II supernova (SN) rates as functions of the
cosmic time for galaxies of different morphological types. We use four
different chemical evolution models, each one reproducing the features of a
particular morphological type: E/S0, S0a/b, Sbc/d and Irr galaxies. We
essentially describe the Hubble sequence by means of decreasing efficiency of
star formation and increasing infall timescale. These models are used to study
the evolution of the SN rates per unit luminosity and per unit mass as
functions of cosmic time and as functions of the Hubble type. Our results
indicate that: (i) the observed increase of the SN rate per unit luminosity and
unit mass from early to late galaxy types is accounted for by our models. Our
explanation of this effect is related to the fact that the latest Hubble types
have the highest star formation rate per unit mass; (ii) By adopting a Scalo
(1986) initial mass function in spiral disks, we find that massive single stars
ending their lives as Wolf-Rayet objects are not sufficient to account for the
observed type Ib/c SN rate per unit mass. Less massive stars in close binary
systems can give instead a significant contribution to the local Ib/c SN rates.
On the other hand, with the assumption of a Salpeter (1955) IMF for all galaxy
types, single massive WR stars are sufficient to account for the observed type
Ib/c SN rate. (iii) Our models allow us to reproduce the observed type Ia SN
rate density up to redshift z~1. We predict an increasing type Ia SN rate
density with redshift, reaching a peak at redshift z >= 3, because of the
contribution of massive spheroids.",2006-07-31T16:31:06Z
Luminous superclusters: remnants from inflation,"We derive the luminosity and multiplicity functions of superclusters compiled
for the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Data Release
4), and for three samples of simulated superclusters. We find for all
supercluster samples Density Field (DF) clusters, which represent high-density
peaks of the class of Abell clusters, and use median luminosities/masses of
richness class 1 DF-clusters to calculate relative luminosity/mass functions.
We show that the fraction of very luminous (massive) superclusters in real
samples is more than tenfolds greater than in simulated samples. Superclusters
are generated by large-scale density perturbations which evolve very slowly.
The absence of very luminous superclusters in simulations can be explained
either by non-proper treatment of large-scale perturbations, or by some yet
unknown processes in the very early Universe.",2006-05-16T17:03:56Z
"Stellar halos and elliptical galaxy formation: Origin of dynamical
  properties of the planetary nebular systems","Recent spectroscopic observations of planetary nebulae (PNe) in several
elliptical galaxies have revealed structural and kinematical properties of the
outer stellar halo regions. In order to elucidate the origin of the properties
of these planetary nebula systems (PNSs), we consider the merger scenario in
which an elliptical galaxy is formed by merging of spiral galaxies. Using
numerical simulations, we particularly investigate radial profiles of projected
PNe number densities, rotational velocities, and velocity dispersions of PNSs
extending to the outer halo regions of elliptical galaxies formed from major
and unequal-mass merging. We find that the radial profiles of the project
number densities can be fitted to the power-law and the mean number density in
the outer halos of the ellipticals can be more than an order of magnitude
higher than that of the original spiral's halo. The PNSs are found to show a
significant amount of rotation (V/sigma >0.5) in the outer halo regions ($R$
$>$ $5R_{\rm e}$) of the ellipticals. Two-dimensional velocity fields of PNSs
are derived from the simulations and their dependences on model parameters of
galaxy merging are discussed in detail. We compare the simulated kinematics of
PNSs with that of the PNS observed in NGC 5128 and thereby discuss advantages
and disadvantages of the merger model in explaining the observed kinematics of
the PNS. We also find that the kinematics of PNSs in elliptical galaxies are
quite diverse depending on the orbital configurations of galaxy merging, the
mass ratio of merger progenitor spirals, and the viewing angle of the galaxies.
This variation translates directly into possible biases by a factor of more
than two in observational mass estimation (abridged). ~ ~",2006-06-22T04:21:27Z
RHESSI Results -- Time For a Rethink?,"Hard X-rays and gamma-rays are the most direct signatures of energetic
electrons and ions in the sun's atmosphere which is optically thin at these
energies and their radiation involves no coherent processes. Being collisional
they are complementary to gyro-radiation in probing atmospheric density as
opposed to magnetic field and the electrons are primarily 10--100 keV in
energy, complementing the (>100 keV) electrons likely responsible for microwave
bursts.
  The pioneering results of the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager
(RHESSI) are raising the first new major questions concerning solar energetic
particles in many years. Some highlights of these results are discussed --
primarily around RHESSI topics on which the authors have had direct research
involvement -- particularly when they are raising the need for re-thinking of
entrenched ideas. Results and issues are broadly divided into discoveries in
the spatial, temporal and spectral domains, with the main emphasis on flare
hard X-rays/fast electrons but touching also on gamma-rays/ions, non-flare
emissions, and the relationship to radio bursts.",2006-07-19T10:59:21Z
"The X-ray Properties of Active Galactic Nuclei with Double-Peaked Balmer
  Lines","Double-peaked Balmer-line profiles originate in the accretion disks of a few
percent of optically selected AGN. The reasons behind the strong low-ionization
line emission from the accretion disks of these objects is still uncertain. In
this paper, we characterize the X-ray properties of 39 double-peaked Balmer
line AGN, 29 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 10 low optical-luminosity
double-peaked emitters from earlier radio-selected samples. We find that the
UV-to-X-ray slope of radio-quiet (RQ) double-peaked emitters as a class does
not differ substantially from that of normal RQ AGN with similar UV
monochromatic luminosity. The radio-loud (RL) double-peaked emitters, with the
exception of LINER galaxies, are more luminous in the X-rays than RQ AGN, as
has been observed for other RL AGN with single-peaked profiles. The X-ray
spectral shapes of double-peaked emitters, measured by their hardness ratios or
power-law photon indices, are also largely consistent with those of normal AGN
of similar radio-loudness. In practically all cases studied here, external
illumination of the accretion disk is necessary to produce the Balmer-line
emission, as the gravitational energy released locally in the disk by viscous
stresses is insufficient to produce lines of the observed strength. In the
Appendix we study the variability of Mrk 926, a double-peaked emitter with
several observations in the optical and X-ray bands.",2006-07-11T12:54:44Z
A Panoramic Mid-infrared Survey of Two Distant Clusters,"(abridged) We present panoramic Spitzer MIPS 24um observations covering
9x9Mpc (25'x25') fields around two massive clusters, Cl0024+16 and MS0451-03,
at z=0.39 and z=0.55. Our observations cover a very wide range of environments
within these clusters, from high-density regions around the cores out to the
turn-around radius. Cross-correlating the mid-infrared catalogs with deep
optical and near-infrared imaging of these fields, we investigate the
optical/near-infrared colors of the mid-infrared sources. We find excesses of
mid-infrared sources with optical/near-infrared colors expected of cluster
members in the two clusters and test this selection using spectroscopically
confirmed 24um members. The much more significant excess is associated with
Cl0024+16, whereas MS0451-03 has comparatively few mid-infrared sources. The
mid-infrared galaxy population in Cl0024+16 appears to be associated with dusty
star-forming galaxies (typically redder than the general cluster population by
up to A_V~1-2 mags) rather than emission from dusty tori around active galactic
nuclei (AGN) in early-type hosts. The inferred total-infrared star-formation
rates in Cl0024+16 are typically >5x greater than those found from a similar
Halpha survey, indicating significant obscured activity in the cluster
population. We find evidence for strong evolution of the level of dust-obscured
star-formation in dense environments out to z=0.5, analogous to the rise in
fraction of optically-selected star-forming galaxies seen in clusters and the
field out to similar redshifts. However, there are clearly significant
cluster-to-cluster variations in the populations of mid-infrared sources,
probably reflecting differences in the intracluster media and recent dynamical
evolution of these systems.",2006-06-06T11:06:54Z
Black-Hole Accretion Disc as an Analogue Gravity Model,"We formulate and solve the equations governing the transonic behaviour of a
general relativistic black-hole accretion disc with non-zero advection
velocity. We demonstrate that a relativistic Rankine-Hugoniot shock may form
leading to the formation of accretion powered outflow. We show that the
critical points of transonic discs generally do not coincide with the
corresponding sonic points. The collection of such sonic points forms an
axisymmetric hypersurface, generators of which are the acoustic null geodesics,
i.e. the phonon trajectories. Such a surface is shown to be identical with an
acoustic event horizon. The acoustic surface gravity and the corresponding
analogue horizon temperature $T_{AH}$ at the acoustic horizon are then computed
in terms of fundamental accretion parameters. Physically, the analogue
temperature is associated with the thermal phonon radiation analogous to the
Hawking radiation of the black-hole horizon.Thus, an axisymmetric black-hole
accretion disc is established as a natural example of the classical analogue
gravity model, for which two kinds of horizon exist simultaneously. We have
shown that for some values of astrophysically relevant accretion parameters,
the analogue temperature exceeds the corresponding Hawking temperature. We
point out that acoustic {\it white holes} can also be generated for a
multi-transonic black-hole accretion with a shock. Such a white hole, produced
at the shock, is always flanked by two acoustic black holes generated at the
inner and the outer sonic points. Finally, we discuss possible applications of
our work to other astrophysical events which may exhibit analogue effects.",2006-04-21T20:12:21Z
"Deep spectroscopy of 9C J1503+4528: a very young CSS radio source at
  z=0.521","9C J1503+4528 is a very young CSS radio galaxy, with an age of order 10^4
years. This source is therefore an ideal laboratory for the study ofthe
intrinsic host galaxy/IGM properties, interactions between the radio source and
surrounding ISM, links between star formation and AGN activity and the radio
source triggering mechanism. Here we present the results of a spectroscopic
analysis of this source, considering each of these aspects of radio source
physics.
  We find that shock ionization by the young radio source is important in the
central regions of the galaxy on scales similar to that of the radio source
itself, whilst evidence for an AGN ionization cone is observed at greater
distances. Line and continuum features require the presence of a young stellar
population, the best-fit model for which implies an age of 5x10^6 years,
significantly older than the radio source.
  Most interestingly, the relative sizes of radio source and extended emission
line region suggest that both AGN and radio source are triggered at
approximately the same time.
  If both the triggering of the radio source activity and the formation of the
young stellar population had the same underlying cause, this source provides a
sequence for the events surrounding the triggering process. We propose that the
AGN activity in 9C J1503+4528 was causedby a relatively minor interaction, and
that a super-massive black hole powering the radio jets must have been in place
before the AGN was triggered.",2006-05-18T15:44:09Z
The Formation Histories of Metal-Rich and Metal-Poor Globular Clusters,"This review presents the results of ongoing studies of the formation
histories of metal-poor and metal-rich globular clusters and their host
galaxies. I first discuss the strong observational evidence that the globular
cluster systems of most elliptical galaxies have bimodal metallicity
distributions. I then focus on new results for metal-poor and metal-rich
globular cluster systems. Metal-poor globular clusters are often associated
with early structure formation, and I review new constraints on their formation
epoch based on the ``bias'' of the number of metal-poor clusters with host
galaxy mass. For metal-rich globular clusters, I discuss new results from
ongoing optical to near-infrared photometric studies which both confirm an
intermediate-age population in NGC 4365 and generally reveal a variety of
formation histories for now quiescent ellipticals.",2006-05-15T20:23:28Z
"Broad H-alpha wings from the optically thin stellar wind of the hot
  components in symbiotic binaries","Aims: To model broad H-alpha wings observed in symbiotic binaries by an
optically thin, bipolar stellar wind from their hot components as an
alternative to that considering the Raman scattering of Ly-beta photons on
atomic hydrogen. Methods: Profile-fitting analysis. Comparison of the observed
broad H-alpha wings and their luminosity with those predicted by the model.
Results: Synthetic H-alpha profiles fit excellently the observed wings for |RV|
> 200 km/s in our sample of 10 symbiotic stars during the quiescent as well as
active phases. The wing profile formed in the stellar wind can be approximated
by a function f(RV) proportional to RVexp-2, which is of the same type as that
arising from the Raman scattering. Therefore it is not possible to distinguish
between these two processes only by modeling the line profile. Some
observational characteristics of the H-alpha emission suggest the ionized
stellar wind from the hot component to be the dominant source contributing to
the H-alpha wings during active phases. The model corresponding mass-loss rates
from the hot components are of a few x 10exp(-8) M(Sun)/yr and of a few x
(10exp(-7) - 10exp(-6)) M(Sun)/yr during quiescent and active phases,
respectively.",2006-07-20T08:14:55Z
"Polarisation measurements with a CdTe pixel array detector for Laue hard
  X-ray focusing telescopes","Polarimetry is an area of high energy astrophysics which is still relatively
unexplored, even though it is recognized that this type of measurement could
drastically increase our knowledge of the physics and geometry of high energy
sources. For this reason, in the context of the design of a Gamma-Ray Imager
based on new hard-X and soft gamma ray focusing optics for the next ESA Cosmic
Vision call for proposals (Cosmic Vision 2015-2025), it is important that this
capability should be implemented in the principal on-board instrumentation. For
the particular case of wide band-pass Laue optics we propose a focal plane
based on a thick pixelated CdTe detector operating with high efficiency between
60-600 keV. The high segmentation of this type of detector (1-2 mm pixel size)
and the good energy resolution (a few keV FWHM at 500 keV) will allow high
sensitivity polarisation measurements (a few % for a 10 mCrab source in 106s)
to be performed. We have evaluated the modulation Q factors and minimum
detectable polarisation through the use of Monte Carlo simulations (based on
the GEANT 4 toolkit) for on and off-axis sources with power law emission
spectra using the point spread function of a Laue lens in a feasible
configuration.",2006-05-25T16:26:03Z
"Limits on the Transient Ultra-High Energy Neutrino Flux from Gamma-Ray
  Bursts (GRB) Derived from RICE Data","We present limits on ultra-high energy (UHE; E(nu)>1 PeV) neutrino fluxes
from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), based on recently presented data, limits, and
simulations from the RICE experiment. We use data from five recorded transients
with sufficient photon spectral shape and redshift information to derive an
expected neutrino flux, assuming that the observed photons are linked to
neutrino production through pion decay via the well-known 'Waxman-Bahcall'
prescription. Knowing the declination of the observed burst, as well as the
RICE sensitivity as a function of polar angle and the previously published
non-observation of any neutrino events allows an estimate of the sensitivity to
a given neutrino flux. Although several orders of magnitude weaker than the
expected fluxes, our GRB neutrino flux limits are nevertheless the first in the
PeV--EeV energy regime. For completeness, we also provide a listing of other
bursts, recorded at times when the RICE experiment was active, but requiring
some assumptions regarding luminosity and redshift to permit estimates of the
neutrino flux.",2006-05-19T15:15:59Z
Recognizing the First Radiation Sources Through Their 21-cm Signature,"At the beginning of the reionization epoch, radiation sources produce
fluctuations in the redshifted 21-cm background. We show that different types
of sources (such as miniquasars, Pop II and III stars, supernovae, etc.)
produce distinct signatures in the 21-cm signal radial profiles and statistical
fluctuations, through which they can be identified. Further, we show that the
21-cm signal from X-ray emitting sources is much easier to observe than was
expected, due to a previously neglected pumping mechanism.",2006-05-19T20:12:49Z
"The All-wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey (AEGIS)
  Data Sets","In this the first of a series of Letters, we present a description of the
panchromatic data sets that have been acquired in the Extended Groth Strip
region of the sky. Our survey, the All-wavelength Extended Groth strip
International Survey (AEGIS), is intended to study the physical properties and
evolutionary processes of galaxies at z ~ 1. It includes the following deep,
wide-field imaging data sets: Chandra/ACIS X-ray (0.5 - 10 keV), GALEX
ultraviolet (1200 - 2500 Angstrom), CFHT/MegaCam Legacy Survey optical (3600 -
9000 Angstroms), CFHT/CFH12K optical (4500 - 9000 Angstroms), Hubble Space
Telescope/ACS optical (4400 - 8500 Angstroms), Palomar/WIRC near-infrared (1.2
- 2.2 microns), Spitzer/IRAC mid-infrared (3.6 - 8.0 microns), Spitzer/MIPS
far-infrared (24 - 70 microns), and VLA radio continuum (6 - 20 cm). In
addition, this region of the sky has been targeted for extensive spectroscopy
using the DEIMOS spectrograph on the Keck II 10 m telescope. Our survey is
compared to other large multiwavelength surveys in terms of depth and sky
coverage.",2006-07-15T19:33:57Z
The Scientific Programme of Planck,"For 40 years, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) has been the most
important source of information about the geometry and contents of the
Universe. Even so, only a small fraction of the information available in the
CMB has been extracted to date. Planck, the third space CMB mission after COBE
and WMAP, is designed to extract essentially all of the information in the CMB
temperature anisotropies. Planck will also measure to high accuracy the
polarization of CMB anisotropies, which encodes not only a wealth of
cosmological information but also provides a unique probe of the thermal
history of the Universe during the time when the first stars and galaxies
formed. Polarization measurements may also detect the signature of a stochastic
background of gravitational waves generated during inflation, 10^(-35) s after
the Big Bang. This book describes the expected scientific output of the Planck
mission, both cosmological and non-cosmological. Chapter 1 summarizes the
experimental concept and the operation of the satellite. Chapter 2 covers the
core cosmological science of the mission, describing the measurements that
Planck will make, what we expect to learn from them about the geometry and
contents of the Universe and about fundamental physics, and the combination of
CMB data with other data to provide additional insights. Although the primary
goal of Planck is cosmology, it will survey the whole sky with an unprecedented
combination of frequency coverage, angular resolution, and sensitivity,
providing data valuable for a broad range of astrophysics. Chapters 3, 4, and 5
describe non-cosmological astrophysical uses of the Planck data. This book can
also be downloaded directly from http://www.rssd.esa.int/Planck .",2006-04-04T17:35:31Z
"Cosmological parameters from combining the Lyman-alpha forest with CMB,
  galaxy clustering and SN constraints","We combine the Ly-alpha forest power spectrum (LYA) from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) and high resolution spectra with cosmic microwave background
(CMB) including 3-year WMAP, and supernovae (SN) and galaxy clustering
constraints to derive new constraints on cosmological parameters. The existing
LYA power spectrum analysis is supplemented by constraints on the mean flux
decrement derived using a principle component analysis for quasar continua,
which improves the LYA constraints on the linear power. We find some tension
between the WMAP3 and LYA power spectrum amplitudes, at the ~2 sigma level,
which is partially alleviated by the inclusion of other observations: we find
\sigma_8=0.85\pm 0.02 compared to sigma_8=0.80 \pm 0.03 without LYA. For the
slope we find ns=0.965\pm0.012. We find no evidence for the running of the
spectral index in the combined analysis, dn/dln k=-(1.5\pm 1.2) x 10^{-2}, in
agreement with inflation. The limits on the sum of neutrino masses are
significantly improved: $\sum m_{\nu}<0.17\eV$ at 95% (<0.32eV at 99.9%). This
result, when combined with atmospheric and solar neutrino mixing constraints,
requires that the neutrino masses cannot be degenerate, m_3/m_1>1.3 (95% c.l.).
Assuming a thermalized fourth neutrino we find m_s<0.26\eV at 95% c.l. and such
neutrino cannot be an explanation for the LSND results. In the limits of
massless neutrinos we obtain the effective number of neutrinos N_\nu^{\rm
eff}=5.3^{+0.4}_{-0.6}{}^{+2.1}_{-1.7}{}^{+3.8}_{-2.5} and N_\nu^{\rm eff}=3.04
is allowed only at 2.4-sigma. The constraint on the dark energy equation of
state is w=-1.04\pm 0.06. The constraint on curvature is Omega_k=-0.003\pm
0.006. Cosmic strings limits are G\mu <2.3 x 10^{-7} at 95% c.l. and correlated
isocurvature models are also tightly constrained.",2006-04-14T19:45:32Z
"Comparing Dynamical and Photometric Mass Estimates of Low- and
  High-Redshift Galaxies: Random and Systematic Uncertainties","We determine the importance of redshift-dependent systematic effects in the
determination of stellar masses from broad band spectral energy distributions
(SEDs), using high quality kinematic and photometric data of early-type
galaxies at z~1 and z~0. We find that photometric masses of z~1 galaxies can be
systematically different, by up to a factor of 2, from photometric masses of
z~0 galaxies with the same dynamical mass. The magnitude of this bias depends
on the choice of stellar population synthesis model and the rest-frame
wavelength range used in the fits. The best result, i.e., without significant
bias, is obtained when rest-frame optical SEDs are fitted with models from
Bruzual&Charlot (2003). When the SEDs are extended to the rest-frame near-IR, a
bias is introduced: photometric masses of the z~1 galaxies increase by a factor
of 2 relative to the photometric masses of the z~0 galaxies. When we use the
Maraston (2005) models, the photometric masses of the z~1 galaxies are low
relative to the photometric masses of the z~0 galaxies by a factor of ~1.8.
This offset occurs both for fits based on rest-frame optical SEDs, and fits
based on rest-frame optical+near-IR SEDs. The results indicate that model
uncertainties produce uncertainties as high as a factor of 2.5 in mass
estimates from rest-frame near-IR photometry, independent of uncertainties due
to unknown star formation histories.",2006-07-28T15:40:52Z
Cold Dark Matter as Compact Composite Objects,"Dark Matter (DM) being the vital ingredient in the cosmos, still remains a
mystery. Standard assumption is that the collisionless cold dark matter (CCDM)
particles are represented by some weakly interacting fundamental fields which
can not be associated with any standard quarks or leptons. However, recent
analyses of structure on galactic and sub-galactic scales have suggested
discrepancies and stimulated numerous alternative proposals including, e.g.
Self-Interacting dark matter, Self-Annihilating dark matter, Decaying dark
matter, to name just a few. We propose the alternative to the standard
assumption about the nature of DM particles (which are typically assumed to be
weakly interacting fundamental point -like particles, yet to be discovered).
Our proposal is based on the idea that DM particles are strongly interacting
composite macroscopically large objects which made of well known light quarks
(or even antiquarks). The required weakness of the DM particle interactions is
guaranteed by a small geometrical factor of the composite objects with a large
baryon charge rather than by a weak coupling constant of a new field. We argue
that the interaction between hadronic matter and composite dark objects does
not spoil the desired properties of the latter as cold matter. We also argue
that such a scenario does not contradict to the current observational data.
Rather, it has natural explanations of many observed data, such as
$\Omega_{DM}/ \Omega_{B}\sim 1$ or $511 KeV$ line from the bulge of our galaxy.
We also suggest that composite dark matter may modify the dynamics of structure
formation in the central overdense regions of galaxies. We also present a
number of other cosmological/astrophysical observations which indirectly
support the novel concept of DM nature.",2006-03-02T21:05:50Z
"The INTEGRAL - HESS/MAGIC connection: a new class of cosmic high energy
  accelerators from keV to TeV","The recent completion and operation of the High Energy Stereoscopic System,
an array of ground based imaging Cherenkov telescopes, has provided a survey
with unprecedented sensitivity of the inner part of the Galaxy and revealed a
new population of very high energy gamma-rays sources emitting at E$>$100 GeV.
Most of them were reported to have no known radio or X-ray counterpart and
hypothesised to be representative of a new class of dark nucleonic cosmic
sources. In fact, very high energy gamma-rays with energies E $>$ 10$^{11}$ eV
are the best proof of non-thermal processes in the universe and provide a
direct in-site view of matter-radiation interaction at energies by far greater
than producible in ground accelerators. At lower energy INTEGRAL has regularly
observed the entire galactic plane during the first 1000 day in orbit providing
a survey in the 20-100 keV range resulted in a soft gamma-ray sky populated
with more than 200 sources, most of them being galactic binaries, either BHC or
NS. Very recently, the INTEGRAL new source IGR J18135-1751 has been identified
as the soft gamma-ray counterpart of HESS J1813-178 and AXJ1838.0-0655 as the
X/gamma-ray counterpart of HESS J1837-069.
  Detection of non thermal radio, X and gamma-ray emission from these TeV
sources is very important to discriminate between various emitting scenarios
and, in turn, to fully understand their nature.
  The implications of these new findings in the high energy Galactic population
will be addressed.",2006-05-09T11:43:30Z
Near-Horizon Solution for DGP Perturbations,"We develop a scaling ansatz for the master equation in Dvali, Gabadadze,
Porrati cosmologies, which allows us to solve the equations of motion for
perturbations off the brane during periods when the on-brane evolution is
scale-free. This allows us to understand the behavior of the gravitational
potentials outside the horizon at high redshifts and close to the horizon
today. We confirm that the results of Koyama and Maartens are valid at scales
relevant for observations such as galaxy-ISW correlation. At larger scales,
there is an additional suppression of the potential which reduces the growth
rate even further and would strengthen the ISW effect.",2006-06-13T00:53:26Z
Rotational and Cyclical Variability in gamma Cassiopeia,"We report results of a nine-year monitoring effort on the unusual classical
Be with a robotic ground-based (APT) B,V-filtered telescope as well as
simultaneous observations in 2004 November with this instrument and the RXTE
(X-ray) telescope. Our observations disclosed no correlated optical response to
the rapid X-ray flares in this star, nor did the star show any sustained flux
changes during the course of either of the two monitored nights in either
wavelength regime. Our optical light curves reveal that gamma Cas undergoes
\~3%-amplitude cycles with lengths of 60--90 days. Over the nine days we
monitored the star with the RXTE, the X-ray flux varied in phase with its
optical cycle and with an amplitude predicted from correlated optical/X-ray
data from an earlier paper. The amplitudes of the V magnitude cycles are
30--40% larger than the B amplitudes, suggesting the seat of the cycles is
circumstellar. The cycle lengths constantly change and can damp or grow on
timescales as short as 13 days. We have also discovered a coherent period of
1.21581 +/-0.00002 days in all our data, which is consistent only with
rotation. The full amplitude of this variation is 0.0060 in both filters. The
derived waveform, somewhat surprisingly, is almost sawtooth in shape. This
variation probably originates on the star's surface. This circumstance hints at
the existence of a strong magnetic field with a complex topology and an
associated heterogeneous surface composition.",2006-03-13T01:22:14Z
"Low Mass Stars and Brown Dwarfs in NGC 2024: Constraints on the
  Substellar Mass Function","We present results from a near-infrared spectroscopic study of candidate
brown dwarfs and low mass stars in the young cluster NGC 2024. Using FLAMINGOS
on the KPNO 2.1m and 4m telescopes, we have obtained spectra of ~70 new members
of the cluster and classified them via the prominent J and H band water
absorption features. Derived spectral types range from ~M1 to later than M8
with typical classification errors of 0.5-1 subclasses. By combining these
spectral types with JHK photometry, we place these objects on the H-R diagram
and use pre-main sequence evolutionary models to infer masses and ages. The
mean age for this low mass population of NGC 2024 is 0.5 Myr and derived masses
range from ~0.7-0.02 solar masses with 23 objects falling below the
hydrogen-burning limit. The logarithmic mass function rises to a peak at ~0.2
solar masses before turning over and declining into the substellar regime.
There is a possible secondary peak at ~0.035 solar masses however the errors
are also consistent with a flat IMF in this region. The ratio of brown dwarfs
to stars is similar to that found in the Trapezium but roughly twice the ratio
found in IC 348, leading us to conclude that the substellar IMF in young
clusters may be dependent on the local star forming environment.",2006-04-13T18:59:33Z
"Extending the redshift distribution of submm galaxies: Identification of
  a z~4 submm galaxy","We present the identification of a bright submillimeter galaxy (SMG) in the
field of Abell 2218. The galaxy has a spectroscopic redshift of ~4, and is
currently the highest redshift SMG known. It is detected at all wavelengths
from optical to submm, including the Spitzer IRAC bands. We discuss the
properties of this galaxy, which is undergoing intense star formation at a
rate~600 Msun/yr. We also compare the properties to those of radio-preselected
submm-bright galaxies. The z~4 result extends the redshift distribution of
SMGs.",2006-04-04T19:33:05Z
"Distribution of Matter from Singularity with Spherical Symmetry Using
  Fick Diffusion","A model is presented allowing calculation of energy and matter distribution
in the Universe after expansion from singularity without introduction of
expansion energy. Beginning with Fick's law of diffusion, we solve the Bessel
function for spherical systems during expansion, presuming isotropic matter
distribution in the Hubble flow. This function can be substituted with the
Associated Legendre differential equation and when solved we discover useful
parameters for those of energy and matter densities, diffusion and temperature.
Though we can follow the decline of matter density over spacetime, we cannot
suggest a precise value at singularity. This model may be useful though, as a
starting point for modeling star formation rates, SFR, galaxy formation horizon
lengths and regions devoid of matter where tracing the matter density decline
over time is important.",2006-05-12T12:02:03Z
Anatomy of A Dark Burst - The Afterglow of GRB 060108,"We report the first detection of an optical afterglow of a GRB (060108) that
would have been classified as 'dark' in the absence of deep, rapid ground-based
optical imaging with the 2-m robotic Faulkes Telesscope (FTN). Our
multiwavelength analysis reveals an X-ray light curve typical of many Swift
long GRBs (3-segments plus flare). Its optical afterglow, however, was already
fainter than the detection limit of the UVOT within 100s of the burst. Optical
imaging in BVRi' filters with the FTN began 2.75 minutes after the burst and
resulted in the detection of the optical afterglow at 5.3 minutes, with a UKIRT
K-band identification at ~45 mins. R and i'-band light curves are consistent
with a single power law decay in flux, F(t) prop t^-a where a=0.43+/-0.08, or a
2-segment light curve with a steep decay a_1 <0.88, flattening to a_2 ~ 0.31,
with evidence for rebrightening at i' band. Deep VLT R-band imaging at ~12 days
reveals a faint, extended object (R ~23.5 mag) at the location of the
afterglow. Although the brightness is compatible with the extrapolation of the
a_2 slow decay, significant flux is likely due to a host galaxy. This implies
that the optical light curve had a break before 12 days, akin to what observed
in the X-rays. We derive a maximum photometric redshift z<3.2 for GRB 060108
and a best-fitting optical-to-X-ray SED at 1000 s after the burst consistent
with a power law with index beta_OX = 0.54 and a small amount of extinction.
The unambiguous detection at B-band and the derived photometric redshift rule
out a high redshift as the reason for the optical faintness of GRB 060108.
Instead, the hard opt/X-ray spectral index confirms it as one of the
optically-darkest bursts detected and with modest host extinction explains the
UVOT non-detection (abridged).",2006-07-26T19:04:06Z
"The internal dynamics of the Local Group dwarf elliptical galaxies
  NGC147, NGC185, and NGC205","We present three-integral dynamical models for the three Local Group dwarf
elliptical galaxies: NGC147, NGC185, and NGC205. It is the first time models
are constructed for the Local Group dEs that allow for the presence of dark
matter at large radii and that are constrained by kinematics out to at least
one half-light radius. The B-band mass-to-light ratios of all three galaxies
are rather similar, (M/L)_B = 3-4. Within the inner two half-light radii, about
40-50% of the mass is in the form of dark matter, so dEs contain about as much
dark matter as bright ellipticals.
  NGC205 and NGC147 have a relatively isotropic velocity dispersion tensor
within the region where the internal dynamics are strongly constrained by the
data. Our estimated inclination for NGC185 is i ~ 50 degrees because in that
case the model has an intrinsic flattening close to the peak of the intrinsic
shape distribution of dEs and it, like the best fitting models for NGC147 and
NGC205, is nearly isotropic. We also show that the dynamical properties of the
bright nucleus of NGC205 are not unlike those of a massive globular cluster.",2006-03-25T15:12:51Z
Clusters and Groups of Galaxies in the Simulated Local Universe,"We compare the properties of galaxy groups extracted from the Updated Zwicky
Catalogue (UZC) with those of groups extracted from N-body simulations of the
local Universe, in a LambdaCDM and a tauCDM cosmology. In the simulations, the
initial conditions of the dark matter density field are set to reproduce the
present time distribution of the galaxies within 80 Mpc/h from the Milky Way.
These initial conditions minimize the uncertainty originated by cosmic
variance, which has affected previous analyses of this small volume of the
Universe. The simulations also model the evolution of the photometric
properties of the galaxy population with semi-analytic prescriptions. The
models yield a galaxy luminosity function sensibly different from that of the
UZC and are unable to reproduce the distribution of groups and their luminosity
content. The discrepancy between the model and the UZC reduces substantially,
if we redistribute the luminosity among the galaxies in the simulation
according to the UZC luminosity function while preserving the galaxy luminosity
rank. The modified LambdaCDM model provides the best match to the UZC: the
abundances of groups by harmonic radius, velocity dispersion, mass and
luminosity are consistent with observations. We find that this model also
reproduces the halo occupation number of groups and clusters. However, the
large-scale distribution of groups is marginally consistent with the UZC and
the redshift-space correlation function of galaxies on scales larger than 6
Mpc/h is still more than 3-sigma smaller than observed. We conclude that
reproducing the properties of the observed groups certainly requires a more
sophisticated treatment of galaxy formation, and possibly an improvement of the
dark matter model.",2006-06-23T15:44:54Z
Cosmic Reionization Redux,"We show that numerical simulations of reionization that resolve the Lyman
Limit systems (and, thus, correctly count absorptions of ionizing photons) have
converged to about 10% level for 5<z<6.2 and are in reasonable agreement
(within 10%) with the SDSS data in this redshift interval. The SDSS data thus
constraint the redshift of overlap of cosmic HII regions to z_{OVL} =
6.1+-0.15. At higher redshifts, the simulations are far from convergence on the
mean Gunn-Peterson optical depth, but achieve good convergence for the mean
neutral hydrogen fraction. The simulations that fit the SDSS data, however, do
not have nearly enough resolution to resolve the earliest episodes of star
formation, and are very far from converging on the precise value of the optical
depth to Thompson scattering - any value between 6 and 10% is possible,
depending on the convergence rate of the simulations and the fractional
contribution of PopIII stars. This is generally consistent with the third-year
WMAP results, but much higher resolution simulation are required to come up
with the sufficiently precise value for the Thompson optical depth that can be
statistically compared with the WMAP data.",2006-03-29T15:42:03Z
"An upper limit to the photon fraction in cosmic rays above 10^19 eV from
  the Pierre Auger Observatory","An upper limit of 16% (at 95% c.l.) is derived for the photon fraction in
cosmic rays with energies greater than 10^19 eV, based on observations of the
depth of shower maximum performed with the hybrid detector of the Pierre Auger
Observatory. This is the first such limit on photons obtained by observing the
fluorescence light profile of air showers. This upper limit confirms and
improves on previous results from the Haverah Park and AGASA surface arrays.
Additional data recorded with the Auger surface detectors for a subset of the
event sample, support the conclusion that a photon origin of the observed
events is not favored.",2006-06-26T09:06:55Z
"Consistency between deep crustal heating of strange stars in
  superbursters and soft X-ray transients","Both superbursters and soft X-ray transients probe the process of deep
crustal heating in compact stars. It was recently shown that the transfer of
matter from crust to core in a strange star can heat the crust and ignite
superbursts provided certain constraints on the strange quark matter equation
of state are fulfilled. We derive corresponding constraints on the equation of
state for soft X-ray transients assuming their quiescent emission is powered in
the same way, and further discuss the time dependence of this heating mechanism
in transient systems. We approach this using a simple parametrized model for
deep crustal heating in strange stars assuming slow neutrino cooling in the
core and blackbody photon emission from the surface.The constraints derived for
hot frequently accreting soft X-ray transients are always consistent with those
for superbursters. The colder sources are consistent for low values of the
quark matter binding energy, heat conductivity and neutrino emissivity. The
heating mechanism is very time dependent which may help to explain cold sources
with long recurrence times. Thus deep crustal heating in strange stars can
provide a consistent explanation for superbursters and soft X-ray transients.",2006-03-21T12:48:12Z
The History of Galaxy Formation in Groups: An Observational Perspective,"We present a pedagogical review on the formation and evolution of galaxies in
groups, utilizing observational information from the Local Group to galaxies at
z~6. The majority of galaxies in the nearby universe are found in groups, and
galaxies at all redshifts up to z~6 tend to cluster on the scale of nearby
groups (~1 Mpc). This suggests that the group environment may play a role in
the formation of most galaxies. The Local Group, and other nearby groups,
display a diversity in star formation and morphological properties that puts
limits on how, and when, galaxies in groups formed. Effects that depend on an
intragroup medium, such as ram-pressure and strangulation, are likely not major
mechanisms driving group galaxy evolution. Simple dynamical friction arguments
however show that galaxy mergers should be common, and a dominant process for
driving evolution. While mergers between L_* galaxies are observed to be rare
at z < 1, they are much more common at earlier times. This is due to the
increased density of the universe, and to the fact that high mass galaxies are
highly clustered on the scale of groups. We furthermore discus why the local
number density environment of galaxies strongly correlates with galaxy
properties, and why the group environment may be the preferred method for
establishing the relationship between properties of galaxies and their local
density.",2006-05-20T23:43:26Z
"What measurable zero point fluctuations can(not) tell us about dark
  energy","We show that laboratory experiments cannot measure the absolute value of dark
energy. All known experiments rely on electromagnetic interactions. They are
thus insensitive to particles and fields that interact only weakly with
ordinary matter. In addition, Josephson junction experiments only measure
differences in vacuum energy similar to Casimir force measurements. Gravity,
however, couples to the absolute value. Finally we note that Casimir force
measurements have tested zero point fluctuations up to energies of ~10 eV, well
above the dark energy scale of ~0.01 eV. Hence, the proposed cut-off in the
fluctuation spectrum is ruled out experimentally.",2006-05-30T07:57:16Z
"An alternative to grids and glasses: Quaquaversal pre-initial conditions
  for N-body simulations","N-body simulations sample their initial conditions on an initial particle
distribution, which for cosmological simulations is usually a glass or grid,
whilst a Poisson distribution is used for galaxy models, spherical collapse
etc. These pre-initial conditions have inherent correlations, noise due to
discreteness and preferential alignments, whilst the glass distribution is
poorly defined and computationally expensive to construct. We present a novel
particle distribution which can be useful as a pre-initial condition for N-body
simulations, using a simple construction based on a ``quaquaversal'' tiling of
space. This distribution has little preferred orientation (i.e. is
statistically isotropic), has a rapidly vanishing large scale power-spectrum
(P(k) ~ k^4), and is trivial to create. It should be particularly useful for
warm dark matter and cold collapse simulations.",2006-06-07T14:12:30Z
"The Unified Model of Active Galactic Nuclei: I. Non-hidden Broad Line
  Region Seyfert 2 and Narrow Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies","The unified model of Seyfert galaxies suggests that there are hidden
broad-line regions (HBLRs) in Seyfert 2 galaxies (S2s). However, there is
increasing evidence for the appearance of a subclass of S2s lacking of HBLR
(non-HBLR S2s). An interesting issue arises as to relations of non-HBLR S2s
with other types of Seyfert galaxies and whether or not they can be included in
the unified model. We assemble two sub-samples consisting of 42 non-HBLR S2s
and 44 narrow-line Seyfert 1s (NLS1s) with redshift $z\le 0.05$ from published
literatures to explore this issue. We compare black hole masses in the galactic
centers, accretion rates, infrared color ratio ($f_{60 \mu \rm m}/f_{25 \mu \rm
m}$) as a potential indicator of the dusty torus orientation, \oiii $\lambda
5007$, radio and far infrared luminosities. We find that non-HBLR S2s and NLS1s
have: 1) similar distributions of the black hole masses ($10^6-3\times
10^7\sunm$) and the Eddington ratios ($L_{\rm Bol}/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 1$); 2)
significantly different distributions of $f_{60 \mu \rm m}/f_{25 \mu \rm m}$
ratios; 3) similar distributions of bulge magnitudes and luminosities of [O
{\sc iii}], radio, far infrared emission. The similarities and differences can
be understood naturally if they are intrinsically same but non-HBLR S2s are
viewed at larger angles of observer's sight than NLS1s. We thus suggest that
non-HBLR S2s only have ""narrower"" broad line regions and they are the
counterparts of NLS1s viewed at high inclination angles. The absence of the
polarized emission line in non-HBLR S2s is caused by the less massive black
holes and high accretion rate similar to NLS1s. The implications of the
unification scheme of non-HBLR S2s and NLS1s are discussed.",2006-06-06T02:21:51Z
"Power Spectrum Analysis of Far-IR Background Fluctuations in 160 Micron
  Maps From the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer","We describe data reduction and analysis of fluctuations in the cosmic far-IR
background (CFIB) in observations with the Multiband Imaging Photometer for
Spitzer (MIPS) instrument 160 micron detectors. We analyzed observations of an
8.5 square degree region in the Lockman Hole, part of the largest low-cirrus
mapping observation with this instrument. We measured the power spectrum of the
CFIB in these observations by fitting a power law to the IR cirrus component,
the dominant foreground contaminant, and subtracting this cirrus signal. The
CFIB power spectrum in the range 0.2 arc min^{-1} <k< 0.5 arc min^{-1} is
consistent with previous measurements of a relatively flat component. However,
we find a large power excess at low k, which falls steeply to the flat
component in the range 0.03 arc min^{-1} <k< 0.1 arc min^{-1}. This low-k power
spectrum excess is consistent with predictions of a source clustering
""signature"". This is the first report of such a detection in the far-IR.",2006-04-25T04:14:25Z
"Connection between accretion disk and superluminal radio jets and the
  role of radio plateau state in GRS 1915+105","We investigate the association between the accretion disk during radio
plateau state and the following superluminal relativistic radio jets with peak
intensity varies from 200 mJy to 1000 mJy observed over a period of five years
and present the evidences of direct accretion disc-jet connection in
microquasar GRS 1915+105. We have analysed RXTE PCA/HEXTE X-ray data and have
found that the accretion rate, $\dot{m}_{accr}$, as inferred from the X-ray
flux, is very high during the radio plateaux. We suggest that the accretion
disk during the radio plateaux always associated with radiation-driven wind
which is manifested in the form of enhanced absorption column density for X-ray
and the depleted IR emission. We find that the wind density increases with the
accretion disk luminosity during the radio plateaux. The wind density is
similar to the density of the warm absorber proposed in extragalactic AGNs and
Quasars. We suggest a simple model for the origin of superluminal relativistic
jets. Finally, We discuss the implications of this work for galactic
microquasars and the extragalactic AGNs and Quasars.",2006-04-05T12:07:02Z
"The Joint Efficient Dark-energy Investigation (JEDI): Measuring the
  cosmic expansion history from type Ia supernovae","JEDI (Joint Efficient Dark-energy Investigation) is a candidate
implementation of the NASA-DOE Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM). JEDI will
probe dark energy in three independent methods: (1) type Ia supernovae, (2)
baryon acoustic oscillations, and (3) weak gravitational lensing. In an
accompanying paper, an overall summary of the JEDI mission is given. In this
paper, we present further details of the supernova component of JEDI. To derive
model-independent constraints on dark energy, it is important to precisely
measure the cosmic expansion history, H(z), in continuous redshift bins from z
\~ 0-2 (the redshift range in which dark energy is important). SNe Ia at z > 1
are not readily accessible from the ground because the bulk of their light has
shifted into the near-infrared where the sky background is overwhelming; hence
a space mission is required to probe dark energy using SNe. Because of its
unique near-infrared wavelength coverage (0.8-4.2 microns), JEDI has the
advantage of observing SNe Ia in the rest frame J band for the entire redshift
range of 0 < z < 2, where they are less affected by dust, and appear to be
nearly perfect standard candles. During the first year of JEDI operations,
spectra and light curves will be obtained for ~4,000 SNe Ia at z < 2. The
resulting constraints on dark energy are discussed, with special emphasis on
the improved precision afforded by the rest frame near-infrared data.",2006-06-28T19:39:42Z
Hydrogen in Type Ic Supernovae?,"By definition, a Type Ic supernova (SN Ic) does not have conspicuous lines of
hydrogen or helium in its optical spectrum. SNe Ic usually are modelled in
terms of the gravitational collapse of bare carbon-oxygen cores. We consider
the possibility that the spectra of ordinary (SN 1994I-like) SNe Ic have been
misinterpreted, and that SNe Ic eject hydrogen. An absorption feature usually
attributed to a blend of Si II 6355 and C II 6580 may be produced by H-alpha.
If SN 1994I-like SNe Ic eject hydrogen, the possibility that hypernova (SN
1998bw-like) SNe Ic, some of which are associated with gamma-ray bursts, also
eject hydrogen should be considered. The implications of hydrogen for SN Ic
progenitors and explosion models are briefly discussed.",2006-04-03T21:28:21Z
The Energy Transfer Process in Planetary Flybys,"We illustrate the energy transfer during planetary flybys as a function of
time using a number of flight mission examples. The energy transfer process is
rather more complicated than a monotonic increase (or decrease) of energy with
time. It exhibits temporary maxima and minima with time which then partially
moderate before the asymptotic condition is obtained. The energy transfer to
angular momentum is exhibited by an approximate Jacobi constant for the system.
We demonstrate this with flybys that have shown unexplained behaviors: i) the
possible onset of the ""Pioneer anomaly"" with the gravity assist of Pioneer 11
by Saturn to hyperbolic orbit (as well as the Pioneer 10 hyperbolic gravity
assist by Jupiter) and ii) the Earth flyby anomalies of small increases in
energy {\it in the geocentric system} (Galileo-I, NEAR, and Rosetta, in
additioon discussing the Cassini and Messenger flybys). Perhaps some small, as
yet unrecognized effect in the energy-transfer process can shed light on these
anomalies.",2006-08-03T17:00:24Z
"Filaments, Bubbles, and Weak Shocks in the Gaseous Atmosphere of M87","We present the first results from a 500 ksec Chandra ACIS-I observation of
M87. At soft energies (0.5-1.0 keV), we detect filamentary structures
associated with the eastern and southwestern X-ray and radio arms. Many
filaments are spatially resolved with widths of ~300 pc. This filamentary
structure is particularly striking in the eastern arm where we suggest the
filaments are outer edges of a series of plasma-filled, buoyant bubbles whose
ages differ by ~6 x 10^6 years. These X-ray structures may be influenced by
magnetic filamentation. At hard energies (3.5-7.5 keV), we detect a nearly
circular ring of outer radius 2.8' (13 kpc) which provides an unambiguous
signature of a weak shock, driven by an outburst from the SMBH. The density
rise in the shock is ~1.3 (Mach number, M~1.2). The observed spectral hardening
in the ring corresponds to a temperature rise T_shock / T_0 ~ 1.2, or M~1.2, in
agreement with the Mach number derived independently from the gas density.
Thus, for the first time, we detect gas temperature and density jumps
associated with a classical shock in the atmosphere around a supermassive black
hole. We also detect two additional surface brightness edges and pressure
enhancements at radii of ~0.6' and ~1'. The ~0.6' feature may be
over-pressurized thermal gas surrounding the relativistic plasma in the radio
cocoon, the ``piston'', produced by the current episode of AGN activity. The
over-pressurized gas is surrounded by a cool gas shell. The ~1' feature may be
an additional weak shock from a secondary outburst. In an earlier episode, the
``piston'' was responsible for driving the 2.8' shock.",2006-04-27T20:35:41Z
The Nature of Blue Early-Type Galaxies in the Goods Fields,"We present a study of the nature of the blue early-type galaxies (BEGs) in
the GOODS north and south fields using the GOODS HST/ACS archival data. Using
visual inspection, we have selected 58 BEGs and 113 normal red early-type
galaxies (REGs) in the sample of 1,949 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts.
We find that the BEGs are generally bluer, fainter, and less-massive than the
REGs, although a few BEGs are exceptionally bright and massive. The number
fraction of the BEGs to total early-type galaxies is almost constant
($\sim0.3$) at $z \le 1.1$. In addition, we find that the size of the BEGs in
given redshift bin decrease as redshift decreases. The BEGs look similar to the
REGs in the images and surface brightness profiles. However, at least 27 BEGs
show traces of tidal disturbances in their fine structures: elongated cores,
off-centered cores, asymmetric internal color distributions, tidally distorted
outer structures, collisional rings, or very nearby companions. Twenty-one BEGs
are detected in the X-ray bands and eleven of them are as luminous as
$L_{0.5-10 {\rm keV}} \ge 10^{43.5} {\rm erg~s}^{-1}$, indicating the existence
of AGNs in their centers. These results show that at least a half of the BEGs
may be descendants of mergers/interacting-galaxies and that at least a quarter
of the BEGs may be AGN-host galaxies. The BEGs may evolve into REGs, and the
size evolution of the BEGs is consistent with the galactic \emph{downsizing}
scenario.",2006-06-24T03:57:05Z
"Radio Emission on Sub-Parsec Scales from the Intermediate-Mass Black
  Hole in NGC 4395","The Seyfert 1 nucleus of NGC 4395 is energized by a black hole of 360,000
Solar masses (Peterson et al.), making it one of only two nuclear black holes
of intermediate mass, one thousand to one million Solar masses, detected in the
radio regime. Building upon UV and X-ray evidence for outflows from this
Seyfert nucleus, the VLBI High Sensitivity Array was used at 1.4 GHz to search
for extended structure on scales greater than 5 mas (0.1 pc). Elongated
emission was discovered, extending over 15 mas (0.3 pc) and suggesting an
outflow on sub-parsec scales from this intermediate-mass black hole. The
Seyfert nucleus is located at the center of an elliptical star cluster, and the
elongation position angle of the sub-parsec radio structure is only 19 degrees
from the star cluster's minor axis.",2006-06-23T20:37:02Z
"Comment on ""Heavy element production in inhomogeneous big bang
  nucleosynthesis""","The work of Matsuura et al. [Phys. Rev. D 72, 123505 (2005);
astro-ph/0507439] claims that heavy nuclei could have been produced in a
combined p- and r-process in very high baryon density regions of an
inhomogeneous big bang. However, they do not account for observational
constraints and previous studies which show that such high baryon density
regions did not significantly contribute to big bang abundances.",2006-04-12T09:54:44Z
"Dust Destruction in the High-Velocity Shocks Driven by Supernovae in the
  Early Universe","We investigate the destruction of dust grains by sputtering in the
high-velocity interstellar shocks driven by supernovae (SNe) in the early
universe to reveal the dependence of the time-scale of dust destruction on the
gas density $n_{{\rm H}, 0}$ in the interstellar medium (ISM) as well as on the
progenitor mass $M_{\rm pr}$ and explosion energy $E_{\rm 51}$ of SN. The
sputtering yields for the combinations of dust and ion species of interest to
us are evaluated by applying the so-called universal relation with a slight
modification. The dynamics of dust grains and their destruction by sputtering
in shock are calculated by taking into account the size distribution of each
dust species, together with the time evolution of temperature and density of
gas in spherically symmetric shocks. The results of calculations show that the
efficiency of dust destruction depends not only on the sputtering yield but
also on the initial size distribution of each grain species. The efficiency of
dust destruction increases with increasing $E_{\rm 51}$ and/or increasing
$n_{{\rm H}, 0}$, but is almost independent of $M_{\rm pr}$ as long as $E_{\rm
51}$ is the same. The mass of gas swept up by shock is the increasing function
of $E_{\rm 51}$ and the decreasing function of $n_{{\rm H}, 0}$. Combining
these results, we present the approximation formula for the time-scale of
destruction for each grain species in the early universe as a function of
$E_{\rm 51}$ and $n_{{\rm H}, 0}$. This formula is applicable for investigating
the evolution of dust grains at the early epoch of the universe with the
metallicity of $Z \la 10^{-3}$ $Z_\odot$. The effects of the cooling processes
of gas on the destruction of dust are briefly discussed.",2006-05-08T04:47:51Z
Infrared Sources in the Small Magellanic Cloud: First Results,"We have imaged the entire Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), one of the two
nearest star-forming dwarf galaxies, in all seven IRAC and MIPS bands. The low
mass and low metallicity (1/6 solar) of the SMC make it the best local analog
for primitive galaxies at high redshift. By studying the properties of dust and
star formation in the SMC at high resolution, we can gain understanding of
similar distant galaxies that can only be observed in much less detail. In this
contribution, we present a preliminary analysis of the properties of point
sources detected in the Spitzer Survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud (S^3MC).
We find ~400,000 unresolved or marginally resolved sources in our IRAC images,
and our MIPS 24 micron mosaic contains ~17,000 point sources. Source counts
decline rapidly at the longer MIPS wavelengths. We use color-color and
color-magnitude diagrams to investigate the nature of these objects,
cross-correlate their positions with those of known sources at other
wavelengths, and show examples of how these data can be used to identify
interesting classes of objects such as carbon stars and young stellar objects.
For additional examples of some of the questions that can be studied with these
data, please see the accompanying contributions by the other members of our
team. The mosaic images and point source catalogs we have made have been
released to the public on our website (http://celestial.berkeley.edu/spitzer).",2006-03-30T21:00:09Z
Flux predictions of high-energy neutrinos from pulsars,"Young, rapidly rotating neutron stars could accelerate ions from their
surface to energies of $\sim 1$ PeV. If protons reach such energies, they will
produce pions (with low probability) through resonant scattering with x-rays
from the stellar surface. The pions subsequently decay to produce muon
neutrinos. Here we calculate the energy spectrum of muon neutrinos, and
estimate the event rates at Earth. The spectrum consists of a sharp rise at
$\sim 50$ TeV, corresponding to the onset of the resonance, above which the
flux drops with neutrino energy as $\epsilon_\nu^{-2}$ up to an upper-energy
cut-off that is determined by either kinematics or by the maximum energy to
which protons are accelerated. We estimate event rates as high as 10-100
km^${-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ from some candidates, a flux that would be easily detected
by IceCube. Lack of detection would allow constraints on the energetics of the
poorly-understood pulsar magnetosphere.",2006-04-18T14:13:55Z
Cosmological acceleration from structure formation,"We discuss the Buchert equations, which describe the average expansion of an
inhomogeneous dust universe. In the limit of small perturbations, they reduce
to the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker equations. However, when the universe is very
inhomogeneous, the behaviour can be qualitatively different from the FRW case.
In particular, the average expansion rate can accelerate even though the local
expansion rate decelerates everywhere. We clarify the physical meaning of this
paradoxical feature with a simple toy model, and demonstrate how acceleration
is intimately connected with gravitational collapse. This provides a link to
structure formation, which in turn has a preferred time around the era when
acceleration has been observed to start.",2006-05-24T17:24:25Z
Is pulsar B0656+14 a very nearby RRAT source?,"The recently discovered RRAT sources are characterized by very bright radio
bursts which, while being periodically related, occur infrequently. We find
bursts with the same characteristics for the known pulsar B0656+14. These
bursts represent pulses from the bright end of an extended smooth pulse-energy
distribution and are shown to be unlike giant pulses, giant micropulses or the
pulses of normal pulsars. The extreme peak-fluxes of the brightest of these
pulses indicates that PSR B0656+14, were it not so near, could only have been
discovered as an RRAT source. Longer observations of the RRATs may reveal that
they, like PSR B0656+14, emit weaker emission in addition to the bursts.",2006-06-14T16:21:11Z
"Standing Accretion Shocks in the Supernova Core: Effects of Convection
  and Realistic EOS","We investigated the structure of the spherically symmetric accretion flows
through the standing shock wave onto the proto-neutron star in the post-bounce
phase of the collapse-driven supernova. We assume that the accretion flow is in
a steady state controlled by the neutrino luminosity and mass accretion rate
that are kept constant. We obtain solutions of the steady Euler equations for a
wide range of neutrino luminosity and mass accretion rate. We employ a
realistic EOS and neutrino-heating rates. More importantly, we take into
account the effect of convection phenomenologically. For each mass accretion
rate, we find the critical neutrino luminosity, above which there exists no
steady solution. These critical points are supposed to mark the onset of the
shock revival. As the neutrino luminosity increases for a given mass accretion
rate, there appears a convectively unstable region at some point before the
critical value is reached. We introduce a phenomenological energy flux by
convection so that the negative entropy gradient should be canceled out. We
find that the convection lowers the critical neutrino luminosity substantially.
We also consider the effect of the self-gravity. It is found that the
self-gravity is important only when the neutrino luminosity is high. The
critical luminosity, however, is little affected if the energy transport by
convection is taken into account.",2006-06-21T02:25:44Z
Asymmetric Spatiotemporal Evolution of Prebiotic Homochirality,"The role of asymmetry on the evolution of prebiotic homochirality is
investigated in the context of autocatalytic polymerization reaction networks.
A model featuring enantiometric cross-inhibition and chiral bias is used to
study the diffusion equations controlling the spatiotemporal development of
left and right-handed domains. Bounds on the chiral bias are obtained
consistent with present-day constraints on the emergence of life on early
Earth. The viability of biasing mechanisms such as weak neutral currents and
circularly polarized UV light is discussed. The results can be applied to any
hypothetical planetary platform.",2006-06-23T16:24:12Z
"Formation and Collapse of Nonaxisymmetric Protostellar Cores in Planar
  Magnetic Interstellar Clouds: Formulation of the Problem and Linear Analysis","We formulate the problem of the formation and collapse of nonaxisymmetric
protostellar cores in weakly ionized, self-gravitating, magnetic molecular
clouds. In our formulation, molecular clouds are approximated as isothermal,
thin (but with finite thickness) sheets. We present the governing dynamical
equations for the multifluid system of neutral gas and ions, including
ambipolar diffusion, and also a self-consistent treatment of thermal pressure,
gravitational, and magnetic (pressure and tension) forces. The dimensionless
free parameters characterizing model clouds are discussed. The response of
cloud models to linear perturbations is also examined, with particular emphasis
on length and time scales for the growth of gravitational instability in
magnetically subcritical and supercritical clouds. We investigate their
dependence on a cloud's initial mass-to-magnetic-flux ratio (normalized to the
critical value for collapse), the dimensionless initial neutral-ion collision
time, and also the relative external pressure exerted on a model cloud. Among
our results, we find that nearly-critical model clouds have significantly
larger characteristic instability lengthscales than do more distinctly sub- or
supercritical models. Another result is that the effect of a greater external
pressure is to reduce the critical lengthscale for instability. Numerical
simulations showing the evolution of model clouds during the linear regime of
evolution are also presented, and compared to the results of the dispersion
analysis. They are found to be in agreement with the dispersion results, and
confirm the dependence of the characteristic length and time scales on
parameters such as the initial mass-to-flux ratio and relative external
pressure.",2006-07-27T18:27:31Z
"The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Quasar Lens Search. I. Candidate Selection
  Algorithm","We present an algorithm for selecting an uniform sample of gravitationally
lensed quasar candidates from low-redshift (0.6<z<2.2) quasars brighter than
i=19.1 that have been spectroscopically identified in the SDSS. Our algorithm
uses morphological and color selections that are intended to identify small-
and large-separation lenses, respectively. Our selection algorithm only relies
on parameters that the SDSS standard image processing pipeline generates,
allowing easy and fast selection of lens candidates. The algorithm has been
tested against simulated SDSS images, which adopt distributions of field and
quasar parameters taken from the real SDSS data as input. Furthermore, we take
differential reddening into account. We find that our selection algorithm is
almost complete down to separations of 1'' and flux ratios of 10^-0.5. The
algorithm selects both double and quadruple lenses. At a separation of 2'',
doubles and quads are selected with similar completeness, and above (below) 2''
the selection of quads is better (worse) than for doubles. Our morphological
selection identifies a non-negligible fraction of single quasars: To remove
these we fit images of candidates with a model of two point sources and reject
those with unusually small image separations and/or large magnitude differences
between the two point sources. We estimate the efficiency of our selection
algorithm to be at least 8% at image separations smaller than 2'', comparable
to that of radio surveys. The efficiency declines as the image separation
increases, because of larger contamination from stars. We also present the
magnification factor of lensed images as a function of the image separation,
which is needed for accurate computation of magnification bias.",2006-05-22T20:01:54Z
"Testing Low-Mass Stellar Models: Three New Detached Eclipsing Binaries
  below 0.75 Msun","Full tests to stellar models below 1 Msun have been hindered until now by the
scarce number of precise measurements of the stars' most fundamental
parameters: their masses and radii. With the current observational techniques,
the required precision to distinguish between different models (errors < 2-3 %)
can only be achieved using detached eclipsing binaries where 1) both stars are
similar in mass, i.e. q = M1/M2 ~ 1.0, and 2) each star is a main sequence
object below 1 Msun.
  Until 2003 only three such binaries had been found and analyzed in detail.
Two new systems were published in 2005 (Creevey et al.; Lopez-Morales & Ribas),
almost doubling the previous number of data points. Here we present preliminary
results for 3 new low-mass detached eclipsing binaries. These are the first
studied systems from our sample of over 41 new binaries (Shaw & Lopez-Morales,
this proceedings). We also provide an updated comparison between the
Mass-Radius and the Mass-Teff relations predicted by the models and the
observational data from detached eclipsing binaries.",2006-03-28T04:55:39Z
Central Star Formation in Pseudobulges and Classical Bulges,"I use Spitzer 3.6-8.0 \mu m color profiles to compare the radial structure of
star formation in pseudobulges and classical bulges. Pseudobulges are
``bulges'' which form through secular evolution, rather than mergers. In this
study, pseudobulges are identified using the presence of disk-like structure in
the center of the galaxy (nuclear spiral, nuclear bar, and/or high ellipticity
in bulge); classical bulges are those galaxy bulges with smooth isophotes which
are round compared to the outer disk, and show no disky structure in their
bulge. I show that galaxies structurally identified as having pseudobulges have
higher central star formation rates than those of classical bulges. Further, I
also show that galaxies identified as having classical bulges have remarkably
regular star formation profiles. The color profiles of galaxies with classical
bulges show a star forming outer disk with a sharp change, consistent with a
decline in star formation rates, toward the center of the galaxy. Classical
bulges have a nearly constant inner profile (r < 1.5 kpc) that is similar to
elliptical galaxies. Pseudobulges in general show no such transition in star
formation properties from the outer disk to the central pseudobulge. Thus I
conclude that pseudobulges and classical bulges do in fact form their stars via
different mechanisms. Further, this adds to the evidence that classical bulges
form most of their stars in fast episodic bursts, in a similar fashion to
elliptical galaxies; whereas, pseudobulges form stars from longer lasting
secular processes.",2006-03-17T04:03:56Z
Probing Primordial Magnetic Fields with the 21cm Fluctuations,"Primordial magnetic fields possibly generated in the very early universe are
one of the candidates for the origin of magnetic fields observed in many
galaxies and galaxy clusters. After recombination, the dissipation process of
the primordial magnetic fields increases the baryon temperature. The Lorentz
force acts on the residual ions and electrons to generate density fluctuations.
These effects are imprinted on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) brightness
temperature fluctuations produced by the neutral hydrogen 21cm line. We
calculate the angular power spectrum of brightness temperature fluctuations for
the model with the primordial magnetic fields of a several nano Gauss strength
and a power-law spectrum. It is found that the overall amplitude and the shape
of the brightness temperature fluctuations depend on the strength and the
spectral index of the primordial magnetic fields. Therefore, it is expected
that the observations of the CMB brightness temperature fluctuations give us a
strong constraint on the primordial magnetic fields.",2006-07-10T08:08:25Z
Mass and Environment Drive the Evolution of Early-Type Galaxies,"New information has recently become available on the fundamental plane for
various samples of early-type galaxies with redshift up to 1.3, both in
clusters and in the field. This information is reviewed and clues are derived
on the evolution of spheroids over the last two thirds of the Universe lifetime
as a function of galaxy mass and environment, in comparison with the
predictions of the hierarchical models of galaxy formation. Using the Universe
as a time-machine and interpreting changes in M/L ratio as age differences, we
see that the age increases with galaxy mass in all environments, cluster
galaxies with any mass are older than field galaxies with the same mass, and
the age difference between cluster and field galaxies increases with mass. The
first two results confirm those obtained with other methods, and are reproduced
by the most recent incarnation of the hierarchical models, while the third
result is new and appears in contrast with the predictions of these models.",2006-07-14T10:14:42Z
Fourier phase analysis in radio-interferometry,"Most statistical tools used to characterize the complex structures of the
interstellar medium can be related to the power spectrum, and therefore to the
Fourier amplitudes of the observed fields. To tap into the vast amount of
information contained in the Fourier phases, one may consider the probability
distribution function (PDF) of phase increments, and the related concepts of
phase entropy and phase structure quantity. We use these ideas here with the
purpose of assessing the ability of radio-interferometers to detect and recover
this information. By comparing current arrays such as the VLA and Plateau de
Bure to the future ALMA instrument, we show that the latter is definitely
needed to achieve significant detection of phase structure, and that it will do
so even in the presence of a fair amount of atmospheric phase fluctuations. We
also show that ALMA will be able to recover the actual ""amount'' of phase
structure in the noise-free case, if multiple configurations are used.",2006-06-09T08:15:31Z
Determining the H+ Region/PDR Equation of State in Star Forming Regions,"The emission line regions of starburst galaxies and active nuclei reveal a
wealth of spectroscopic information. A unified picture of the relationship
between ionized, atomic, and molecular gas makes it possible to better
understand these observations. We performed a series of calculations designed
to determine the equation of state, the relationship between density,
temperature, and pressure, through emission-line diagnostic ratios that form in
the H+ region and PDR. We consider a wide range of physical conditions in the
H+ region. We connect the H+ region to the PDR by considering two constant
pressure cases, one with no magnetic field and one where the magnetic field
overwhelms the thermal pressure. We show that diagnostic ratios can yield the
equation of state for single H+ regions adjacent to single PDRs, with the
results being more ambiguous when considering observations of entire galaxies.
As a test, we apply our calculations to the Orion H+/PDR region behind the
Trapezium. We find the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure in the PDR to be
\~1.2. If magnetic and turbulent energy are in equipartition, our results mean
the magnetic field is not the cause of the unexplained broadening in M 42, but
may significantly affect line broadening in the PDR. Since Orion is often used
to understand physical processes in extragalactic environments, our
calculations suggest magnetic pressure should be considered in modeling such
regions.",2006-04-10T16:34:51Z
"Halo Shapes, Dynamics and Environment","In the hierarchical structure formation model cosmic halos are supposed to
form by accretion of smaller units along anisotropic direction, defined by
large-scale filamentary structures. After the epoch of primary mass aggregation
(which depend on the cosmological model), violent relaxation processes will
tend to alter the halo phase-space configuration producing quasi-spherical
halos with a relatively smooth density profiles.
  Here we attempt to investigate the relation between halos shapes, their
environment and their dynamical state. To this end we have run a large ($L=500
h^{-1}$ Mpc, $N_{p}=512^3$ particles) N-body simulation of a flat low-density
cold dark matter model with a matter density $\Omega_{\rm
m}=1-\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.3$, Hubble constant $H_{\circ}=70$ km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$ and a normalization parameter of $\sigma_{8}=0.9$. The particle mass
is $m_{\rm p}\ge 7.7\times 10^{10} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ comparable to the mass of
one single galaxy. The halos are defined using a friends-of-friend algorithm
with a linking length given by $l=0.17\bar{\nu}$ where $\bar{\nu}$ is the mean
density. This linking length corresponds to an overdensity $\rho/\rho_{\rm
mean}\simeq 200$ at the present epoch ($z=0$) and the total number of halos
with more than 130 particles ($M>3 \times 10^{13} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$) is 57524.",2006-04-07T11:35:28Z
"Images of Vega Dust Ring at 350 and 450 microns: New Clues to the
  Trapping of Multiple-Sized Dust Particles in Planetary Resonances","We have used the SHARC II camera at Caltech Submillimeter Observatory to make
350 and 450 micron images of the Vega dust disk at spatial resolutions (FWHM)
of 9.7"" and 11.1"", respectively. The images show a ring-like morphology (radius
\~ 100 AU) with inhomogeneous structure that is qualitatively different from
that previously reported at 850 microns and longer wavelengths. We attribute
the 350/450 micron emission to a grain population whose characteristic size (~
1 mm) is intermediate between that of the cm-sized grains responsible for
emission longward of 850 microns and the much smaller grains (< 18 microns) in
the extensive halo, visible at 70 microns, discussed by Su et al. (2005). We
have combined our submillimeter images with Spitzer data at 70 microns to
produce 2-d maps of line-of-sight optical depth (relative column density).
These ""tau maps"" suggest that the mm-sized grains are located preferentially in
three symmetrically-located concentrations. If so, then this structure could be
understood in terms of the Wyatt (2003) model in which planetesimals are
trapped in the mean motion resonances of a Neptune-mass planet at 65 AU,
provided allowance is made for the spatial distribution of dust grains to
differ from that of the parent planetesimals. The peaks of the tau maps are, in
fact, located near the expected positions corresponding to the 4:3 resonance.
If this identification is confirmed by future observations, it would resolve an
ambiguity with regard to the location of the planet.",2006-06-14T16:53:02Z
Deep 1.4 GHz VLA Observations of the Radio Halo and Relic in Abell 2256,"We present deep VLA observations of the merging galaxy cluster Abell 2256.
This cluster is known to possess diffuse steep spectrum radio relic emission in
the peripheral regions. Our new observations provide the first detailed image
of the central diffuse radio halo emission in this cluster. The radio halo
extends over more than 800 kpc in the cluster core, while the relic emission
covers a region of ~1125 x 520 kpc. A spectral index map of the radio relic
shows a spectral steepening from the northwest toward the southeast edge of the
emission, with an average spectral index between 1369 MHz and 1703 MHz of -1.2
across the relic. Polarization maps reveal high fractional polarization of up
to 45% in the relic region with an average polarization of 20% across the relic
region. The observed Faraday rotation measure is consistent with the Galactic
estimate and the dispersion in the rotation measure is small, suggesting that
there is very little contribution to the rotation measure of the relic from the
intracluster medium. We use these Faraday properties of the relic to argue that
it is located on the front side of the cluster.",2006-03-07T18:30:46Z
A Reverberation-Based Mass for the Central Black Hole in NGC 4151,"We have undertaken a new ground-based monitoring campaign to improve the
estimates of the mass of the central black hole in NGC 4151. We measure the lag
time of the broad H beta line response compared to the optical continuum at
5100 A and find a lag of 6.6 (+1.1/-0.8) days. We combine our data with the
recent reanalysis of UV emission lines by Metzroth et al. to calculate a
weighted mean of the black hole mass, M_BH = 4.57 (+0.57/-0.47) x 10^7 M_sun.
The absolute calibration of the black hole mass is based on normalization of
the AGN black hole mass - stellar velocity dispersion (M_BH - sigma_*)
relationship to that of quiescent galaxies by Onken et al. The scatter in the
M_BH - sigma_* relationship suggests that reverberation-mapping based mass
measurements are typically uncertain by a factor of 3-4.",2006-07-05T20:01:36Z
SZ Surveys are Coming: What should we do?,"Galaxy clusters furnish extremely rich information on the contents and
structure of our universe. The potential of galaxy cluster studies to constrain
dark energy, for example, motivates a number of ambitious cluster surveys.
Among these, surveys based on the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect are
particularly powerful for their ability to cleanly select clusters out to
redshifts z>1. Now poised to begin surveying substantial areas of sky,
dedicated interferometers, bolometer cameras and the Planck satellite will soon
produce large cluster catalogs that will provide a precise measure of the
cosmic expansion rate over a range of redshifts and precipitate a new
understanding of structure and galaxy formation. I review the science potential
of these surveys and examine some issues of SZ cluster catalog construction.",2006-06-09T18:30:25Z
Magnetospheric Gap and Accumulation of Giant Planets Close to the Star,"The bunching of giant planets at a distance of several stellar radii may be
explained by the disruption of the inner part of the disk by the magnetosphere
of the star during the T Tauri stage of evolution. The rotating magnetic field
of the star gives rise to a low density magnetospheric gap where stellar
migration is strongly suppressed. We performed full 3D magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of the disk-magnetosphere interaction and examined conditions for
which the magnetospheric gap is ""empty"", by changing the misalignment angle
between magnetic and rotational axes of the star, Theta, and by lowering the
adiabatic index gamma, which mocks up the effect of heat conductivity and
cooling. Our simulations show that for a wide range of plausible conditions the
gap is essentially empty. However, in the case of large misalignment angles
Theta, part of the funnel stream is located in the equatorial plane and the gap
is not empty. Furthermore, if the adiabatic index is small (gamma=1.1) and the
rotational and magnetic axes are almost aligned, then matter penetrates through
the magnetosphere due to 3D instabilities forming high-density equatorial
funnels. For these two limits there is appreciable matter density in the
equatorial plane of the disk so that a planet may migrate into the star.",2006-06-08T00:27:20Z
Neutrino Coannihilation on Dark-Matter Relics?,"High-energy neutrinos may resonate with relic background neutralinos to form
short-lived sneutrinos. In some circumstances, the decay chain that leads back
to the lightest supersymmetric particle would yield few-GeV gamma rays or
charged-particle signals. Although resonant coannihilation would occur at an
appreciable rate in our galaxy, the signal in any foreseeable detector is
unobservably small.",2006-04-10T20:00:15Z
Evidence for variable outflows in the Young Stellar Object V645 Cygni,"As part of the Red MSX Source Survey of Massive Young Stellar Objects (MYSOs)
we have conducted multi-wavelength follow up observations of the well-known
object V645 Cygni. We present our data on this object, whose near-infrared
spectrum is exceptional and place these in context with previous observations.
Our observations of V645 Cyg included near/mid infrared imaging observations,
13CO 2-1 line observations and high signal-to-noise velocity resolved
near-infrared spectroscopy. The spectrum shows P-Cygni hydrogen Brackett
emission, consistent with a high velocity stellar wind. A red-shifted emission
component to a number of near-IR emission lines was also uncovered. This is
associated with a similar component in the H alpha line. V645 Cyg is also found
to have variable CO first overtone bandhead emission. The data clearly indicate
that the outflow of V645 Cyg is variable. The unidentified feature in a
previously published optical spectrum is identified with a receding outflow at
2000 km per second. The nature of this feature, which is found in hydrogen and
helium atomic lines and CO molecular lines remains a puzzle.",2006-06-27T12:44:30Z
Stellar winds from massive stars - What are the REAL mass-loss rates?,"We discuss recent evidence that currently accepted mass-loss rates may need
to be revised downwards, as a consequence of previously neglected ``clumping''
of the wind. New results on the radial stratification of the corresponding
clumping factors are summarized. We investigate the influence of clumping on
the ionization equilibrium of phosphorus, which is of major relevance when
deriving constraints on the clumping factors from an analysis of the FUV PV
resonance lines.",2006-07-13T06:34:36Z
The Size-Frequency Distribution of Dormant Jupiter Family Comets,"We estimate the total number and the slope of the size frequency distribution
(SFD) of dormant Jupiter Family Comets (JFCs) by fitting a one-parameter model
to the known population. We first select 61 Near Earth Objects (NEOs) that are
likely to be dormant JFCs because their orbits are dynamically coupled to
Jupiter (Bottke et al, 2002). Then, from the numerical simulations of Levison &
Duncan (1997), we construct an orbit distribution model for JFCs in the NEO
orbital element space. We assume an orbit independent SFD for all JFCs, the
slope of which is our unique free parameter. Finally, we compute observational
biases for dormant JFCs using a calibrated NEO survey simulator (Jedicke et al.
2003). By fitting the biased model to the data, we estimate that there are ~75
dormant JFCs with H<18 in the NEO region and that the slope of their cumulative
SFD is -1.5 +/- 0.3. Our slope for the SFD of dormant JFCs is very close to
that of active JFCs as determined by Weissman and Lowry (2003). Thus, we argue
that when JFCs fade they are likely to become dormant rather than to disrupt
and that the fate of faded comets is size independent. Our results imply that
the size distribution of the JFC progenitors - the scattered disk
trans-Neptunian population - either (i) has a similar and shallow SFD or (i')
is slightly steeper and physical processes acting on the comets in a
size-dependent manner creates the shallower active comet SFD. Our measured
slope, typical of collisionally evolved populations with a size dependent
impact strength (Benz and Asphaug 1999), suggests that scattered disk bodies
reached collisional equilibrium inside the proto-planetary disk prior to their
removal from the planetary region.",2006-03-04T02:37:38Z
"Photoevaporation of protoplanetary discs II: evolutionary models and
  observable properties","We present a new model for protoplanetary disc evolution. This model combines
viscous evolution with photoevaporation of the disc, in a manner similar to
Clarke, Gendrin & Sotomayor (2001). However in a companion paper (Alexander,
Clarke & Pringle 2006a) we have shown that at late times such models must
consider the effect of stellar radiation directly incident on the inner disc
edge, and here we model the observational implications of this process. We find
that the entire disc is dispersed on a time-scale of order $10^5$yr after a
disc lifetime of a few Myr, consistent with observations of T Tauri (TT) stars.
We use a simple prescription to model the spectral energy distribution of the
evolving disc, and demonstrate that the model is consistent with observational
data across a wide range of wavelengths. We note also that the model predicts a
short ``inner hole'' phase in the evolution of all TT discs, and make
predictions for future observations at mid-infrared and millimetre wavelengths.",2006-03-09T23:29:08Z
Luminosity Function of Faint Globular Clusters in M87,"We present the luminosity function to very faint magnitudes for the globular
clusters in M87, based on a 30 orbit \textit{Hubble Space Telescope (HST)}
WFPC2 imaging program. The very deep images and corresponding improved false
source rejection allow us to probe the mass function further beyond the
turnover than has been done before. We compare our luminosity function to those
that have been observed in the past, and confirm the similarity of the turnover
luminosity between M87 and the Milky Way. We also find with high statistical
significance that the M87 luminosity function is broader than that of the Milky
Way. We discuss how determining the mass function of the cluster system to low
masses can constrain theoretical models of the dynamical evolution of globular
cluster systems. Our mass function is consistent with the dependence of mass
loss on the initial cluster mass given by classical evaporation, and somewhat
inconsistent with newer proposals that have a shallower mass dependence. In
addition, the rate of mass loss is consistent with standard evaporation models,
and not with the much higher rates proposed by some recent studies of very
young cluster systems. We also find that the mass-size relation has very little
slope, indicating that there is almost no increase in the size of a cluster
with increasing mass.",2006-07-11T20:09:55Z
"Constraining dark matter halo profiles and galaxy formation models using
  spiral arm morphology. I. Method outline","We investigate the use of spiral arm pitch angles as a probe of disk galaxy
mass profiles. We confirm our previous result that spiral arm pitch angles (P)
are well-correlated with the rate of shear (S) in disk galaxy rotation curves,
by using a much larger sample (51 galaxies) than used previously (17 galaxies).
We use this correlation to argue that imaging data alone can provide a powerful
probe of galactic mass distributions out to large lookback times. In contrast
to previous work, we show that observed spiral arm pitch angles are similar
when measured in the optical (at 0.4 um) and the near-infrared (at 2.1 um) with
a mean difference of 2.3+/-2.7 degrees. This is then used to strengthen the
known correlation between P and S using B-band images. We then use two example
galaxies to demonstrate how an inferred shear rate coupled with a bulge-disk
decomposition model and a Tully-Fisher derived velocity normalization can be
used to place constraints on a galaxy's baryon fraction and dark matter halo
profile. We show that ESO 582-G12, a galaxy with a high shear rate (slightly
declining rotation curve) at ~10 kpc, favors an adiabatically contracted halo,
with high initial NFW concentration (c_vir > 16) and a high fraction of halo
baryons in the form of stars (~15-40%). In contrast, IC 2522 has a low shear
rate (rising rotation curve) at ~10 kpc and favors non-adiabatically contracted
models with low NFW concentrations (c_vir ~ 2-8) and a low stellar baryon
fraction <10%.",2006-03-22T22:18:32Z
"The Correlation of Narrow Line Emission and X-ray Luminosity in Active
  Galactic Nuclei","We combine emission line and X-ray luminosities for 45 sources from the
Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S), and seven HELLAS sources, to obtain a new
sample of 52 X-ray selected type-II active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Eighteen of
our sources are very luminous with a typical, absorption-corrected 2-10 keV
luminosity of few 10^{44} erg/sec (type-II QSOs). We compare the emission line
properties of the new sources with emission line and X-ray luminosities of
known low redshift, mostly lower luminosity AGNs by using a composite spectrum.
We find that ${\rm L_{[OIII]}}$/${\rm L_{2-10}}$ and ${\rm L_{[OII]}}$/${\rm
L_{2-10}}$ decrease with L(2-10 keV) such that ${\rm L_{[OIII]}}/{\rm L_{2-10}}
\propto {\rm L_{2-10}}^{-0.42}$. The trend was already evident, yet neglected
in past low redshift samples. This lead to erroneous calibration of the
line-to-X-ray luminosity in earlier AGN samples. The analysis of several type-I
samples shows the same trend with a similar slope but a median ${\rm
L_{[OIII]}}$/${\rm L_{2-10}}$ which is larger by a factor of about two compared
with optically selected type-II samples. We interpret this shift as due to
additional reddening in type-II sources and comment in general on the very
large extinction in many type-II objects and the significantly smaller average
reddening of the SDSS type-II AGNs. The decrease of ${\rm L_{[OIII]}}$/${\rm
L_{2-10}}$ with L(2--10 keV) is large enough to suggest that a significant
fraction of high luminosity high redshift type-II AGNs have very weak emission
lines that may have escaped detection in large samples. A related decrease of
EW([OIII]) with optical continuum luminosity is demonstrated by an analysis of
12,000 type-I SDSS AGNs.",2006-03-27T07:16:40Z
Star formation in the vicinity of the IC 348 cluster,"Aims. We present molecular line observations of the southwestern part of the
IC 348 young cluster, and we use them together with NIR and mm continuum data
to determine the distribution of dense gas, search for molecular outflows, and
analyze the ongoing star formation activity in the region. Methods. Our
molecular line data consists of C18O(1--0) and N2H+(1--0) maps obtained with
the FCRAO telescope at a resolution of about 50'' and CO(2--1) data obtained
with the IRAM 30m telescope at a resolution of 11''. Results. The dense gas
southwest of IC 348 is concentrated in two groups of dense cores, each of them
with a few solar masses of material and indications of CO depletion at high
density. One of the core groups is actively forming stars, while the other
seems starless. There is evidence for at least three bipolar molecular outflows
in the region, two of them powered by previously identified Class 0 sources,
while the other one is powered by a still not well characterized low-luminosity
object. The ongoing star formation activity is producing a small stellar
subgroup in the cluster. Using the observed core characteristics and the star
formation rate in the cluster we propose that that similar episodes of stellar
birth may have produced the subclustering observed in the halo of IC 348.",2006-06-15T20:04:47Z
Neutrino signatures of supernova turbulence,"Convection that develops behind the shock front during the first second of a
core-collapse supernova explosion is believed to play a crucial role in the
explosion mechanism. We demonstrate that the resulting turbulent density
fluctuations may be directly observable in the neutrino signal starting at t>~
3-4 s after the onset of the explosion. The effect comes from the modulation of
the MSW flavor transformations by the turbulent density fluctuations. We derive
a simple and general criterion for neutrino flavor depolarization in a
Kolmogorov-type turbulence and apply it to the turbulence seen in modern
numerical simulations. The turbulence casts a ""shadow"", by making other
features, such as the shock front, unobservable in the density range covered by
the turbulence.",2006-07-12T19:16:59Z
Indirect signatures for axion(-like) particles,"Magnetic field dependent transient solar observations are suggestive for
axion-photon oscillations with light axion(-like) particle involvement. Novel
dark-moon measurements with the SMART X-ray detectors can be conclusive for
radiatively decaying massive exotica like the generic solar Kaluza-Klein
axions. Furthermore, the predicted intrinsic strong solar magnetic fields could
be the reason of enhanced low energy axion production. Such an axion component
could be the as yet unknown origin of the strong quiet Sun X-ray luminosity at
energies below 1 keV. Solar axion telescopes should lower their threshold,
aiming to copy processes that might occur near the solar surface, be it due to
spontaneous or magnetically induced radiative decay of axion(-like) particles.
This is motivated also by the recent claim of an axion-like particle detection
by the laser experiment PVLAS.",2006-03-18T19:17:20Z
GRB030406 an extremely hard burst outside of the INTEGRAL field of view,"Using the IBIS Compton mode, the INTEGRAL satellite is able to detect and
localize bright and hard GRBs, which happen outside of the nominal INTEGRAL
telescopes field of view. We have developed a method of analyzing such INTEGRAL
data to obtain the burst location and spectra. We present the results for the
case of GRB030406. The burst is localized with the Compton events, and the
location is consistent with the previous Interplanetary Network position. A
spectral analysis is possible with the detailed modeling of the detector
response for such a far off-axis source with the offset of 36.9 $^\circ$. The
average spectrum of the burst is extremely hard: the photon index above 400
\kev is -1.7, with no evidence of a break up to 1.1 \mev at 90% confidence
level.",2006-04-20T15:11:22Z
Extended Lyman alpha emission around bright quasars,"Quasars trace the most massive structures at high redshifts and their
presence may influence the evolution of the massive host galaxies. We study the
extended Lyman alpha emission line regions (EELRs) around seven bright, mostly
radio-quiet quasars (QSOs) at 2.7<z<4.5, and compare luminosities with EELRs
around radio-loud QSOs reported in the literature. Using integral field
spectroscopy, we analyse the morphology and kinematics of the quiescent Lya
EELRs around the QSOs. We find evidence for the presence of EELRs around four
radio-quiet and one radio-loud QSO. All EELRs appear asymmetric and the
optically brightest QSOs also have the brightest Lya nebulae. For the two
brightest nebulae we find velocities between ~600 km s^-1 at the QSO position
to ~200 km s^-1 at a distance of 3-4 arcsec from the QSO and surface flux
densities up to 2-3*10^{-16} erg cm^-2 s^-1 arcsec^-2. The five EELRs have
total Lya luminosities which correspond to ~0.5% of the luminosities from the
QSOs broad Lya emission lines. This fraction is an order of magnitude smaller
than found for EELRs around radio-loud, steep spectrum QSOs reported in the
literature. While the nebulae luminosities are correlated with the QSO Lya
luminosities, we find that nebulae luminosities are not correlated with the
central QSO ionising fluxes. The presence of gas in the EELRs can be
interpreted based on two competing scenarios: either from quasar feedback
mechanisms, or from infalling matter. Apart from these two effects, the Lya
flux around radio-loud objects can be enhanced due to interactions with the
radio jets. The relatively fainter nebulae around radio-quiet QSOs compared to
lobe-dominated radio-loud QSOs can be ascribed to this effect, or to
significant differences in the environments between the two classes.",2006-03-30T21:26:22Z
"First direct detection of a Keplerian rotating disk around the Be star
  $α$ Arae using the VLTI/AMBER instrument","Aims. We aim to study the geometry and kinematics of the disk around the Be
star $\alpha$ Arae as a function of wavelength, especially across the
Br$\gamma$ emission line. The main purpose of this paper is to answer the
question about the nature of the disk rotation around Be stars. Methods. We use
the VLTI/AMBER instrument operating in the K band which provides a gain by a
factor 5 in spatial resolution compared to previous VLTI/MIDI observations.
Moreover, it is possible to combine the high angular resolution provided with
the (medium) spectral resolution of AMBER to study the kinematics of the inner
part of the disk and to infer its rotation law. Results. We obtain for the
first time the direct evidence that the disk is in keplerian rotation,
answering a question that occurs since the discovery of the first Be star
$\gamma$ Cas by father Secchi in 1866. We also present the global geometry of
the disk showing that it is compatible with a thin disk + polar enhanced winds
modeled with the SIMECA code. We found that the disk around $\alpha$ Arae is
compatible with a dense equatorial matter confined in the central region
whereas a polar wind is contributing along the rotational axis of the central
star. Between these two regions the density must be low enough to reproduce the
large visibility modulus (small extension) obtained for two of the four VLTI
baselines. Moreover, we obtain that $\alpha$ Arae is rotating very close to its
critical rotation. This scenario is also compatible with the previous MIDI
measurements.",2006-06-16T12:52:53Z

"Solar differential rotation and meridional flow: The role of a
  subadiabatic tachocline for the Taylor-Proudman balance","We present a simple model for the solar differential rotation and meridional
circulation based on a mean field parameterization of the Reynolds stresses
that drive the differential rotation. We include the subadiabatic part of the
tachocline and show that this, in conjunction with turbulent heat conductivity
within the convection zone and overshoot region, provides the key physics to
break the Taylor-Proudman constraint, which dictates differential rotation with
contour lines parallel to the axis of rotation in case of an isentropic
stratification. We show that differential rotation with contour lines inclined
by 10 - 30 degrees with respect to the axis of rotation is a robust result of
the model, which does not depend on the details of the Reynolds stress and the
assumed viscosity, as long as the Reynolds stress transports angular momentum
toward the equator. The meridional flow is more sensitive with respect to the
details of the assumed Reynolds stress, but a flow cell, equatorward at the
base of the convection zone and poleward in the upper half of the convection
zone, is the preferred flow pattern.",2006-04-21T00:17:07Z
"Speckle nulling for exoplanet detection with space-based coronagraphic
  telescopes","To detect Earth-like planets in the visible with a coronagraphic telescope,
two major noise sources have to be overcome: the photon noise of the diffracted
star light, and the speckle noise due to the star light scattered by
instrumental defects. Coronagraphs tackle only the photon noise contribution.
In order to decrease the speckle noise below the planet level, an active
control of the wave front is required. We have developed analytical methods to
measure and correct the speckle noise behind a coronagraph with a deformable
mirror. In this paper, we summarize these methods, present numerical
simulations, and discuss preliminary experimental results obtained with the
High-Contrast Imaging Testbed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.",2006-06-13T00:50:12Z
"The coherence of kHz quasi-periodic oscillations in the X-rays from
  accreting neutron stars","We study in a systematic way the quality factor of the lower and upper kHz
QPOs in a sample of low luminosity neutron star X-ray binaries, showing both
QPOs varying over a wide frequency range. The sample includes 4U 1636-536, 4U
1608-522, 4U 1735-44, 4U 1728-34, 4U 1820-303 and 4U 0614+09. We find that all
sources except 4U 0614+091 show evidence of a drop in the quality factor of
their lower kHz QPOs at high frequency. For 4U 0614+091 only the rising part of
the quality factor versus frequency curve has been sampled so far. At the same
time, in all sources but 4U 1728-34, the quality factor of the upper kilo-Hz
QPO increases all the way to the highest detectable frequencies. We show that
the high-frequency behaviours of both the lower and upper kHz QPO quality
factors are consistent with what is expected if the drop is produced by the
approach of an active oscillating region to the innermost stable circular
orbit: the existence of which is a key feature of General Relativity in the
strong field regime. Within this interpretation, our results imply
gravitational masses around 2 solar masses for the neutron stars in those
systems.",2006-05-19T09:30:49Z
Cleaning up Eta Carinae: Detection of Ammonia in the Homunculus,"We report the first detection of ammonia in the Homunculus nebula around eta
Carinae, which is also the first detection of emission from a polyatomic
molecule in this or any other luminous blue variable (LBV) nebula. Observations
of the NH3 (J,K)=(3,3) inversion transition made with the Australia Telescope
Compact Array reveal emission at locations where infrared H2 emission had been
detected previously, near the strongest dust emission in the core of the
Homunculus. We also detect ammonia emission from the so-called ``strontium
filament'' in the equatorial disk. The presence of NH3 around eta Car hints
that molecular shells around some Wolf-Rayet stars could have originated in
prior LBV eruptions, rather than in cool red supergiant winds or the ambient
interstellar medium. Combined with the lack of any CO detection, NH3 seems to
suggest that the Homunculus is nitrogen rich like the ionized ejecta around eta
Car. It also indicates that the Homunculus is a unique laboratory in which to
study unusual molecule and dust chemistry, as well as their rapid formation in
a nitrogen-rich environment around a hot star. We encourage future observations
of other transitions like NH3 (1,1) and (2,2), related molecules like N2H+, and
renewed attempts to detect CO.",2006-05-22T00:07:04Z
Galactic Warps Induced By Cosmic Infall,"Recent ideas for the origin and persistence of the warps commonly observed in
disc galaxies have focused on cosmic infall. We present N-body simulations of
an idealized form of cosmic infall onto a disc galaxy and obtain a warp that
closely resembles those observed. The inner disc tilts remarkably rigidly,
indicating strong cohesion due to self-gravity. The line of nodes of the warp
inside $R_{26.5} ~ 4.5 \Rd$ is straight, while that beyond $R_{26.5}$ generally
forms a loosely-wound, leading spiral in agreement with Briggs's rules. We
focus on the mechanism of the warp and show that the leading spiral arises from
the torques from the misaligned inner disc and its associated inner oblate
halo. The fact that the line of nodes of most warps forms a leading spiral
might imply that the disc mass is significant in the centre. If the line of
nodes can be traced to very large radii in future observations, it may reveal
information on the mass distribution of the outer halo. The warp is not
strongly damped by the halo because the precession rate of the inner disc is
slow and the inner halo generally remains aligned with the inner disc. Thus
even after the imposed quadrupolar perturbation is removed, the warp persists
for a few Gyrs, by which time another infall event can be expected.",2006-04-25T20:01:08Z
"Transverse and longitudinal correlation functions in the Intergalactic
  Medium from 32 close pairs of high-redshift quasars","We present the transverse flux correlation function of the Lyman-alpha forest
in quasar absorption spectra at z~2.1 from VLT-FORS and VLT-UVES observations
of a total of 32 pairs of quasars; 26 pairs with separations in the range
0.6<theta<4 arcmin and 6 pairs with 4<theta<10 arcmin. Correlation is detected
at the 3sigma level up to separations of the order of ~4 arcmin (or ~4.4 h^{-1}
Mpc comoving at z=2.1 for Omega_{m}=0.3 and Omega_{Lambda}=0.7). We have,
furthermore, measured the longitudinal correlation function at a somewhat
higher mean redshift (z=2.39) from 20 lines of sight observed with high
spectral resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio with VLT-UVES. We compare
the observed transverse and longitudinal correlation functions to that obtained
from numerical simulations and illustrate the effect of spectral resolution,
thermal broadening and peculiar motions. The shape and correlation length of
the correlation functions are in good agreement with those expected from
absorption by the filamentary and sheet-like structures in the photoionized
warm intergalactic medium predicted in CDM-like models for structures
formation. Using a sample of 139 C_{iv} systems detected along the lines of
sight toward the pairs of quasars we also investigate the transverse
correlation of metals on the same scales. The observed transverse correlation
function of intervening C_{iv} absorption systems is consistent with that of a
randomly distributed population of absorbers. This is likely due to the small
number of pairs with separation less than 2 arcmin. We detect, however, a
significant overdensity of systems in the sightlines towards the quartet
Q0103-294A&B, Q0102-2931 and Q0102-293 which extends over the redshift range
1.5<z<2.2 and an angular scale larger than 10 arcmin.",2006-05-24T09:13:50Z
$^3$He experimentum crucis for Dark Matter puzzles,"The leading direct dark matter search experiments: CDMS, Edelweis and
DAMA/NaI exhibit different results for different approaches to the problem.
This contradiction can reflect a nontrivial and probably a multi-component
nature of the cosmological dark matter. WIMPs can possess dominantly a Spin
Dependent interaction with nucleons. They can be superheavy or represent
atom-like systems of superheavy charged particles. The Dark matter can contain
a component, which strongly interacts with the matter. We show that even a
moderate size superfluid $^3$He detector provides a crucial test for these
hypotheses and that its existing laboratory prototype is already of interest
for the experimental dark matter search.",2006-06-14T17:08:12Z
"First stars X. The nature of three unevolved Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor
  stars","From high-resolution VLT/UVES spectra (R~43,000), we determine abundances or
upper limits for Li, C, N, O, and other important elements, as well as 12C/13C
isotopic ratio for three Carbon enhanced metal poor stars. All three stars have
-3.30 <= [Fe/H] <= -2.85 and moderate to high CNO abundances. CS 22958-042 is
one of the most carbon-rich CEMP stars known ([C/Fe] = +3.2), while CS
29528-041 (one of the few N-enhanced metal-poor stars known) is one of the most
nitrogen rich ([N/Fe] = +3.0). Oxygen is very high in CS 31080-095 ([O/Fe] =
+2.35) and in CS 22958-042 ([O/Fe] = +1.35). All three stars exhibit [Sr/Fe] <
0; Ba is not detected in CS 22958-042 ([Ba/Fe] < -0.53), but it is moderately
enhanced ([Ba/Fe] ~ 1) in the other two stars. CS 22958-042 displays one of the
largest sodium overabundances yet found in CEMP stars ([Na/Fe] = +2.8). CS
22958-042 has 12C/13C = 9, similar to most other CEMP stars without enhanced
neutron-capture elements, while 12C/13C <= 40 in CS 31080-095. CS 31080-095 and
CS 29528-041 have A(Li) ~ 1.7, below the Spite Plateau, while Li is not
detected in CS 22958-042. CS 22958-042 is a CEMP-no star, but the other two
stars are in no known class of CEMP star and thus either constitute a new class
or are a link between the CEMP-no and CEMP-s classes, adding complexity to the
abundance patterns for CEMP stars. We interpret the abundance patterns in our
stars to imply that current models for the presumed AGB binary progenitors lack
an extra-mixing process, similar to those apparently operating in RGB stars.",2006-08-04T13:59:32Z
KM3NeT: Towards a km3 Mediterranean Neutrino Telescope,"The observation of high-energy extraterrestrial neutrinos is one of the most
promising future options to increase our knowledge on non-thermal processes in
the universe. Neutrinos are e.g. unavoidably produced in environments where
high-energy hadrons collide; in particular this almost certainly must be true
in the astrophysical accelerators of cosmic rays, which thus could be
identified unambiguously by sky observations in ""neutrino light"". To establish
neutrino astronomy beyond the detection of single events, neutrino telescopes
of km3 scale are needed. In order to obtain full sky coverage, a corresponding
detector in the Mediterranean Sea is required to complement the IceCube
experiment currently under construction at the South Pole. The groups pursuing
the current neutrino telescope projects in the Mediterranean Sea, ANTARES, NEMO
and NESTOR, have joined to prepare this future installation in a 3-year,
EU-funded Design Study named KM3NeT. This report will highlight some of the
physics issues to be addressed with the KM3NeT detector and will outline the
path towards its realisation, with a focus on the upcoming Design Study.",2006-06-03T14:08:48Z
"The Real-Time Evolution of Sakurai's Star (V4334 Sgr) and other (V)LTP
  Objects","We report on the progress of our on-going campaign to monitor the evolution
of the VLTP objects V4334 Sgr and V605 Aql, as well as the suspected (V)LTP
object CK Vul. V4334 Sgr does not show signs of increased ionization compared
to our previous observations in 2004. We obtained the first radio detection of
V605 Aql, indicating a strong increase in radio flux since 1987. We also
present the first radio detection of CK Vul and discuss the expansion of the

Spectral ageing analysis of the double-double radio galaxy J1453+3308,"We present new radio observations at frequencies ranging from 240 to 4860 MHz
of the well-known, double-double radio galaxy (DDRG), J1453+3308, using both
the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and the Very Large Array (VLA).
These observations enable us to determine the spectra of the inner and outer
lobes over a large frequency range and demonstrate that while the spectrum of
the outer lobes exhibits significant curvature, that of the inner lobes appears
practically straight. The break frequency, and hence the inferred synchrotron
age of the outer structure, determined from 16$-$arcsec strips transverse to
the source axis, increases with distance from the heads of the lobes. The
maximum spectral ages for the northern and southern lobes are $\sim$47 and 58
Myr respectively. Because of the difference in the lengths of the lobes these
ages imply a mean separation velocity of the heads of the lobes from the
emitting plasma of 0.036c for both the northern and southern lobes. The
synchrotron age of the inner double is about 2 Myr which implies an advance
velocity of $\sim$0.1c, but these values have large uncertainties because the
spectrum is practically straight.",2006-07-31T18:01:12Z
"The UV spectrum of HS1700+6416 I. Predicting the metal line content of
  the far UV spectrum","In preparation of a study of the HeII/HI ratio towards the bright QSO
HS1700+6416, we predict the metal line content of the far-UV spectral range by
modelling 18 metal absorption line systems with redshifts 0.2<z<2.6 identified
in the spectrum of this quasar. For that purpose, we investigate the spectral
energy distribution of the metagalactic ionizing radiation field. Simple
photoionization models based on 8 different shapes of the ionizing background
are tested for each system. The adopted energy distributions comprise the
Haardt & Madau (2001, HM) model of metagalactic UV background as well as
typical spectra of AGN and starburst galaxies. The models are evaluated and the
favoured one is estimated. We find that the majority of the considered systems
is best reproduced with a HM-like ionizing radiation, where the HeII break,
formally located at 4 Ryd, is shifted to lower energies (~3 Ryd), probably due
to the opacity of the higher HeII Lyman series lines. The remaining systems can
be reasonably described with models based on the unmodified HM background or
the spectra of AGN or starburst galaxies. This finding supports the idea that
the UV background is spatially variable due to both IGM opacity variations and
to local sources. In comparison to an unmodified HM background, the resulting
ionizing spectrum leads to carbon abundances lower by ~0.5 dex. Furthermore, if
the ionizing radiation field as determined from metal line systems was typical
for the IGM, the expected HeII/HI ratio would be 150 to 190.",2006-05-17T16:16:26Z
"Velocity-Metallicity Correlation for high-z DLA Galaxies: Evidence for a
  Mass-Metallicity Relation?","We used our database of VLT-UVES quasar spectra to build up a sample of 70
Damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) or strong sub-DLA systems with total neutral hydrogen
column densities of log N(HI)>20 and redshifts in the range 1.7<z_abs<4.3. For
each of the systems, we measured in an homogeneous manner the metallicities
relative to Solar, [X/H] (with X=Zn, or S or Si), and the velocity widths of
low-ionization line profiles, Delta V. We provide for the first time evidence
for a correlation between DLA metallicity and line profile velocity width,
which is detected at the 6.1sigma significance level. This confirms the trend
previously observed in a much smaller sample by Wolfe & Prochaska (1998). The
best-fit linear relation is [X/H]=1.55(\pm 0.12) log Delta V -4.33(\pm 0.23)
with Delta V expressed in km/s. The slope of the DLA velocity-metallicity
relation is the same within uncertainties between the higher (z_abs>2.43) and
the lower (z_abs<2.43) redshift halves of our sample. However, the two
populations of systems are statistically different. There is a strong redshift
evolution in the sense that the mean metallicity and mean velocity width
increase with decreasing redshift. We argue that the existence of a DLA
velocity-metallicity correlation, over more than a factor of 100 spread in
metallicity, is probably the consequence of an underlying mass-metallicity
relation for the galaxies responsible for DLA absorption lines. Assuming a
simple linear scaling of the galaxy luminosity with the mass of the dark-matter
halo, we find that the slope of the DLA velocity-metallicity relation is
consistent with that of the luminosity-metallicity relation derived for local
galaxies. [...] abridged.",2006-06-08T05:22:54Z
Models of mass segregation at the Galactic centre,"We study the process of mass segregation through 2-body relaxation in
galactic nuclei with a central massive black hole (MBH). This study has bearing
on a variety of astrophysical questions, from the distribution of X-ray
binaries at the Galactic centre, to tidal disruptions of main-sequence and
giant stars, to inspirals of compact objects into the MBH, an important
category of events for the future space borne gravitational wave interferometer
LISA. In relatively small galactic nuclei, typical hosts of MBHs with masses in
the range 1e4-1e7 Msun, the relaxation induces the formation of a steep density
cusp around the MBH and strong mass segregation. Using a spherical stellar
dynamical Monte-Carlo code, we simulate the long-term relaxational evolution of
galactic nucleus models with a spectrum of stellar masses. Our focus is the
concentration of stellar black holes to the immediate vicinity of the MBH.
Special attention is given to models developed to match the conditions in the
Milky Way nucleus.",2006-06-30T20:24:28Z
"Searching for a gigamaser in APM08279+5255, and other short stories","Bolometer arrays on large antennas at high, dry sites have unveiled a dusty
population of massive, luminous galaxies - submillimetre galaxies, or SMGs -
which make a significant contribution to the star-formation rate density at z >
1. The most crucial piece of information required to derive the history of
obscured star formation is the redshift distribution of this galaxy population,
N(z), which breaks degeneracies in the models and allows the mass and dynamics
of the galaxies to be explored via high-resolution three-dimensional imaging in
CO and by determining their level of clustering. Many SMGs are extremely faint,
optically; some have no plausible counterparts, even in the IR, making the
determination of an unbiased N(z) very difficult. The arrival of Herschel and
next-generation ground-based submm cameras will likely exacerbate this
so-called `redshift deadlock'. Here, we report the first test of a new method
for determining redshifts, based on the observed dependence of maser and IR
luminosities. We have searched the dusty, lensed, hyperluminous quasar,
APM08279+5255, for the 1612-, 1665- and 1667-MHz hydroxyl lines as well as the
22-GHz water line. At z = 3.9 these are shifted to 329, 340 and 4,538MHz. Our
relatively shallow test data reveal no convincing maser activity but we set a
meaningful constraint on the OH maser luminosity and we approach the expected
thermal noise levels, meaning progress is possible. As an aside, we present
deep new submm and radio imaging of this field. Using a simple shift-and-add
technique we uncover a new submm galaxy, conceivably at the redshift of
APM08279+5255.",2006-03-28T11:32:49Z
"Radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray Emission Models of the Colliding Winds
  Binary WR 140","We use hydrodynamical models of the wind-collision region (WCR) in the
archetype colliding-wind system WR140 to determine the spatial and spectral
distribution of the radio, X-ray and gamma-ray emission from shock accelerated
electrons. Our calculations are for orbital phase 0.837 when the observed radio
emission is close to maximum. Using the observed thermal X-ray emission
together with the radio emission to constrain the mass-loss rates, we find that
the O-star mass-loss rate is consistent with recent reductions for O4-5
supergiants. We demonstrate that radio VLBI observations of the WCR fail to
constrain the opening angle. The observed low frequency turnover at ~3 GHz in
the radio emission is due to free-free absorption, since models based on the
Razin effect have an unacceptably large fraction of energy in non-thermal
particles. The index of the non-thermal electron energy distribution is flatter
than the canonical value for diffusive shock acceleration, namely p<2. Several
mechanisms are discussed that could lead to such an index. Tighter constraints
on p and the nature of the shocks in WR140 will be obtained from future
observations at MeV and GeV energies, for which we generally predict lower
fluxes than previous work. Since the high stellar photon fluxes prevent the
acceleration of electrons beyond gamma > 1e5-1e6, TeV emission from CWB systems
will provide unambiguous evidence of pion-decay emission from accelerated ions.
We finish by commenting on the emission and physics of the multiple wind
collisions in dense stellar clusters, paying particular attention to the
Galactic Centre (abridged).",2006-03-29T10:52:50Z
Models of inflation with primordial non-Gaussianities,"We present a class of models in which the primordial metric fluctuations do
not necessarily obey Gaussian statistics. These models are realizations of
mechanisms in which non-Gaussianity is first generated by a light scalar field
and then transferred into curvature fluctuations during or at the end of
inflation. For this class of models we present generic results for the
probability distribution functions of the metric perturbation at the end of
inflation. It is stressed that finite volume effects can induce non trivial
effects that we sketch.",2006-04-10T12:57:21Z
A fossil galaxy cluster; an X-ray and optical study of RX J1416.4+2315,"We present a detailed X-ray and optical study of a distant fossil system RX
J1416.4+2315 (z=0.13), combining Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, optical
photometry and spectroscopy. X-ray emitting hot gas imaged by both the Chandra
and XMM-Newton shows a globally relaxed spatial distribution, supporting the
idea that fossil groups are old galaxy systems with no recent mergers. However,
the diffuse X-ray emission shows signs of asymmetries in the core of the
system. With a mean gas temperature of ~ 4.0 keV and total gravitational mass
of 3.1 x 10^14 solar mass, within the virial radius, this is better described
as a fossil galaxy cluster rather than a fossil group. The temperature profile
shows no sign of a significant cooler core despite a cooling time dropping to 5
Gyr within the resolved core. We find a mass concentration parameter c_200 ~ 11
which is relatively high for a cluster of this mass, indicative of an early
formation epoch. Using the spectroscopically identified cluster members we
present the galaxy luminosity function for this fossil system. We measure the
velocity dispersion of the galaxies to be ~ 700 km/s based on 18 confirmed
members. The dynamical mass is nearly twice the total gravitational mass
derived from the X-ray analysis. The measured R-band mass-to-light ratio,
within the virial radius, is ~ 440 M/L (solar) which is not unusual for
clusters of galaxies. The central giant elliptical galaxy has discy isophotes
and spectral features typical of elliptical galaxies.",2006-03-22T15:08:03Z
"GRB 050717: A Long, Short-Lag, High Peak Energy Burst Observed by Swift
  and Konus","The long burst GRB 050717 was observed simultaneously by the Burst Alert
Telescope (BAT) on Swift and the Konus instrument on Wind. Significant hard to
soft spectral evolution was seen. Early gamma-ray and X-ray emission was
detected by both BAT and the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) on Swift. The XRT continued
to observe the burst for 7.1 days and detect it for 1.4 days. The X-ray light
curve showed a classic decay pattern; the afterglow was too faint for a jet
break to be detected. No optical, infrared or ultraviolet counterpart was
discovered despite deep searches within 14 hours of the burst. Two particular
features of the prompt emission make GRB 050717 a very unusual burst. First,
the peak of the nu Fnu spectrum was observed to be 2401(-568/+781) keV for the
main peak, which is the highest value of Epeak ever observed. Secondly, the
spectral lag for GRB 050717 was determined to be 2.5 +- 2.6 ms, consistent with
zero and unusually short for a long burst. This lag measurement suggests that
this burst has a high intrinsic luminosity and hence is at high redshift (z >
2.7). Despite these unusual features GRB 050717 exhibits the classic prompt and
afterglow behaviour of a gamma-ray burst.",2006-05-19T18:15:38Z
"Envelope Expansion with Core Collapse. III. Similarity Isothermal Shocks
  in a Magnetofluid","We explore MHD solutions for envelope expansions with core collapse (EECC)
with isothermal MHD shocks in a quasi-spherical symmetry and outline potential
astrophysical applications of such magnetized shock flows. MHD shock solutions
are classified into three classes according to the downstream characteristics
near the core. Class I solutions are those characterized by free-fall collapses
towards the core downstream of an MHD shock, while Class II solutions are those
characterized by Larson-Penston (LP) type near the core downstream of an MHD
shock. Class III solutions are novel, sharing both features of Class I and II
solutions with the presence of a sufficiently strong magnetic field as a
prerequisite. Various MHD processes may occur within the regime of these
isothermal MHD shock similarity solutions, such as sub-magnetosonic
oscillations, free-fall core collapses, radial contractions and expansions. We
can also construct families of twin MHD shock solutions as well as an
`isothermal MHD shock' separating two magnetofluid regions of two different yet
constant temperatures. The versatile behaviours of such MHD shock solutions may
be utilized to model a wide range of astrophysical problems, including star
formation in magnetized molecular clouds, MHD link between the asymptotic giant
branch phase to the proto-planetary nebula phase with a hot central magnetized
white dwarf, relativistic MHD pulsar winds in supernova remnants, radio
afterglows of soft gamma-ray repeaters and so forth.",2006-04-12T08:11:11Z
"Low T/|W| dynamical instabilities in differentially rotating stars:
  Diagnosis with canonical angular momentum","We study the nature of non-axisymmetric dynamical instabilities in
differentially rotating stars with both linear eigenmode analysis and
hydrodynamic simulations in Newtonian gravity. We especially investigate the
following three types of instability; the one-armed spiral instability, the low
T/|W| bar instability, and the high T/|W| bar instability, where T is the
rotational kinetic energy and W is the gravitational potential energy. The
nature of the dynamical instabilities is clarified by using a canonical angular
momentum as a diagnostic. We find that the one-armed spiral and the low T/|W|
bar instabilities occur around the corotation radius, and they grow through the
inflow of canonical angular momentum around the corotation radius. The result
is a clear contrast to that of a classical dynamical bar instability in high
T/|W|. We also discuss the feature of gravitational waves generated from these
three types of instability.",2006-04-06T20:00:29Z
Mechanical Model for Relativistic Blast Waves,"Relativistic blast waves can be described by a mechanical model. In this
model, the ""blast"" -- the compressed gas between the forward and reverse shocks
-- is viewed as one hot body. Equations governing its dynamics are derived from
conservation of mass, energy, and momentum. Simple analytical solutions are
obtained in the two limiting cases of ultra-relativistic and non-relativistic
reverse shock. Equations are derived for the general explosion problem.",2006-07-28T12:25:48Z
"Three Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations:
  Polarization Analysis","The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe WMAP has mapped the entire sky in
five frequency bands between 23 and 94 GHz with polarization sensitive
radiometers. We present three-year full-sky maps of the polarization and
analyze them for foreground emission and cosmological implications. These
observations open up a new window for understanding the universe. WMAP observes
significant levels of polarized foreground emission due to both Galactic
synchrotron radiation and thermal dust emission. The least contaminated channel
is at 61 GHz. Informed by a model of the Galactic foreground emission, we
subtract the foreground emission from the maps. In the foreground corrected
maps, for l=2-6, we detect l(l+1) C_l^{EE} / (2 pi) = 0.086 +-0.029
microkelvin^2. This is interpreted as the result of rescattering of the CMB by
free electrons released during reionization and corresponds to an optical depth
of tau = 0.10 +- 0.03. We see no evidence for B-modes, limiting them to l(l+1)
C_l^{BB} / (2 pi) = -0.04 +- 0.03 microkelvin^2. We find that the limit from
the polarization signals alone is r<2.2 (95% CL) corresponding to a limit on
the cosmic density of gravitational waves of Omega_{GW}h^2 < 5 times 10^{-12}.
  From the full WMAP analysis, we find r<0.55 (95% CL) corresponding to a limit
of Omega_{GW}h^2 < 10^{-12} (95% CL).",2006-03-17T19:34:46Z
Making sky maps from Planck data,"We compare the performance of multiple codes written by different groups for
making polarized maps from Planck-sized, all-sky cosmic microwave background
(CMB) data. Three of the codes are based on a destriping algorithm; the other
three are implementations of an optimal maximum-likelihood algorithm.
Time-ordered data (TOD) were simulated using the Planck Level-S simulation
pipeline. Several cases of temperature-only data were run to test that the
codes could handle large datasets, and to explore effects such as the precision
of the pointing data. Based on these preliminary results, TOD were generated
for a set of four 217 GHz detectors (the minimum number required to produce I,
Q, and U maps) under two different scanning strategies, with and without noise.
Following correction of various problems revealed by the early simulation, all
codes were able to handle the large data volume that Planck will produce.
Differences in maps produced are small but noticeable; differences in computing
resources are large.",2006-06-14T17:11:57Z
Chandra Observations of Red Sloan Digital Sky Survey Quasars,"We present short \chandra observations of twelve bright (i<18) z_em~1.5
quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey chosen to have significantly redder
optical colors than most quasars at the same redshift. Of the five quasars with
optical properties most consistent with dust reddening at the quasar redshift,
four show indirect evidence of moderate X-ray absorption (inferred N_H~10^22
cm^-2) with a dust-to-gas ratio <1% of the SMC value. The remaining seven
objects show no evidence for even moderate intrinsic X-ray absorption. Thus,
while optically red quasars are marginally more likely to show signatures of
X-ray absorption than optically selected quasars with normal colors,
dust-reddened type 1 AGN (as opposed to fully obscured type 2 AGN) are unlikely
to contribute significantly to the remaining unresolved hard X-ray background.
The red quasar population includes objects with intrinsically red continua as
well as objects with dust-reddened continua. Improved sample selection is thus
needed to increase our understanding of either subpopulation. To identify
dust-reddened quasars likely to exhibit X-ray absorption, some measure of
spectral curvature is preferable to simple cuts in observed or relative
broad-band colors.",2006-06-16T21:17:22Z
"Discovery of the new slowly pulsating B star HD 163830 (B5II/III) from
  MOST spacebased photometry","We report the discovery of a new slowly pulsating B (SPB) star, with the
largest number of detected frequencies to date by more than a factor of three,
based on 37 days of MOST (Microvariability & Oscillations of STars) satellite
guide star photometry. The star HD 163830 (V = 9.3, B5II/III) varies in twenty
detected frequencies in the range $0.035 - 1.06$ d$^{-1}$ ($0.4 - 12.3 ~
\mu$Hz) with amplitudes from 0.7 to 7.6 mmag ($S/N$ from {4 to 43}). Eighteen
of these frequencies are consistent with low-degree, high-order nonradial
g-modes {of seismic models of an evolved 4.5$M_{\odot}$ star. We are unable to
identify one unique model due to lack of mode identifications. The lowest two
frequencies may be associated with the rotation of HD 163830, but firm proof of
this must await future spectroscopic data.",2006-04-03T19:54:32Z
"Young Massive Clusters - Formation Efficiencies and (Initial) Mass
  Functions","Globular clusters are often assumed to be good tracers of major star
formation episodes in their host galaxies. While observations over the past 2
decades have confirmed the presence of young objects with globular cluster-like
properties in many galaxies, it is still not well understood exactly how the
formation efficiency of bound star clusters relative to field stars and their
mass spectrum depend on external factors. The cluster initial mass function
typically appears to be consistent with a power-law with a slope of about -2,
but most attempts to constrain any upper limit on the CIMF have been limited by
size-of-sample effects. However, evidence is starting to accumulate for
possible truncation of the cluster mass function. It is tentatively suggested
that the upper mass limit may currently be at about 10^5 Msun in the Milky Way
disk, while there are indications that it is about 5x10^5 Msun in M51 and about
2x10^6 Msun in the Antennae. Some extreme starbursts (e.g. Arp 220, NGC 7252)
are (or were) able to form clusters as massive as 10^7 Msun. The overall
formation efficiency of star clusters (relative to field stars) in the Galactic
bulge may not have been much different from that in the disk today, but was
probably significantly higher for metal-poor GCs in halos.",2006-06-26T14:40:50Z
Width of the 511 KeV Line from the Bulge of the Galaxy,"In this paper I present the detail estimations for the width of the 511 keV
line produced by a mechanism when dark matter is represented by macroscopically
large dense nuggets. I argue that the width of 511 keV emission in this
mechanism is very narrow (in a few keV range) in agreement with all
observations. The dominant mechanism of the annihilation in this case is the
positronium formation e^+e^-to ^1S_0 to 2\gamma rather than a direct e^+e^- to
2\gamma$ annihilation. I also discuss some generic features of the \gamma rays
spectrum (in few MeV range) resulting from this mechanism.",2006-07-17T17:30:48Z
The Nature of SS433 and the Ultraluminous X-ray Sources,"The periodic precession (162--day) and nodding (6.3--day) motions of the jets
in SS433 are driven in the outer regions of the disc, whereas the jets
themselves, being relativistic, are launched near the black hole at the disc
centre. Given that the nutation period is comparable to the dynamical timescale
in the outer regions of the disc, it seems unlikely that these periods can be
communicated efficiently to the disc centre. Here we propose that the massive
outflow observed in SS433 is launched at large radii in the disc, about 1/10 of
the outer disc edge, and that it is this outflow which responds to the
oscillations of the outer disc and determines the direction of the jets. The
massive outflow is launched at large radius because the mass transfer rate is
hyper-Eddington. This implies not only that the total luminosity of SS433
exceeds $\le$ by a considerable factor, but also that the radiative output is
collimated along the outflow. We thus suggest that SS433 is an ultraluminous
X-ray source (ULX) viewed `from the side'. We also suggest that the obscured
{\it INTEGRAL} sources may be SS433--like objects, but with slightly lower mass
transfer rates.",2006-04-24T17:58:35Z
A Search for Radio Emission from Type Ia Supernovae,"We present and discuss the radio observations of 27 Type Ia supernovae (SNe
Ia) observed over two decades with the Very Large Array. No SN Ia has been
detected so far in the radio, implying a very low density for any possible
circumstellar material established by the progenitor, or progenitor system,
before explosion. We derive 2-sigma upper limits to a steady mass-loss rate for
individual SN systems as low as ~3 X 10^{-8} Msun yr^{-1}, discriminating
strongly against white dwarf accretion via a stellar wind from a massive binary
companion in the symbiotic star, an example of the ``single degenerate''
scenario. However, a white dwarf accreting from a relatively low mass companion
via a sufficiently high efficiency (>60-80%), Roche lobe overflow is still
consistent with our limits. The ``double degenerate'' merger scenario also
cannot be excluded.",2006-03-30T00:56:29Z
The First Stars in The Universe,"Large telescopes have allowed astronomers to observe galaxies that formed as
early as 850 million years after the Big Bang. We predict when the first star
that astronomers can observe formed in the universe, accounting for the first
time for the size of the universe and for three essential ingredients: the
light travel time from distant galaxies, Poisson and density fluctuations on
all scales, and the effect of very early cosmic history on galaxy formation. We
find that the first observable star is most likely to have formed 30 million
years after the Big Bang (at redshift 65), much earlier than previously
expected. Also, the first galaxy as massive as our own Milky Way likely formed
when the universe was only 400 Myr old (at redshift 11). We also show that
significant modifications are required in current methods of numerically
simulating the formation of galaxies at redshift 20 and above.",2006-04-04T10:42:03Z
Production mechanisms of multiple primaries for Cosmic Rays Showers,"We investigate the physical mechanism of the GZ-effect that could explain the
production of multiple primaries from an event initiated outside the Earth's
atmosphere. In this case, there would correspondingly be multiple extensive air
showers in temporal coincidence at ground, even for detectors separated by many
kilometers, and also showers initiated by primaries of different energies could
consequently have a common source. We analyse the perspectives and limits of
some models and discuss the experimental counterparts.",2006-07-04T09:01:31Z
"Submillimeter spectroscopy of southern hot cores: NGC6334(I) and

hot and dense gas close to the central object(s). The physics and chemistry of
the inner cores of two high mass star forming regions, NGC6334(I) and

physical parameters were determined through fitting of the spectra. Both
sources show similar spectra that are comparable to that of the only other high

with an even higher line density. Evidence for very compact, very hot sources

germanium detectors maintained at 85 K by a cryogenic system, located inside an
active BGO veto shield, it achieves excellent spectral resolution of about 2
keV for 1 MeV photons, which permits astrophysical gamma-ray line studies with
good narrow-line sensitivity. In this paper we review some goals of gamma-ray
astronomy from space and present the INTEGRAL satellite, in particular its
instruments ISGRI and SPI. Ground and in-flight calibration results from SPI
are presented, before presenting some selected astrophysical results from
INTEGRAL. In particular results on point source searches are presented,
followed by results on nuclear astrophysics, exemplified by the study of the
1809 keV gamma-ray line from radioactive 26Al nuclei produced by the ongoing
stellar nucleosynthesis in the Galaxy. Finally a review on the study of the
positron-electron annihilation in the Galactic center region, producing 511 keV
gamma-rays, is presented.",2006-06-22T09:37:53Z
"Solar Carbon Monoxide, Thermal Profiling, and the Abundances of C, O,
  and their Isotopes","A solar photospheric ""thermal profiling"" analysis is presented, exploiting
the infrared rovibrational bands of carbon monoxide (CO) as observed with the
McMath-Pierce Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) at Kitt Peak, and from above
the Earth's atmosphere by the Shuttle-borne ATMOS experiment. Visible continuum
intensities and center-limb behavior constrained the temperature profile of the
deep photosphere, while CO center-limb behavior defined the thermal structure
at higher altitudes. The oxygen abundance was self consistently determined from
weak CO absorptions. Our analysis was meant to complement recent studies based
on 3-D convection models which, among other things, have revised the historical
solar oxygen (and carbon) abundance downward by a factor of nearly two;
although in fact our conclusions do not support such a revision. Based on
various considerations, an oxygen abundance of 700+/-100 ppm (parts per million
relative to hydrogen) is recommended; the large uncertainty reflects the model
sensitivity of CO. New solar isotopic ratios also are reported for 13C, 17O,
and 18O.",2006-06-07T15:01:44Z
"Young Massive Clusters - Formation Efficiencies and (Initial) Mass
  Functions","Globular clusters are often assumed to be good tracers of major star
formation episodes in their host galaxies. While observations over the past 2
decades have confirmed the presence of young objects with globular cluster-like
properties in many galaxies, it is still not well understood exactly how the
formation efficiency of bound star clusters relative to field stars and their
mass spectrum depend on external factors. The cluster initial mass function
typically appears to be consistent with a power-law with a slope of about -2,
but most attempts to constrain any upper limit on the CIMF have been limited by
size-of-sample effects. However, evidence is starting to accumulate for
possible truncation of the cluster mass function. It is tentatively suggested
that the upper mass limit may currently be at about 10^5 Msun in the Milky Way
disk, while there are indications that it is about 5x10^5 Msun in M51 and about
2x10^6 Msun in the Antennae. Some extreme starbursts (e.g. Arp 220, NGC 7252)
are (or were) able to form clusters as massive as 10^7 Msun. The overall
formation efficiency of star clusters (relative to field stars) in the Galactic
bulge may not have been much different from that in the disk today, but was
probably significantly higher for metal-poor GCs in halos.",2006-06-26T14:40:50Z
Saving Planetary Systems: Dead Zones & Planetary Migration,"The tidal interaction between a disk and a planet leads to the planet's
migration. A long-standing question regarding this mechanism is how to stop the
migration before planets plunge into their central stars. In this paper, we
propose a new, simple mechanism to significantly slow down planet migration,
and test the possibility by using a hybrid numerical integrator to simulate the
disk-planet interaction. The key component of the scenario is the role of low
viscosity regions in protostellar disks known as dead zones, which affect
planetary migration in two ways. First of all, it allows a smaller-mass planet
to open a gap, and hence switch the faster type I migration to the slower type
II migration. Secondly, a low viscosity slows down type II migration itself,
because type II migration is directly proportional to the viscosity. We present
numerical simulations of planetary migration by using a hybrid symplectic
integrator-gas dynamics code. Assuming that the disk viscosity parameter inside
the dead zone is (alpha=1e-4-1e-5), we find that, when a low-mass planet (e.g.
1-10 Earth masses) migrates from outside the dead zone, its migration is
stopped due to the mass accumulation inside the dead zone. When a low-mass
planet migrates from inside the dead zone, it opens a gap and slows down its
migration. A massive planet like Jupiter, on the other hand, opens a gap and
slows down inside the dead zone, independent of its initial orbital radius. The
final orbital radius of a Jupiter mass planet depends on the dead zone's
viscosity. For the range of alpha's noted above, this can vary anywhere from 7
AU, to an orbital radius of 0.1 AU that is characteristic of the hot Jupiters.",2006-06-09T16:11:57Z
TIRAVEL - Template Independent RAdial VELocity measurement,"We propose a new approach to measure differential radial velocities, mainly
for single-lined spectroscopic binaries. The proposed procedure - TIRAVEL
(Template Independent RAdial VELocities) - does not rely on a prior theoretical
or observed template, but instead looks for a set of relative Doppler shifts
that simultaneously optimizes the alignment of all the observed spectra. We
suggest a simple measure to quantify this overall alignment and use its maximum
to measure the relative radial velocities. As a demonstration, we apply TIRAVEL
to the observed spectra of three known spectroscopic binaries, and show that in
two cases TIRAVEL performs as good as the commonly used approach, while in one
case TIRAVEL yielded a better orbital solution.",2006-07-13T11:47:06Z
"XMM-Newton observations of the supernova remnant IC443: I. soft X-ray
  emission from shocked interstellar medium","The shocked interstellar medium around IC443 produces strong X-ray emission
in the soft energy band (E<1.5 keV). We present an analysis of such emission as
observed with the EPIC MOS cameras on board the XMM-Newotn observatory, with
the purpose to find clear signatures of the interactions with the interstellar
medium (ISM) in the X-ray band, which may complement results obtained in other
wavelenghts. We found that the giant molecular cloud mapped in CO emission is
located in the foreground and gives an evident signature in the absorption of
X-rays. This cloud may have a torus shape and the part of torus interacting
with the IC443 shock gives rise to 2MASS-K emission in the southeast. The
measured density of emitting X-ray shocked plasma increases toward the
northeastern limb, where the remnant is interacting with an atomic cloud. We
found an excellent correlation between emission in the 0.3-0.5 keV band and
bright optical/radio filament on large spatial scales. The partial shell
structure seen in this band therefore traces the encounter with the atomic
cloud.",2006-06-13T13:15:33Z
"Determining Distances to Clusters of Galaxies using Resonant X-ray
  Emission Lines","Bright clusters of galaxies can be seen out to cosmological distances, and
thus they can be used to derive cosmological parameters. Although the continuum
X-ray emission from the intra-cluster gas is optically thin, the optical depth
of resonant lines of ions of heavy elements can be larger than unity. In this
Letter we study the feasibility of deriving distances to clusters of galaxies
by determining the spatial distribution of the intra-cluster gas from X-ray
imaging and the optical depth from resonant emission lines (the XREL method).
We solve the radiative transfer problem for line scattering in the hot
intra-cluster gas using Monte Carlo simulations. We discuss the spatial and
spectral resolutions needed to use the XREL method for accurate determination
of distances, and hence cosmological parameters, and show that accurate
distances will be obtained by applying this technique with the next generation
of high resolution X-ray spectrometers.",2006-04-25T18:36:07Z
New Analytical Formula for Supercritical Accretion Flows,"We examine a new family of global analytic solutions for optically thick
accretion disks, which includes the supercritical accretion regime. We found
that the ratio of the advection cooling rate, $Q_{\rm adv}$, to the viscous
heating rate, $Q_{\rm vis}$, i.e., $f=Q_{\rm adv}/Q_{\rm vis}$, can be
represented by an analytical form dependent on the radius and the mass
accretion rate. The new analytic solutions can be characterized by the
photon-trapping radius, $\rtrap$, inside which the accretion time is less than
the photon diffusion time in the vertical direction; the nature of the
solutions changes significantly as this radius is crossed. Inside the trapping
radius,
  $f$ approaches $f \propto r^0$, which corresponds to the advection-dominated
limit ($f \sim 1$), whereas outside the trapping radius, the radial dependence
of $f$ changes to $f \propto r^{-2}$, which corresponds to the
radiative-cooling-dominated limit. The analytical formula for $f$ derived here
smoothly connects these two regimes. The set of new analytic solutions
reproduces well the global disk structure obtained by numerical integration
over a wide range of mass accretion rates, including the supercritical
accretion regime. In particular, the effective temperature profiles for our new
solutions are in good agreement with those obtained from numerical solutions.
Therefore, the new solutions will provide a useful tool not only for evaluating
the observational properties of accretion flows, but also for investigating the
mass evolution of black holes in the presence of supercritical accretion flows.",2006-05-10T03:16:40Z
The distribution of ND2H in LDN1689N,"Finding tracers of the innermost regions of prestellar cores is important for
understanding their chemical and dynamical evolution before the onset of
gravitational collapse. While classical molecular tracers, such as CO and CS,
have been shown to be strongly depleted in cold, dense gas by condensation on
grain mantles, it has been a subject of discussion to what extent
nitrogen-bearing species, such as ammonia, are affected by this process. As
deuterium fractionation is efficient in cold, dense gas, deuterated species are
excellent tracers of prestellar cores. A comparison of the spatial distribution
of neutral and ionized deuterated species with the dust continuum emission can
thus provide important insights into the physical and chemical structure of
such regions. We study the spatial distribution of the ground-state 335.5 GHz
line of ND2H in LDN1689N, using APEX, and compare it with the distribution of
the DCO+(3--2) line, as well as the 350 micron dust continuum emission observed
with the SHARC~II bolometer camera at CSO. While the distribution of the ND2H
emission in LDN1689N is generally similar to that of the 350 microns dust
continuum emission, the peak of the ND2H emission is offset by ~10'' to the
East from the dust continuum and DCO+ emission peak. ND2H and ND3 share the
same spatial distribution. The observed offset between the ND2H and DCO+
emission is consistent with the hypothesis that the deuterium peak in LDN1689N
is an interaction region between the outflow shock from IRAS16293--2422 and the
dense ambient gas. We detect the J = 4 - 3 line of H13CO+ at 346.998 GHz in the
image side band serendipitously. This line shows the same spatial distribution
as DCO+(3--2), and peaks close to the 350 mic emission maximum which provides
further support for the shock interaction scenario.",2006-06-07T19:01:27Z
"Hubble Space Telescope Near-Infrared Snapshot Survey of 3CR radio source
  counterparts at low redshift","We present newly acquired images of the near-infrared counterpart of 3CR
radio sources. All the sources were selected to have a redshift of less than
0.3 to allow us to obtain the highest spatial resolution. The observations were
carried out as a snapshot program using the Near-Infrared Camera and
Multiobject Spectrograph (NICMOS) on-board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). In
this paper we describe 69 radio galaxies observed for the first time with
NICMOS during HST cycle 13. All the objects presented here are elliptical
galaxies. However, each of them has unique characteristics such as close
companions, dust lanes, unresolved nuclei, arc-like features, globular clusters
and jets clearly visible from the images or with basic galaxy subtraction.",2006-03-09T16:37:06Z
"Detection of additional Wolf-Rayet stars in the starburst cluster
  Westerlund 1 with SOAR","We report the detection of 3 additional Wolf-Rayet stars in the young cluster
Westerlund 1. They were selected as emission-line star candidates based on 1
micron narrow-band imaging of the cluster carried out at OPD/LNA (Brazil), and
then confirmed as Wolf-Rayet stars by K-band spectroscopy performed at the 4.1
m SOAR telescope (Chile). Together with previous works, this increases the
population of Wolf-Rayet stars detected in the cluster to 22 members. Moreover,
it is presented for the first time a K-band spectrum of the luminous blue
variable W243, which apparently implies in a higher temperature than that
derived from optical spectra taken in 2003. The WC9 star WR-F was also
observed, showing clear evidence of dust emission in the K-band.",2006-06-20T21:34:11Z
"Non-Equilibrium Beta Processes in Neutron Stars: A Relationship between
  the Net Reaction Rate and the Total Emissivity of Neutrinos","Several different processes could be changing the density in the core of a
neutron star, leading to a departure from $\beta$ equilibrium, quantified by
the chemical potential difference $\delta\mu\equiv\mu_n-\mu_p-\mu_e$. The
evolution of this quantity is coupled to that of the star's interior
temperature $T$ by two functions that quantify the rate at which
neutrino-emitting reactions proceed: the net reaction rate (difference between
$\beta$ decay and capture rates), $\Gamma_{\rm net}(T,\delta\mu)$, and the
total emissivity (total energy emission rate in the form of neutrinos and
antineutrinos), $\epsilon_{\rm tot}(T,\delta\mu)$. Here, we present a simple
and general relationship between these variables, ${\partial\epsilon_{\rm
tot}/\partial\delta\mu=3\Gamma_{\rm net}}$, and show that it holds even in the
case of superfluid nucleons. This relation may simplify the numerical
calculation of these quantities, including superfluid reduction factors.",2006-06-16T19:39:23Z
"A Spectroscopic Study of the Near-IR [SIII] Lines in a Sample of HII
  Galaxies: chemical abundances","A detailed spectroscopic study, from lambda 3700 A to 1 um, was performed for
a sample of 34 HII galaxies in order to derive fundamental parameters for their
HII regions and ionizing sources, as well as gaseous metal abundances. All the
spectra included the nebular [SIII]9069,9532 A lines, given their importance in
the derivation of the S/H abundance and relevant ionization diagnostics. A
systematic method was followed to correct the near-IR [SIII] line fluxes for
the effects of the atmospheric transmission.A comparative analysis of the
predictions of the empirical abundance indicators R23 and S23 has been
performed. The relative hardness of their ionizing sources was studied using
the eta parameter, and exploring the role played by metallicity. For 22
galaxies of the sample a direct value of te[SIII] was derived, along with their
ionic and total S/H abundances. Their ionic and total O/H abundances were
derived using direct determinations of te[OIII].For the rest of the objects,
the total S/H abundance was derived using S23. The abundance range covered by
our sample goes from 1/20 solar up to solar metallicity. The mean S/O ratio
derived is log (S/O)=-1.68+/-0.20 dex, 1 sigma below the solar S/O value. The
S/O abundance ratio shows no significant trend with O/H over the range of
abundance covered in this work, in agreement with previous findings.There is a
trend for HII galaxies with lower gaseous metallicity to present harder
ionizing spectra. We compared the distribution of the ionic ratios O+/O++ vs.
S+/S++ derived for our sample with the predictions of a grid of photoionization
models performed for different stellar effective temperatures. This analysis
indicates that a large fraction of galaxies in our sample seem to be ionized by
extremely hard spectra.",2006-06-19T17:34:07Z
Why anthropic reasoning cannot predict Lambda,"We revisit anthropic arguments purporting to explain the measured value of
the cosmological constant. We argue that different ways of assigning
probabilities to candidate universes lead to totally different anthropic
predictions. As an explicit example, we show that weighting different universes
by the total number of possible observations leads to an extremely small
probability for observing a value of Lambda equal to or greater than what we
now measure. We conclude that anthropic reasoning within the framework of
probability as frequency is ill-defined and that in the absence of a
fundamental motivation for selecting one weighting scheme over another the
anthropic principle cannot be used to explain the value of Lambda, nor, likely,
any other physical parameters.",2006-07-11T13:31:46Z
"The Extragalactic Lens VLBI Imaging Survey (ELVIS). I. A Search for the
  Central Image in the Gravitational Lens PMN J1838-3427","The Extragalactic Lens VLBI Imaging Survey (ELVIS) searches for central
images of lensed radio quasars, in order to measure the central density
profiles of distant galaxies. Here we present sensitive multi-epoch Very Long
Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of PMN J1838-3427 at 8 GHz, with a 1 sigma
noise level of 38 microJy beam^(-1). Based on the absence of a central image of
the background source at this level, we explore the possibilities for the
central matter distribution in the lens galaxy. A power-law density profile,
rho ~ r^(-gamma), must have gamma > 1.93. Thus the density profile is close to
an isothermal profile (gamma = 2) or steeper. The upper limit on any
constant-density core in an otherwise isothermal profile is ~< 5 parsecs. We
also derive the constraints on models in which the density profile is
isothermal on kiloparsec scales, but is allowed to have a different power law
in the central ~100 parsecs. If the lens galaxy harbors a supermassive black
hole, the galaxy profile is allowed to be shallower, but for the expected black
hole mass the galaxy profile must still be close to isothermal or steeper.",2006-05-06T03:26:57Z
Producing ultra-strong magnetic fields in neutron star mergers,"We report an extremely rapid mechanism for magnetic field amplification
during the merger of a binary neutron star system. This has implications for
the production of the short class of Gamma-Ray Bursts, which recent
observations suggest may originate in such mergers. In detailed
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the merger process, the fields are amplified
via Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities beyond magnetar field strength and may
therefore represent the strongest magnetic fields in the Universe. The
amplification occurs in the shear layer which forms between the neutron stars
and on a time scale of only 1 millisecond, i.e. long before the remnant can
collapse into a black hole.",2006-03-31T08:51:57Z
Natural Downsizing in Hierarchical Galaxy Formation,"Stellar-population analyses of today's galaxies show ""downsizing"", where the
stars in more massive galaxies tend to have formed earlier and over a shorter
time span. We show that this phenomenon is not necessarily ""anti-hierarchical""
but rather has its natural roots in the bottom-up clustering process of
dark-matter haloes. While the main progenitor does indeed show an opposite
effect, the integrated mass in all the progenitors down to a given minimum mass
shows a robust downsizing that is qualitatively similar to what has been
observed. These results are derived analytically from the standard extended
Press Schechter (EPS) theory, and are confirmed by merger trees based on EPS or
drawn from N-body simulations. The downsizing is valid for any minimum mass, as
long as it is the same for all haloes at any given time, but the effect is
weaker for smaller minimum mass. If efficient star formation is triggered by
atomic cooling, then a minimum halo mass arises naturally from the minimum
virial temperature for cooling, T~10^4 K, though for such a small minimum mass
the effect is weaker than observed. Baryonic feedback effects, which are
expected to stretch the duration of star formation in small galaxies and shut
it down in massive haloes at late epochs, are likely to play a subsequent role
in shaping up the final downsizing behaviour. Other appearances of downsizing,
such as the decline with time of the typical mass of star-forming galaxies, may
not be attributed to the gravitational clustering process but rather arise from
the gas processes.",2006-05-01T22:57:25Z
Spitzer 24 micron Survey of Debris Disks in the Pleiades,"We performed a 24 micron 2 Deg X 1 Deg survey of the Pleiades cluster, using
the MIPS instrument on Spitzer. Fifty four members ranging in spectral type
from B8 to K6 show 24 micron fluxes consistent with bare photospheres. All Be
stars show excesses attributed to free-free emission in their gaseous
envelopes. Five early-type stars and four solar-type stars show excesses
indicative of debris disks. We find a debris disk fraction of 25 % for B-A
members and 10 % for F-K3 ones. These fractions appear intermediate between
those for younger clusters and for the older field stars. They indicate a decay
with age of the frequency of the dust-production events inside the planetary
zone, with similar time scales for solar-mass stars as have been found
previously for A-stars.",2006-06-02T00:25:34Z
"Cosmological constraints on a dark energy model with a non-linear scalar
  field","In the present work we study a dark energy model in which a non-linear scalar
field (tachyon) with a Born-Infeld type of action is responsible for the
observed cosmic acceleration. The potential of the tachyon is well-motivated
since it comes from open string theory and the model is subjected to various
cosmological constraints with data coming from supernovae as well as from
microwave background radiation. Our analysis shows that in the particular model
under study the tachyon can be an excellent candidate for dark energy in the
universe, as the model agrees with a series of observational data and for a
wide range of the parameters of the model.",2006-06-11T13:46:24Z
"A search for optical bursts from the rotating radio transient J1819-1458
  with ULTRACAM","We report on the search for optical bursts from J1819-1458, a member of the
recently discovered Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs). J1819-1458 exhibits 3
millisecond bursts with a peak flux at 1.4 GHz of 3.6 Jy every ~3.4 minutes,
implying that it is visible for only ~1 second per day at radio wavelengths.
Assuming that the optical light behaves in a similar manner, the most sensitive
way of detecting RRATs is hence not to take long exposures of the field, but
instead to capture individual bursts using a high-speed camera mounted on a
large aperture telescope. Using ULTRACAM on the 4.2-m William Herschel
Telescope (WHT) we obtained 97100 images of the field of J1819-1458, each of
18.1 milliseconds exposure time and with essentially no dead-time between the
frames. We find no evidence for bursts in u', g' and i' at magnitudes brighter
than 15.1, 17.4 and 16.6 (5 sigma), corresponding to fluxes of less than 3.3,
0.4 and 0.8 mJy at 3560A, 4820A and 7610A, respectively.",2006-07-20T18:18:42Z
"Simulating the formation of molecular clouds. I. Slow formation by
  gravitational collapse from static initial conditions","We study the formation of H2 in the ISM, using a modified version of the
astrophysical magnetohydrodynamical code ZEUS-MP that includes a
non-equilibrium treatment of the formation and destruction of H2. We examine
two different approximations to treat the shielding of H2 against
photodissociation: a local approximation, which gives us a solid lower bound on
the amount of shielding, and a method based on ray-tracing that is considerably
more accurate in some circumstances but that produces results that are harder
to clearly interpret. Either approximation allows one to perform
three-dimensional high-resolution simulations of cloud formation with only
modest computational resources. We also include a detailed treatment of the
thermal behaviour of the gas.
  In this paper, we focus on the problem of molecular cloud formation in
gravitationally unstable, initially static gas. We show that in these
conditions, and for initial densities consistent with those observed in the
cold, neutral atomic phase of the interstellar medium, H2 formation occurs on a
timescale t > 10 Myr, comparable to or longer than the gravitational free-fall
timescale of the cloud. We also show that the collapsing gas very quickly
reaches thermal equilibrium and that the equation of state of the gas is
generally softer than isothermal.
  Finally, we demonstrate that although these results show little sensitivity
to variations in most of our simulation parameters, they are highly sensitive
to the assumed initial density n_i. Reducing n_i significantly increases the
cloud formation timescale and decreases the amount of hydrogen ultimately
converted to H2. (Abridged).",2006-05-04T10:04:41Z
The Mass of the Cosmos,"We point out that the mass of the cosmos on gigaparsec scales can be
measured, owing to the unique geometric role of the maximum in the areal
radius. Unlike all other points on the past null cone, this maximum has an
associated mass, which can be calculated with very few assumptions about the
cosmological model, providing a measurable characteristic of our cosmos. In
combination with luminosities and source counts, it gives the bulk mass to
light ratio. The maximum is particularly sensitive to the values of the bulk
cosmological parameters. In addition, it provides a key reference point in
attempts to connect cosmic geometry with observations. We recommend the
determination of the distance and redshift of this maximum be explicitly
included in the scientific goals of the next generation of reshift surveys. The
maximum in the redshift space density provides a secondary large scale
characteristic of the cosmos.",2006-03-23T13:53:55Z
The period-luminosity relation for type II Cepheids in globular clusters,"We report the result of our near-infrared observations (JHKs) for type II
Cepheids (including possible RV Tau stars) in galactic globular clusters. We
detected variations of 46 variables in 26 clusters (10 new discoveries in seven
clusters) and present their light curves. Their periods range from 1.2 d to
over 80 d. They show a well-defined period-luminosity relation at each
wavelength. Two type II Cepheids in NGC6441 also obey the relation if we assume
the horizontal branch stars in NGC6441 are as bright as those in metal-poor
globular clusters in spite of the high metallicity of the cluster. This result
supports the high luminosity which has been suggested for the RR Lyr variables
in this cluster. The period-luminosity relation can be reproduced using the
pulsation equation (P sqrt(rho)=Q) assuming that all the stars have the same
mass. Cluster RR Lyr variables were found to lie on an extrapolation of the
period-luminosity relation. These results provide important constraints on the
parameters of the variable stars.
  Using Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) data, we show that the type II
Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) fit our period-luminosity relation
within the expected scatter at the shorter periods. However, at long periods
($P>40$ d, i.e. in the RV Tau star range) the LMC field variables are brighter
by about one magnitude than those of similar periods in galactic globular
clusters. The long-period cluster stars also differ from both these LMC stars
and galactic field RV Tau stars in a colour-colour diagram. The reasons for
these differences are discussed.",2006-06-24T10:57:39Z
Globular Clusters in Dwarf Galaxies,"Recent work on globular cluster systems in dwarf galaxies outside the Local
Group is reviewed. Recent large imaging surveys with the Hubble Space Telescope

the properties of massive star clusters in a wide range of galaxy types and
environments. This body of work provides important constraints for theories of
galaxy and star cluster formation and evolution.",2006-06-02T16:56:42Z
Neutral atom transport from the termination shock to 1 AU,"Dynamics of H, D, and heavy Energetic Neutral Atoms (ENA) between the
termination shock and 1 AU is discussed in the context of the forthcoming NASA
SMEX mission IBEX. In particular, effects of the velocity-dependent radiation
pressure on atomic trajectories are considered and ionization losses between TS
and 1 AU are studied. It is shown, among others, that most of the dynamical
effects and ionization losses are induced within a few AU from the Sun, which
translates to the time domain into $\sim 1 - 3$ solar rotations before
detection. This loosens considerably time requirements for tracking the
ionization and radiation pressure history to just prior 3 months. ENA seem
excellent tracers of the processes within the heliospheric interface, with the
transport effects between the termination shock and detector relatively mild
and easy to account for.",2006-04-27T20:16:18Z
Evidence for a Cosmological Phase Transition From the Dark Energy Scale,"A finite vacuum energy density implies the existence of a UV scale for
gravitational modes. This gives a phenomenological scale to the dynamical
equations governing the cosmological expansion that must satisfy constraints
consistent with quantum measurability and spatial flatness. Examination of
these constraints for the observed dark energy density establishes a time
interval from the transition to the present, suggesting major modifications
from the thermal equations of state far from Planck density scales. The
assumption that a phase transition initiates the radiation dominated epoch is
shown under several scenarios to produce fluctuations to the CMB of the order
observed. Quantum measurability constraints (eg. uncertainly relations) define
cosmological scales bounded by luminal expansion rates. It is shown that the
dark energy can consistently be interpreted as being due to the vacuum energy
of collective gravitational modes which manifest as the zero-point motions of
coherent Planck scale mass units prior to the UV scale onset of gravitational
quantum de-coherence for the cosmology.",2006-04-16T15:18:48Z
Deployable Payloads with Starbug,"We explore the range of wide field multi-object instrument concepts taking
advantage of the unique capabilities of the Starbug focal plane positioning
concept. Advances to familiar instrument concepts, such as fiber positioners
and deployable fiber-fed IFUs, are discussed along with image relays and
deployable active sensors. We conceive deployable payloads as components of
systems more traditionally regarded as part of telescope systems rather than
instruments - such as adaptive optics and ADCs. Also presented are some of the
opportunities offered by the truly unique capabilities of Starbug, such as
microtracking to apply intra-field distortion correction during the course of
an observation.",2006-06-14T02:13:26Z
"Accretion, feedback and galaxy bimodality: a comparison of the GalICS
  semi-analytic model and cosmological SPH simulations","We compare the galaxy population of an SPH simulation to those predicted by
the GalICS semi-analytic model and a stripped down version without supernova
and AGN feedback. The SPH simulation and the no-feedback GalICS model make
similar predictions for the baryonic mass functions of galaxies and for the
dependence of these mass functions on environment and redshift. The two methods
also make similar predictions for the galaxy content of dark matter haloes as a
function of halo mass and for the gas accretion history of galaxies. Both the
SPH and no-feedback GalICS models predict a bimodal galaxy population at z=0.
The ""red'' sequence of gas poor, old galaxies is populated mainly by satellite
systems while, contrary to observations, the central galaxies of massive haloes
lie on the ""blue'' star-forming sequence as a result of continuing hot gas
accretion at late times. Furthermore, both models overpredict the observed
baryonic mass function, especially at the high mass end. In the full GalICS
model, supernova-driven outflows reduce the masses of low and intermediate mass
galaxies by about a factor of two. AGN feedback suppresses gas cooling in large
haloes, producing a sharp cut-off in the baryonic mass function and moving the
central galaxies of these massive haloes to the red sequence. Our results imply
that the observational failings of the SPH simulation and the no-feedback
GalICS model are a consequence of missing input physics rather than
computational inaccuracies, that truncating gas accretion by satellite galaxies
automatically produces a bimodal galaxy distribution with a red sequence, but
that explaining the red colours of the most massive galaxies requires a
mechanism like AGN feedback that suppresses the accretion onto central galaxies
in large haloes.",2006-05-31T18:09:52Z
Quasar Microlensing: when compact masses mimic smooth matter,"The magnification induced by gravitational microlensing is sensitive to the
size of a source relative to the Einstein radius, the natural microlensing
scale length. This paper investigates the effect of source size in the case
where the microlensing masses are distributed with a bimodal mass function,
with solar mass stars representing the normal stellar masses, and smaller
masses (down to $8.5\times 10^{-5}$M$_\odot$) representing a dark matter
component. It is found that there exists a critical regime where the dark
matter is initially seen as individual compact masses, but with an increasing
source size the compact dark matter acts as a smooth mass component. This study
reveals that interpretation of microlensing light curves, especially claims of
small mass dark matter lenses embedded in an overall stellar population, must
consider the important influence of the size of the source.",2006-03-22T22:25:19Z
Catalog of Nearby Exoplanets,"We present a catalog of nearby exoplanets, available at http://exoplanets.org
and ApJ 646, 505 (published version available at the link above). It contains
the 172 known low mass companions with orbits established through radial
velocity and transit measurements around stars within 200 pc. We include 5
previously unpublished exoplanets orbiting the stars HD 11964, HD 66428, HD
99109, HD 107148, and HD 164922. We update orbits for 90 additional exoplanets
including many whose orbits have not been revised since their announcement, and
include radial velocity time series from the Lick, Keck, and Anglo-Australian
Observatory planet searches. Both these new and previously published velocities
are more precise here due to improvements in our data reduction pipeline, which
we applied to archival spectra. We present a brief summary of the global
properties of the known exoplanets, including their distributions of orbital
semimajor axis, minimum mass, and orbital eccentricity.",2006-07-21T04:22:19Z
"An updated survey of globular clusters in M 31. I. Classification and
  radial velocity for 76 candidate clusters","Aims - We present the first results of a large spectroscopic survey of
globular clusters and candidate globular clusters in the nearby M~31 galaxy.
The survey is aimed at the classification of known candidate M~31 clusters and
at the study of their kinematic properties. Methods - We obtained
low-resolution spectroscopy (lambda/Dlambda~800-1300) for 133 targets,
including 76 yet-to-confirm candidate clusters (i.e. with no previous
spectroscopic information), 55 already-confirmed genuine M31 clusters, and 2
uncertain candidates. Our observations allowed a reliable estimate of the
target radial velocity, within a typical accuracy of ~+-20km/s. The observed
candidates have been robustly classified according to their radial velocity and
shape parameters that allowed us to confidently discriminate between point
sources and extended objects even from low-spatial-resolution imagery. Results
- In our set of 76 candidates clusters we found: 42 newly-confirmed bona-fide
M~31 clusters, 12 background galaxies, 17 foreground Galactic stars, 2 HII
regions belonging to M31 and 3 unclassified (possibly M31 clusters or
foreground stars) objects. The classification of a few other candidates not
included in our survey has been also reassessed on various observational bases.
All the sources of radial velocity estimates for M31 known globular clusters
available in the literature have been compared and checked, and a homogeneous
general list has been obtained for 349 confirmed clusters with radial velocity.
Conclusions - Our results suggest that a significant number of genuine clusters
(~> 100) is still hidden among the plethora of known candidates proposed by
various authors. Hence our knowledge of the globular cluster system of the M31
galaxy is still far from complete even in terms of simple membership.",2006-05-30T14:34:19Z
"Observation of the March Maximum in the Daemon Flux from Neos in the
  Year 2005: New Efforts and New Effects","The experiments of 2005 aimed at detection of low-velocity (~10-15 km s-1)
daemons falling on to the Earth's surface from Near-Earth, Almost Circular
Heliocentric Orbits (NEACHOs) have corroborated once more the existence of the
March maximum in their flux by raising its confidence level to 99.99%. In
addition, these experiments permitted us to identify several FEU-167-1-type PM
tubes, with a few times thicker inner Al coating, which appear to be capable to
detect, without any scintillator, the crossing of negatively charged daemons.
As a result, detection efficiency increases tens of times, thus raising the
measured level of the March daemon flux to f > 0.5E-7 cm-2s-1.",2006-05-12T10:46:39Z
"Properties of Hickson Compact Groups and of the Loose Groups within
  which they are Embedded","We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) redshift catalogue to look for
galaxies with accordant redshifts in the nearby environment (up to ~2 Mpc) of
15 Hickson Compact Groups (HCG) and 7 more HCG+environment from the literature.
We find that: (a) HCG's tend to be aligned with the overall galaxy distribution
in their ~1 Mpc environment, (b) the well-established orientation effect by
which the group velocity dispersion correlates with group axial ratio, is
present also in the HCG+environment systems, (c) the radial velocity dispersion
of the HCG+environment systems and of ordinary poor groups only weakly depends
on the group richness, (d) the mean absolute K-band magnitude of E/S0 galaxies
in HCGs is similar to that in ordinary poor groups, and is brighter than that
of isolated E/S0's, indicating that they were formed by the merging of two
galaxies of similar luminosity, (e) the fraction of E/S0 galaxies in these HCGs
depends only weakly on the group richness and velocity dispersion, (f) the
fraction of AGNs is similar in the HCGs and their close environment, while that
of starbursts is significantly higher in the HCGs, (g) the fraction of AGNs and
starbursts is anti-correlated with the velocity dispersion of the
HCG+environment systems. Furthermore, the observed fractions of early-type and
active galaxies as well as their correlations with the group velocity
dispersion suggests a picture by which nuclear activity and galaxy
transformation by merging is instigated by effective gravitational interactions
in the low-velocity dispersion groups, which then dynamically evolve via
virialization processes to higher velocity dispersion groups, which thus have a
higher fraction of early-type galaxies.",2006-05-04T23:50:52Z
"GRB 050717: A Long, Short-Lag, High Peak Energy Burst Observed by Swift
  and Konus","The long burst GRB 050717 was observed simultaneously by the Burst Alert
Telescope (BAT) on Swift and the Konus instrument on Wind. Significant hard to
soft spectral evolution was seen. Early gamma-ray and X-ray emission was
detected by both BAT and the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) on Swift. The XRT continued
to observe the burst for 7.1 days and detect it for 1.4 days. The X-ray light
curve showed a classic decay pattern; the afterglow was too faint for a jet
break to be detected. No optical, infrared or ultraviolet counterpart was
discovered despite deep searches within 14 hours of the burst. Two particular
features of the prompt emission make GRB 050717 a very unusual burst. First,
the peak of the nu Fnu spectrum was observed to be 2401(-568/+781) keV for the
main peak, which is the highest value of Epeak ever observed. Secondly, the
spectral lag for GRB 050717 was determined to be 2.5 +- 2.6 ms, consistent with
zero and unusually short for a long burst. This lag measurement suggests that
this burst has a high intrinsic luminosity and hence is at high redshift (z >
2.7). Despite these unusual features GRB 050717 exhibits the classic prompt and
afterglow behaviour of a gamma-ray burst.",2006-05-19T18:15:38Z
The $\dot{M} - M$ relationship in pre-main sequence stars,"We examine the recent data and analysis of Natta et al. concerning the
accretion rate on to young stars as a function of stellar mass, and conclude
that the apparently steep dependence of accretion rate on mass is strongly
driven by selection/detection thresholds. We argue that a convincing
demonstration of a physical relationship between accretion and stellar mass
requires further studies which, as is the case for Natta et al., include
information on upper limits, and which quantify the possible incompleteness of
the sample, at both low and high accretion rates. We point out that the
distribution of detections in the ($M, \dot{M}$)-plane can in principle be used
to test conventional accretion disc evolutionary models, and that higher
sensitivity observations might be able to test the hypothesis of accelerated
disc clearing at late times.",2006-04-10T09:15:29Z
Observing IMBH-IMBH Binary Coalescences via Gravitational Radiation,"Recent numerical simulations have suggested the possibility of forming double
intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) via the collisional runaway scenario in
young dense star clusters. The two IMBHs formed would exchange into a common
binary shortly after their birth, and quickly inspiral and merge. Since
space-borne gravitational wave (GW) observatories such as LISA will be able to
see the late phases of their inspiral out to several Gpc, and LIGO will be able
to see the merger and ringdown out to similar distances, they represent
potentially significant GW sources. In this Letter we estimate the rate at
which LISA and LIGO will see their inspiral and merger in young star clusters,
and discuss the information that can be extracted from the observations. We
find that LISA will likely see tens of IMBH--IMBH inspirals per year, while
advanced LIGO could see ~10 merger and ringdown events per year, with both
rates strongly dependent on the distribution of cluster masses and densities.",2006-05-30T23:57:47Z
"Ultra-Dense Neutron Star Matter, Strange Quark Stars, and the Nuclear
  Equation of State","With central densities way above the density of atomic nuclei, neutron stars
contain matter in one of the densest forms found in the universe. Depending of
the density reached in the cores of neutron stars, they may contain stable
phases of exotic matter found nowhere else in space. This article gives a brief
overview of the phases of ultra-dense matter predicted to exist deep inside
neutron stars and discusses the equation of state associated with such matter.",2006-06-05T20:03:18Z
"Oxygen Chemistry in the Circumstellar Envelope of the Carbon-Rich Star
  IRC+10216","In this paper we study the oxygen chemistry in the C-rich circumstellar
shells of IRC+10216. The recent discoveries of oxygen bearing species (water,
hydroxyl radical and formaldehyde) toward this source challenge our current
understanding of the chemistry in C-rich circumstellar envelopes. The presence
of icy comets surrounding the star or catalysis on iron grain surfaces have
been invoked to explain the presence of such unexpected species. This detailed
study aims at evaluating the chances of producing O-bearing species in the
C-rich circumstellar envelope only by gas phase chemical reactions. For the
inner hot envelope, it is shown that although most of the oxygen is locked in
CO near the photosphere (as expected for a C/O ratio greater than 1), some
stellar radii far away species such as H2O and CO2 have large abundances under
the assumption of thermochemical equilibrium. It is also shown how non-LTE
chemistry makes very difficult the CO-->H2O,CO2 transformation predicted in
LTE. Concerning the chemistry in the outer and colder envelope, we show that
formaldehyde can be formed through gas phase reactions. However, in order to
form water vapor it is necessary to include a radiative association between
atomic oxygen and molecular hydrogen with a quite high rate constant. The
chemical models explain the presence of HCO+ and predict the existence of SO
and H2CS (which has been detected in a 3 mm line survey to be published). We
have modeled the line profiles of H2CO, H2O, HCO+, SO and H2CS using a
non-local radiative transfer model and the abundance profiles predicted by our
chemical model. The results have been compared to the observations and
discussed.",2006-05-25T10:16:12Z
"A non-linear resonance model for the black hole and neutron star QPOs:
  theory supported by observations","Kilohertz Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) have been detected in many
accreting X-ray binaries. It has been suggested that the highest QPO
frequencies observed in the modulation of the X-ray flux reflect a non-linear
resonance between two modes of accreting disk oscillation. This hypothesis
implies certain very general predictions, several of which have been borne out
by observations. Some of these follow from properties of non-linear
oscillators, while the others are specific to oscillations of fluid in strong
gravity. A 3:2 resonant ratio of frequencies can be clearly recognized in the
black-hole as well as in the neutron-star QPO data.",2006-03-31T11:13:58Z
SN 2004aw: Confirming Diversity of Type Ic Supernovae,"Optical and near-infrared observations of the Type Ic supernova (SN) 2004aw
are presented, obtained from day -3 to day +413 with respect to the B-band
maximum. The photometric evolution is characterised by a comparatively slow
post-maximum decline of the light curves. The peaks in redder bands are
significantly delayed relative to the bluer bands, the I-band maximum occurring
8.4 days later than that in B. With an absolute peak magnitude of -18.02 in the
V band the SN can be considered fairly bright, but not exceptional. This also
holds for the U through I bolometric light curve, where SN 2004aw has a
position intermediate between SNe 2002ap and 1998bw. Spectroscopically SN
2004aw provides a link between a normal Type Ic supernova like SN 1994I and the
group of broad-lined SNe Ic. The spectral evolution is rather slow, with a
spectrum at day +64 being still predominantly photospheric. The shape of the
nebular [O I] 6300,6364 line indicates a highly aspherical explosion. Helium
cannot be unambiguously identified in the spectra, even in the near-infrared.
Using an analytical description of the light curve peak we find that the total
mass of the ejecta in SN 2004aw is 3.5-8.0 M_Sun, significantly larger than in
SN 1994I, although not as large as in SN 1998bw. The same model suggests that
about 0.3 M_Sun of {56}Ni has been synthesised in the explosion. No connection
to a GRB can be firmly established.",2006-07-05T16:25:59Z
"Chandra Observations of Nuclear Outflows in the Elliptical Galaxy
  NGC4552 in the Virgo Cluster","We use a 54.4 ks Chandra observation to study nuclear outflow activity in
NGC4552 (M89), an elliptical galaxy in the Virgo Cluster. Chandra images in the
0.5-2 keV band show two ring-like features ~1.7 kpc in diameter in the core of
NGC4552, as reported previously by Filho et al. We use spherically symmetric
point explosion shock models to argue that the shape of the surface brightness
profile across the rims of the rings and the temperature of hot gas in the
rings are consistent with a Mach 1.7 shock carrying mean mechanical power
L_shock ~ 3 x 10^{41} ergs/s produced by a ~1.4 x 10^{55} ergs nuclear outburst
\~1 - 2 Myr ago. We find the gas temperature in the central ~100 pc of the
galaxy to be 1.0 +/- 0.2 keV, hotter than elsewhere in the galaxy, suggesting
that we may be observing directly the reheating of the galaxy ISM by the
outburst.",2006-04-19T12:58:26Z
The Recurrent Eclipse of an Unusual Pre--Main-Sequence Star in IC 348,"The recurrence of a previously documented eclipse of a solar-like
pre--main-sequence star in the young cluster IC 348 has been observed. The
recurrence interval is 4.7 $\pm 0.1$ yr and portions of 4 cycles have now been
seen. The duration of each eclipse is at least 3.5 years, or $\sim 75$% of a
cycle, verifying that this is not an eclipse by a stellar companion. The light
curve is generally symmetric and approximately flat-bottomed. Brightness at
maximum and minimum have been rather stable over the years but the light curve
is not perfectly repetitive or smooth and small variations exist at all phases.
We confirm that the star is redder when fainter. Models are discussed and it is
proposed that this could be a system similar to KH 15D in NGC 2264.
Specifically, it may be an eccentric binary in which a portion of the orbit of
one member is currently occulted during some binary phases by a circumbinary
disk. The star deserves sustained observational attention for what it may
reveal about the circumstellar environment of low-mass stars of planet-forming
age.",2006-06-20T23:26:16Z
Dark viscous fluid described by a unified equation of state in cosmology,"We generalize the $\Lambda$CDM model by introducing a unified EOS to describe
the Universe contents modeled as dark viscous fluid, motivated by the fact that
a single constant equation of state (EOS) $p=-p_0$ ($p_0>0$) reproduces the
$\Lambda$CDM model exactly. This EOS describes the perfect fluid term, the
dissipative effect, and the cosmological constant in a unique framework and the
Friedmann equations can be analytically solved. Especially, we find a relation
between the EOS parameter and the renormalizable condition of a scalar field.
We develop a completely numerical method to perform a $\chi^2$ minimization to
constrain the parameters in a cosmological model directly from the Friedmann
equations, and employ the SNe data with the parameter $\mathcal{A}$ measured
from the SDSS data to constrain our model. The result indicates that the
dissipative effect is rather small in the late-time Universe.",2006-04-30T03:27:31Z
Precise radial velocities of giant stars: I. Stable stars,"Context: Future astrometric missions such as SIM PlanetQuest need very stable
reference stars. K giants have large luminosities, which place them at large
distances and thus the jitter of their photocenters by companions is relatively
small. Therefore K giants would be best suited as references. To confirm this
observationally a radial velocity survey is performed to quantify the level of
intrinsic variability in K giants.
  Aims: From this radial velocity survey we present 34 K giants with an
observed standard deviation of the radial velocity of less than 20 m/s. These
stars are considered ``stable'' and can be used as radial velocity standards.
  Methods: The radial velocity survey contains 179 K giants. All K giants have
a declination between -30 and +65 degrees and visual magnitude of 3-6 mag. The
Coude Auxiliary Telescope (CAT) at UCO/Lick Observatory is used to obtain
radial velocities with an accuracy of 5-8 m/s. The number of epochs for the 34
stable stars ranges from 11 to 28 with a total timespan of the observations
between 1800 and a little over 2200 days.
  Results: The observational results of the 34 ``stable'' stars are shown
together with a discussion about their position in the M_{V} vs. B-V diagram
and some conclusions concerning the radial velocity variability of K giants.
These results are in agreement with the theoretical predictions. K giants in a
certain range of the M_{V} vs. B-V diagram are suitable reference stars.",2006-04-25T11:20:52Z
The James Webb Space Telescope,"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large (6.6m), cold (50K),
infrared-optimized space observatory that will be launched early in the next
decade. The observatory will have four instruments: a near-infrared camera, a
near-infrared multi-object spectrograph, and a tunable filter imager will cover
the wavelength range, 0.6 to 5.0 microns, while the mid-infrared instrument
will do both imaging and spectroscopy from 5.0 to 29 microns. The JWST science
goals are divided into four themes. The End of the Dark Ages: First Light and
Reionization theme seeks to identify the first luminous sources to form and to
determine the ionization history of the early universe. The Assembly of
Galaxies theme seeks to determine how galaxies and the dark matter, gas, stars,
metals, morphological structures, and active nuclei within them evolved from
the epoch of reionization to the present day. The Birth of Stars and
Protoplanetary Systems theme seeks to unravel the birth and early evolution of
stars, from infall on to dust-enshrouded protostars to the genesis of planetary
systems. The Planetary Systems and the Origins of Life theme seeks to determine
the physical and chemical properties of planetary systems including our own,
and investigate the potential for the origins of life in those systems. To
enable these observations, JWST consists of a telescope, an instrument package,
a spacecraft and a sunshield. The telescope consists of 18 beryllium segments,
some of which are deployed. The segments will be brought into optical alignment
on-orbit through a process of periodic wavefront sensing and control. The JWST
operations plan is based on that used for previous space observatories, and the
majority of JWST observing time will be allocated to the international
astronomical community through annual peer-reviewed proposal opportunities.",2006-06-07T21:05:29Z
On the weakness of disc models in bright ULXs,"It is sometimes suggested that phenomenological power-law plus cool
disc-blackbody models represent the simplest, most robust interpretation of the
X-ray spectra of bright ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs); this has been taken
as evidence for the presence of intermediate-mass black holes (BHs) (M ~ 10^3
Msun) in those sources. Here, we assess this claim by comparing the cool
disc-blackbody model with a range of other models. For example, we show that
the same ULX spectra can be fitted equally well by subtracting a disc-blackbody
component from a dominant power-law component, thus turning a soft excess into
a soft deficit. Then, we propose a more complex physical model, based on a
power-law component slightly modified at various energies by smeared emission
and absorption lines from highly-ionized, fast-moving gas. We use the
XMM-Newton/EPIC spectra of two ULXs in Holmberg II and NGC 4559 as examples.
Our main conclusion is that the presence of a soft excess or a soft deficit
depends on the energy range over which we choose to fit the ``true'' power-law
continuum; those small deviations from the power-law spectrum are well modelled
by disc-blackbody components (either in emission or absorption) simply because
they are a versatile fitting tool for most kinds of smooth, broad bumps. Hence,
we argue that those components should not be taken as evidence for accretion
disc emission, nor used to infer BH masses. Finally, we speculate that bright
ULXs could be in a spectral state similar to (or an extension of) the
steep-power-law state of Galactic BH candidates, in which the disc is now
completely comptonized and not directly detectable, and the power-law emission
may be modified by the surrounding, fast-moving, ionized gas.",2006-06-12T18:26:48Z
"The Structure of Rapidly Rotating Late-Type Spiral Galaxies: I.
  Photometry, HI and Optical Kinematics","We present I-band photometry, long-slit optical spectroscopy, and new
aperture synthesis HI observations for eight late-type spirals with rotation
velocities in the range 243 km/s < V_{rot} < 308 km/s. The sample will be used
to study the structure and angular momentum of disks at the high-mass end of
the spiral galaxy population; here we discuss the basic properties of these
``fast rotators'', and derive hybrid optical/HI rotation curves for each.
Despite the presence of HI warps and low-mass companions in many systems, their
kinematics are regular and there is excellent agreement between optical and HI
tracers near the optical radius r_{opt}. At high inclinations at which
projection effects are negligible, the sample galaxies exhibit flat,
featureless rotation curves out to their last measured points at
1.7r_{opt}--3.5 r_{opt}. The intermediate inclination systems are also
consistent with a constant rotation amplitude for r > 0.5 r_{opt}. We therefore
find no evidence for declining rotation curves at the high-mass end of the
late-type spiral galaxy population. Combining our data with the compilation of
spirals with reliable outer HI kinematics from the work of Casertano & van
Gorkom, we find no convincing trends between logarithmic outer rotation curve
slopes and rotation amplitudes or surface brightnesses for galaxies with
V_{rot} > 220 km/s. Correlations between these slopes and morphological types
or disk scale lengths are also marginal in this regime.",2006-05-22T13:44:48Z
"The Three Dimensional Structural Shape of the Gravitational Potential in
  the Local Group","The Local Group is a small galaxy cluster with the membership of 62 nearby
galaxies including the Milky Way and M31. Although the Local Group has yet to
be virialized, it interacts with the surrounding matter as one gravitationally
bound system. To understand the formation and evolution of the Local Group as
well as its member galaxies, it is important to reconstruct the gravitational
potential field from the surrounding matter distribution in the local cosmic
web. By measuring the anisotropy in the spatial distribution of the Local Group
galaxies, which is assumed to be induced by the local gravitational tidal field
, we resolve the three dimensional structure of the gravitational potential in
the vicinity of the Milky Way smoothed on the Local Group mass scale. Our
results show that (i) the minor principal axis of the Local Group tidal field
is in the equatorial direction of alpha_{p}=15^{h}00^{m} and delta_{p}=20^{d};
(ii) it has a prolate shape with axial ratio of 0.5 +/- 0.13; (iii) the global
tides in the Local Group is quite strong, which may provide a partial
explanation for the low abundance of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group.",2006-05-10T06:14:40Z
"Terrestrial Consequences of Spectral and Temporal Variability in
  Ionizing Photon Events","Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) directed at Earth from within a few kpc may have
damaged the biosphere, primarily though changes in atmospheric chemistry which
admit greatly increased Solar UV. However, GRBs are highly variable in spectrum
and duration. Recent observations indicate that short (~0.1 s) burst GRBs,
which have harder spectra, may be sufficiently abundant at low redshift that
they may offer an additional significant effect. A much longer timescale is
associated with shock breakout luminosity observed in the soft X-ray (~10^3 s)
and UV (~10^5 s) emission, and radioactive decay gamma-ray line radiation
emitted during the light curve phase of supernovae (~10^7 s). Here we
generalize our atmospheric computations to include a broad range of peak photon
energies and investigate the effect of burst duration while holding total
fluence and other parameters constant. The results can be used to estimate the
probable impact of various kinds of ionizing events (such as short GRBs, X-ray
flashes, supernovae) upon the terrestrial atmosphere. We find that the ultimate
intensity of atmospheric effects varies only slightly with burst duration from
10^-1 s to 10^8 s. Therefore, the effect of many astrophysical events causing
atmospheric ionization can be approximated without including time development.
Detailed modeling requires specification of the season and latitude of the
event. Harder photon spectra produce greater atmospheric effects for spectra
with peaks up to about 20 MeV, because of greater penetration into the
stratosphere.",2006-04-26T23:04:45Z
The flow field in the sunspot canopy,"We investigate the flow field in the sunspot canopy using simultaneous Stokes
vector spectropolarimetry of three sunspots ($\theta$ = 27, 50, 75 deg) and
their surroundings in visible (630.15 and 630.25 nm) and near infrared (1564.8
and 1565.2 nm) neutral iron lines.} {To calibrate the Doppler shifts, we
compare an absolute velocity calibration using the telluric $O_2$-line at
630.20 nm and a relative velocity calibration using the Doppler shift of Stokes
V profiles in the umbra under the assumption that the umbra is at rest. Both
methods yield the same result within the calibration uncertainties (~150 m/s).
We study the radial dependence of Stokes V profiles in the directions of disk
center and limb side. Maps of Stokes V profile shifts, polarity, amplitude
asymmetry, field strength and magnetic field azimuth provide strong evidence
for the presence of a magnetic canopy and for the existence of a radial outflow
in the canopy. Our findings indicate that the Evershed flow does not cease
abruptly at the white-light spot boundary, but that at least a part of the
penumbral Evershed flow continues into the magnetic canopy.",2006-04-13T14:10:27Z
Non-Gaussian Inflationary Perturbations from the dS/CFT Correspondence,"We use the dS/CFT correspondence and bulk gravity to predict the form of the
renormalized holographic three-point correlation function of the operator which
is dual to the inflaton field perturbation during single-field, slow-roll
inflation. Using Maldcaena's formulation of the correspondence, this correlator
can be related to the three-point function of the curvature perturbation
generated during single-field inflation, and we find exact agreement with
previous bulk QFT calculations. This provides a consistency check on existing
derivations of the non-Gaussianity from single-field inflation and also yields
insight into the nature of the dS/CFT correspondence. As a result of our
calculation, we obtain the properly renormalized dS/CFT one-point function,
including boundary contributions where derivative interactions are present in
the bulk. In principle, our method may be employed to derive the n-point
correlators of the inflationary curvature perturbation within the context of
(n-1)th-order perturbation theory, rather than nth-order theory as in
conventional approaches.",2006-04-10T16:25:01Z
"Spitzer/IRAC Photometry of M, L, and T Dwarfs","We present the results of a program to acquire photometry for eighty-six
late-M, L, and T dwarfs using the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer
Space Telescope. We examine the behavior of these cool dwarfs in various
color-color and color-magnitude diagrams composed of near-IR and IRAC data. The
T dwarfs exhibit the most distinctive positions in these diagrams. In M_5.8
versus [5.8]-[8.0], the IRAC data for T dwarfs are not monotonic in either
magnitude or color, giving the clearest indication yet that the T dwarfs are
not a one parameter family in Teff. Because metallicity does not vary enough in
the solar neighborhood to act as the second parameter, the most likely
candidate then is gravity, which in turn translates to mass. Among objects with
similar spectral type, the range of mass suggested by our sample is about a
factor of five (~70 M_Jup to ~15 M_Jup), with the less massive objects making
up the younger members of the sample. We also find the IRAC 4.5 micron fluxes
to be lower than expected, from which we infer a stronger CO fundamental band
at ~4.67 microns. This suggests that equilibrium CH_4/CO chemistry
underestimates the abundance of CO in T dwarf atmospheres, confirming earlier
results based on M-band observations from the ground. In combining IRAC
photometry with near-IR JHK photometry and parallax data, we find the
combination of Ks, IRAC 3.6 micron, and 4.5 micron bands to provide the best
color-color discrimination for a wide range of M, L, and T dwarfs. Also
noteworthy is the M_Ks versus Ks-[4.5] relation, which shows a smooth
progression over spectral type and splits the M, L, and T types cleanly.",2006-06-18T19:07:23Z
"Inflation model constraints from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
  Probe three-year data","We extract parameters relevant for distinguishing among single-field
inflation models from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)
three-year data set, and also from WMAP in combination with the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxy power spectrum. Our analysis leads to the following
conclusions: 1) the Harrison--Zel'dovich model is consistent with both data
sets at a 95% confidence level; 2) there is no strong evidence for running of
the spectral index of scalar perturbations; 3) Potentials of the form V \propto
\phi^p are consistent with the data for p = 2, and are marginally consistent
with the WMAP data considered alone for p = 4, but ruled out by WMAP combined
with SDSS. We perform a ""Monte Carlo reconstruction"" of the inflationary
potential, and find that: 1) there is no evidence to support an observational
lower bound on the amplitude of gravitational waves produced during inflation;
2) models such as simple hybrid potentials which evolve toward an inflationary
late-time attractor in the space of flow parameters are strongly disfavored by
the data, 3) models selected with even a weak slow-roll prior strongly cluster
in the region favoring a ""red"" power spectrum and no running of the spectral
index, consistent with simple single-field inflation models.",2006-05-13T21:19:02Z
Discovery of 14 radio pulsars in a survey of the Magellanic Clouds,"A systematic survey of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds for radio
pulsars using the Parkes radio telescope and the 20-cm multibeam receiver has
resulted in the discovery of 14 pulsars and the redetection of five of the
eight previously known spin-powered pulsars believed to lie in the Magellanic
Clouds. Of the 14 new discoveries, 12 are believed to lie within Clouds, three
in the Small Cloud and nine in the Large Cloud, bringing the total number of
known spin-powered pulsars in the Clouds to 20. Averaged over all positions
within the survey area, the survey had a limiting flux density of about 0.12
mJy. Observed dispersion measures suggest that the mean free electron density
in the Magellanic Clouds is similar to that in the disk of our Galaxy. The
observed radio luminosities have little or no dependence on pulsar period or
characteristic age and the differential luminosity function is consistent with
a power-law slope of -1 as is observed for Galactic pulsars.",2006-04-20T03:21:55Z
"Diffuse, Non-Thermal X-ray Emission from the Galactic Star Cluster
  Westerlund 1","We present the diffuse X-ray emission identified in Chandra observations of
the young, massive Galactic star cluster Westerlund 1. After removing
point-like X-ray sources down to a completeness limit of 2e31 erg/s, we
identify 3e34 erg/s (2--8 keV) of diffuse emission. The spatial distribution of
the emission can be described as a slightly-elliptical Lorentzian core with a
half-width half-maximum along the major axis of 25+/-1"", similar to the
distribution of point sources in the cluster, plus a 5' halo of extended
emission. The spectrum of the diffuse emission is dominated by a hard continuum
component that can be described as a kT>3 keV thermal plasma that has a low
iron abundance (<0.3 solar), or as non-thermal emission that could be stellar
light that is inverse-Compton scattered by MeV electrons. Only 5% of the flux
is produced by a kT=0.7 keV plasma. The low luminosity of the thermal emission
and the lack of a 6.7 keV iron line suggests that <40,000 unresolved stars with
masses between 0.3 and 2 Msun are present in the cluster. Moreover, the flux in
the diffuse emission is a factor of two lower than would be expected from a
supersonically-expanding cluster wind, and there is no evidence for thermal
remnants produced by supernovae. Less than 1e-5 of the mechanical luminosity of
the cluster is dissipated as 2--8 keV X-rays, leaving a large amount of energy
that either is radiated at other wavelengths, is dissipated beyond the bounds
of our image, or escapes into the intergalactic medium.",2006-06-20T18:47:01Z
Disks around young stars with VLTI/MIDI,"We report on observations of circumstellar disks around young stars that have
been obtained with the MIDI instrument, which is mounted on the VLT
Interferometer and operates in the 10 micrometer atmospheric window. The
maximum spatial resolution of 5 milli-arcsec corresponds to sub-AU scales at
the distance to nearby star formation regions. Thus, we can study the disks on
the spatial scales at which important processes occur, such as accretion, dust
processing, and planet formation. The main results obtained so far can be
summarized as follows: 1. The measured interferometric visibilities are in good
qualitative agreement with those predicted by models of circumstellar disks. In
particular, a predicted correlation between the strength of the far-infrared
excess and the spatial structure of the disk is confirmed by direct
measurements; 2. In several objects strong evidence for deviations from
circular symmetry is present, indicating that an inclined disk is indeed the
dominant component seen in the mid-infrared; 3. The dust properties are not
uniform over the disk, but are instead a strong function of distance to the
central star. The dust in the innermost disk regions is observed to be more
``processed'' than the dust further out, both in Herbig Ae star disks and in
those around T-Tauri stars.",2006-07-17T15:38:52Z
"Model selection forecasts for the spectral index from the Planck
  satellite","The recent WMAP3 results have placed measurements of the spectral index n_S
in an interesting position. While parameter estimation techniques indicate that
the Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum n_S=1 is strongly excluded (in the absence of
tensor perturbations), Bayesian model selection techniques reveal that the case
against n_S=1 is not yet conclusive. In this paper, we forecast the ability of
the Planck satellite mission to use Bayesian model selection to convincingly
exclude (or favour) the Harrison-Zel'dovich model.",2006-05-01T12:15:48Z
"ATCA observations of the galaxy cluster Abell 3921 - I. Radio emission
  from the central merging sub-clusters","We present the analysis of our 13 and 22 cm ATCA observations of the central
region of the merging galaxy cluster A3921 (z=0.094). We investigated the
effects of the major merger between two sub-clusters on the star formation (SF)
and radio emission properties of the confirmed cluster members. The origin of
SF and the nature of radio emission in cluster galaxies was investigated by
comparing their radio, optical and X-ray properties. We also compared the radio
source counts and the percentage of detected radio galaxies with literature
data. We detected 17 radio sources above the flux density limit of 0.25
mJy/beam in the central field of A3921, among which 7 are cluster members. 9
galaxies with star-forming optical spectra were observed in the collision
region of the merging sub-clusters. They were not detected at radio
wavelengths, giving upper limits for their star formation rate significantly
lower than those typically found in late-type, field galaxies. Most of these
star-forming objects are therefore really located in the high density part of
the cluster, and they are not infalling field objects seen in projection at the
cluster centre. Their SF episode is probably related to the cluster collision
that we observe in its very central phase. None of the galaxies with
post-starburst optical spectra was detected down our 2$\sigma$ flux density
limit, confirming that they are post-starburst and not dusty star-forming
objects. We finally detected a narrow-angle tail (NAT) source associated with
the second brightest cluster galaxy (BG2), whose diffuse component is a partly
detached pair of tails from an earlier period of activity of the BG2 galaxy.",2006-07-06T15:17:23Z
Constraining fundamental physics with the cosmic microwave background,"The temperature anisotropies and polarization of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) radiation provide a window back to the physics of the early
universe. They encode the nature of the initial fluctuations and so can reveal
much about the physical mechanism that led to their generation. In this
contribution we review what we have learnt so far about early-universe physics
from CMB observations, and what we hope to learn with a new generation of
high-sensitivity, polarization-capable instruments.",2006-06-22T13:05:26Z
The Rotation Measure and 3.5mm Polarization of Sgr A*,"We report the detection of variable linear polarization from Sgr A* at a
wavelength of 3.5mm, the longest wavelength yet at which a detection has been
made. The mean polarization is 2.1 +/- 0.1% at a position angle of 16 +/- 2 deg
with rms scatters of 0.4% and 9 deg over the five epochs. We also detect
polarization variability on a timescale of days. Combined with previous
detections over the range 150-400GHz (750-2000 microns), the average
polarization position angles are all found to be consistent with a rotation
measure of -4.4 +/- 0.3 x 10^5 rad/m^2. This implies that the Faraday rotation
occurs external to the polarized source at all wavelengths. This implies an
accretion rate ~0.2 - 4 x 10^-8 Msun/yr for the accretion density profiles
expected of ADAF, jet and CDAF models and assuming that the region at which
electrons in the accretion flow become relativistic is within 10 R_S. The
inferred accretion rate is inconsistent with ADAF/Bondi accretion. The
stability of the mean polarization position angle between disparate
polarization observations over the frequency range limits fluctuations in the
accretion rate to less than 5%. The flat frequency dependence of the inter-day
polarization position angle variations also makes them difficult to attribute
to rotation measure fluctuations, and suggests that both the magnitude and
position angle variations are intrinsic to the emission.",2006-06-15T16:37:12Z
"On the X-ray, optical emission line and black hole mass properties of
  local Seyfert galaxies","We investigate the relation between X-ray nuclear emission, optical emission
line luminosities and black hole masses for a sample of 47 Seyfert galaxies.
The sample, which has been selected from the Palomar optical spectroscopic
survey of nearby galaxies (Ho, Filippenko & Sargent 1997), covers a wide range
of nuclear powers, from L_{2-10 keV} ~ 10^{43} erg/s down to very low
luminosities (L_{2-10 keV} ~ 10^{38} erg/s). Best available data from Chandra,
XMM-Newton and, in a few cases, ASCA observations have been considered. Thanks
to the good spatial resolution available from these observations and a proper
modeling of the various spectral components, it has been possible to obtain
accurate nuclear X-ray luminosities not contaminated by off-nuclear sources
and/or diffuse emission. X-ray luminosities have then been corrected taking
into account the likely candidate Compton thick sources, which are a high
fraction (> 30%) among type 2 Seyferts in our sample. The main result of this
study is that we confirm strong linear correlations between 2-10 keV,
[OIII]\lambda5007, H_{alpha} luminosities which show the same slope as quasars
and luminous Seyfert galaxies, independent of the level of nuclear activity
displayed. Moreover, despite the wide range of Eddington ratios (L/L_{Edd})
tested here (six orders of magnitude, from 0.1 down to ~ 10^{-7}), no
correlation is found between the X-ray or optical emission line luminosities
and the black hole mass. Our results suggest that Seyfert nuclei in our sample
are consistent with being a scaled-down version of more luminous AGN.",2006-05-09T14:55:32Z
"Probing the Proper Motion of the Central Compact Object in Puppis-A with
  the Chandra High Resolution Camera","By making use of the sub-arcsecond angular resolution of the High Resolution
Camera (HRC-I) aboard the Chandra X-ray satellite we have examined the central
compact object RX J0822-4300, in the supernova remnant Puppis-A for a possible
proper motion. Using data which span an epoch of 1952 days we found the
position of RX J0822-4300, different by $0.574\pm0.184$ arcsec, implying a
proper motion of $\mu=107.49\pm34.46$ mas/yr. For a distance of 2.2 kpc, this
proper motion is equivalent to a recoil velocity of $1121.79\pm 359.60$ km/s.
The position angle is found to be $241^\circ \pm 24^\circ$. Since both the
magnitude and direction of the proper motion are in agreement with the birth
place of RX J0822-4300, being near to the optical expansion center of the
supernova remnant, the result presented in this letter is a promising
indication of a fast moving compact object in a supernova remnant. Although the
positional shift inferred from the current data is significant at a
$\sim3\sigma$ level only, one or more future HRC-I observations can obtain a
much larger positional separation and further constrain the measurement.",2006-06-30T10:39:20Z
Results from the GMT Ground-Layer Experiment at the Magellan Telescopes,"We present results from our two year study of ground-layer turbulence as seen
through the 6.5-meter Magellan Telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory. The
experiment consists of multiple, moderate resolution, Shack-Hartmann wavefront
sensors deployed over a large 16 arcminute field. Over the two years of the
experiment, the ground-layer turbulence has been sampled on eleven nights in a
variety of seeing and wind conditions. On most nights the ground-layer
turbulence contributes 10% to the total visible-band seeing, although a few
nights exhibit ground-layer contributions up to 30%. We present the
ground-layer turbulence on the sampled nights as well as a demonstration of its
strength as a function of field size. This information is combined with data
from a MASS-DIMM seeing monitor adjacent to the Magellan Telescopes to infer
the annual ground-layer contribution to seeing at Las Campanas.",2006-06-13T23:17:13Z
"Radiative Hydrodynamic Models of Optical and Ultraviolet Emission from M
  Dwarf Flares","We report on radiative hydrodynamic simulations of M dwarf stellar flares and
compare the model predictions to observations of several flares. The flares
were simulated by calculating the hydrodynamic response of a model M dwarf
atmosphere to a beam of non-thermal electrons. Radiative backwarming through
numerous soft X-ray, extreme ultraviolet, and ultraviolet transitions are also
included. The equations of radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium are
treated in non-LTE for many transitions of hydrogen, helium and the Ca II ion
allowing the calculation of detailed line profiles and continuum radiation. Two
simulations were carried out, with electron beam fluxes corresponding to
moderate and strong beam heating. In both cases we find the dynamics can be
naturally divided into two phases: an initial gentle phase in which hydrogen
and helium radiate away much of the beam energy, and an explosive phase
characterized by large hydrodynamic waves. During the initial phase, lower
chromospheric material is evaporated into higher regions of the atmosphere
causing many lines and continua to brighten dramatically. The He II Lya line is
especially enhanced, becoming the brightest line in the flaring spectrum. The
hydrogen Balmer lines also become much brighter and show very broad line
widths, in agreement with observations. We compare our predicted Balmer
decrements to decrements calculated for several flare observations and find the
predictions to be in general agreement with the observations. During the
explosive phase both condensation and evaporation waves are produced. The
moderate flare simulation predicts a peak evaporation wave of 130 km/s and a
condensation wave of 30 km/s. The velocity of the condensation wave matches
velocities observed in several transition region lines.",2006-03-08T17:30:23Z
"CMB power spectrum contribution from cosmic strings using
  field-evolution simulations of the Abelian Higgs model","We present the first field-theoretic calculations of the contribution made by
cosmic strings to the temperature power spectrum of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB). Unlike previous work, in which strings were modeled as
idealized one-dimensional objects, we evolve the simplest example of an
underlying field theory containing local U(1) strings, the Abelian Higgs model.
Limitations imposed by finite computational volumes are overcome using the
scaling property of string networks and a further extrapolation related to the
lessening of the string width in comoving coordinates. The strings and their
decay products, which are automatically included in the field theory approach,
source metric perturbations via their energy-momentum tensor, the unequal-time
correlation functions of which are used as input into the CMB calculation
phase. These calculations involve the use of a modified version of CMBEASY,
with results provided over the full range of relevant scales. We find that the
string tension $\mu$ required to normalize to the WMAP 3-year data at multipole
$\ell = 10$ is $G\mu = [2.04\pm0.06\textrm{(stat.)}\pm0.12\textrm{(sys.)}]
\times 10^{-6}$, where we have quoted statistical and systematic errors
separately, and $G$ is Newton's constant. This is a factor 2-3 higher than
values in current circulation.",2006-04-30T22:59:23Z
Evidence for Differential Rotation on a T Tauri Star,"Five years of photometric monitoring of the T Tauri star HBC 338 in NGC 1333
has revealed that it is a periodic variable, but the period has changed
significantly with time. From 2000-2003, a period near 5.6 days was observed,
while in the last two seasons, the dominant period is near 4.6 days. No other T
Tauri star has been seen to change its period by such a large percentage. We
propose a model in which a differentially rotating star is seen nearly
equator-on and a high latitude spot has gradually been replaced by a low
latitude spot. We show that this model provides an excellent fit to the
observed shapes of the light curves at each epoch. The amplitude and sense of
the inferred differential rotation is similar to what is seen on the Sun. This
may be surprising given the likely high degree of magnetic surface activity on
the star relative to the Sun but we note that HBC 338 is clearly an exceptional
T Tauri star.",2006-06-07T19:05:38Z
Search for an infrared counterpart of IGR J16358-4756,"We report here on near infrared observations of the field around IGR
J16358-4756. The source belongs to the new class of highly absorbed X-ray
binaries discovered by IBIS/INTEGRAL. Our primary goal was to identify the
infrared counterpart of the source, previously suggested to be a LMXB and then
further reclassified as a HMXB. We have made use of Chandra observations of the
source in order to better constrain the number of possible counterparts. Using
the differential photometry technique, in observations spanning a timescale of
1 month, we found no long term variability in our observations. This is
compatible, and we suggest here, that the source is a HMXB.",2006-04-07T13:17:58Z
"Confronting X-ray Emission Models with the Highest-Redshift
  Kiloparsec-scale Jets: the z=3.89 Jet in Quasar 1745+624","A newly identified kiloparsec-scale X-ray jet in the high-redshift z=3.89
quasar 1745+624 is studied with multi-frequency Very Large Array, Hubble Space
Telescope, and Chandra X-ray imaging data. This is only the third large-scale
X-ray jet beyond z>3 known and is further distinguished as being the most
luminous relativistic jet observed at any redshift, exceeding 10^45 erg/s in
both the radio and X-ray bands. Apart from the jet's extreme redshift,
luminosity, and high inferred equipartition magnetic field (in comparison to
local analogues), its basic properties such as X-ray/radio morphology and radio
polarization are similar to lower-redshift examples. Its resolved linear
structure and the convex broad-band spectral energy distributions of three
distinct knots are also a common feature among known powerful X-ray jets at
lower-redshift. Relativistically beamed inverse Compton and `non-standard'
synchrotron models have been considered to account for such excess X-ray
emission in other jets; both models are applicable to this high-redshift
example but with differing requirements for the underlying jet physical
properties, such as velocity, energetics, and electron acceleration processes.
One potentially very important distinguishing characteristic between the two
models is their strongly diverging predictions for the X-ray/radio emission
with increasing redshift. This is considered, though with the limited sample of
three z>3 jets it is apparent that future studies targeted at very
high-redshift jets are required for further elucidation of this issue. Finally,
from the broad-band jet emission we estimate the jet kinetic power to be no
less than 10^46 erg/s, which is about 10% of the Eddington luminosity
corresponding to this galaxy's central [abridged]",2006-06-12T01:44:08Z
Nonlinear Development of Thermal Instability without External Forcing,"Supersonic turbulent motions are the remarkable properties of interstellar
medium. Previous numerical simulations have demonstrated that the thermal
instability in a shock-compressed layer produces the supersonic turbulent
motion that does not decay. In this paper we focus on two- and
three-dimensional numerical simulations of the non-linear development of simple
thermal instability incorporating physical viscosity but without any external
forcing, in order to isolate the effects of various processes responsible for
the long-lasting turbulent motion. As the initial condition for our
simulations, we set up spatially uniform gas with thermally unstable
temperature in a box with periodic boundaries. After the linear growth stage of
the thermal instability, two-phase medium forms where cold clumps are embedded
in warm medium, and turbulent fluid flow clearly visible as translational
motions of the cold clumps does not decay in a viscous dissipation timescale.
The amplitude of the turbulent velocity increases when we reduce the Prandtl
number that is the non-dimensional ratio of kinetic viscosity to thermal
conduction: the saturation amplitude does not change when we increase the
viscosity and thermal conduction coefficients simultaneously in order to keep
the Prandtl number. This shows that the thermal conduction plays an important
role in maintaining turbulent motions against viscous dissipation. The
amplitude also increases when we increase the ratio of the computational domain
length $L$ to the cooling length $\lambda_{\rm c}$ that is defined by the
product of the cooling time and the sound speed, as long as $L \la 100
\lambda_{\rm c}$.",2006-05-20T12:15:46Z
OB Stars in the Solar Neighborhood II: Kinematics,"Using the spatial classification method and the structural parameters
estimated for the Gould Belt (GB) and the local Galactic disk (LGD) from a
previous paper, we have evaluated spatial membership probabilities for a sample
of O and B stars from the Hipparcos catalogue (ESA 1997) with available proper
motions and radial velocity data. Thus being able to study the space velocity
fields of both systems, we conclude that the GB and the LGD present different
statistical distributions, both in the velocity space as well as in the phase
space. In the light of the existence of both systems we analyze different
kinematic aspects in the vicinity of the Sun, and we find the GB to be
responsible for the highly negative vertex deviation found for the OB stars in
the solar neighborhood. We also find that the GB sensibly alters the estimation
of Oort's constants in the Galactic disk; thus, in order to establish
comparisons with other kinematic studies based in older stellar populations, a
careful pruning of the GB members must be performed. Further analysis of the GB
velocity field and the moving groups that contribute to it suggest the
possibility that the GB can be the result of a chance superposition of moving
groups. We propose for future investigations the dynamical analysis of these
moving groups in order to probe the origin of the GB.",2006-05-17T09:13:18Z
The Fifth VLBA Calibrator Survey: VCS5,"This paper presents the fifth part of the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA)
Calibrator Survey (VCS), containing 569 sources not observed previously with
very long baseline interferometry in geodetic or absolute astrometry programs.
This campaign has two goals: (i) to observe additional sources which, together
with previous survey results, form a complete sample, (ii) to find new strong
sources suitable as phase calibrators. This VCS extension was based on three
24-hour VLBA observing sessions in 2005. It detected almost all extragalactic
flat-spectrum sources with correlated flux density greater than 200 mJy at 8.6
GHz above declination -30 degrees which were not observed previously. Source
positions with milliarcsecond accuracy were derived from astrometric analysis
of ionosphere-free combinations of group delays determined from the 2.3 GHz and
8.6 GHz frequency bands. The VCS5 catalog of source positions, plots of
correlated flux density versus projected baseline length, contour plots and
FITS files of naturally weighted CLEAN images, as well as calibrated visibility
function files are available on the Web at http://vlbi.gsfc.nasa.gov/vcs5",2006-07-23T13:07:29Z
A catalogue of ULX coincidences with FIRST radio sources,"We search for ultra luminous X-ray source (ULXs) radio counterparts located
in nearby galaxies in order to constrain their physical nature. Our work is
based on a systematic cross-identification of the most recent and extensive
available ULX catalogues and archival radio data. A catalogue of 70 positional
coincidences is reported. Most of them are located within the galaxy nucleus.
Among them, we find 11 new cases of non-nuclear ULX sources with possibly
associated radio emission.",2006-05-22T11:14:51Z
X-ray Properties of Intermediate-Redshift Groups of Galaxies,"We have undertaken a multiwavelength project to study the relatively unknown
properties of groups and poor clusters of galaxies at intermediate redshifts.
In this paper, we describe the XMM-Newton observations of six X-ray selected
groups with 0.2<z<0.6. The X-ray properties of these systems are generally in
good agreement with the properties of low-redshift groups. They appear to
follow the scaling relations between luminosity, temperature, and velocity
dispersion defined by low-redshift groups and clusters. The X-ray emission in
four of the six groups is also centered on a dominant early-type galaxy. The
lack of a bright elliptical galaxy at the peak of the group X-ray emission is
rare at low-redshifts, and the other two groups may be less dynamically
evolved. We find indications of excess entropy in these systems over
self-similar predictions out to large radii. We also confirm the presence of at
least one X-ray luminous AGN associated with a group member galaxy and find
several other potential group AGN.",2006-06-02T20:56:27Z
"Images of Vega Dust Ring at 350 and 450 microns: New Clues to the
  Trapping of Multiple-Sized Dust Particles in Planetary Resonances","We have used the SHARC II camera at Caltech Submillimeter Observatory to make
350 and 450 micron images of the Vega dust disk at spatial resolutions (FWHM)
of 9.7"" and 11.1"", respectively. The images show a ring-like morphology (radius
\~ 100 AU) with inhomogeneous structure that is qualitatively different from
that previously reported at 850 microns and longer wavelengths. We attribute
the 350/450 micron emission to a grain population whose characteristic size (~
1 mm) is intermediate between that of the cm-sized grains responsible for
emission longward of 850 microns and the much smaller grains (< 18 microns) in
the extensive halo, visible at 70 microns, discussed by Su et al. (2005). We
have combined our submillimeter images with Spitzer data at 70 microns to
produce 2-d maps of line-of-sight optical depth (relative column density).
These ""tau maps"" suggest that the mm-sized grains are located preferentially in
three symmetrically-located concentrations. If so, then this structure could be
understood in terms of the Wyatt (2003) model in which planetesimals are
trapped in the mean motion resonances of a Neptune-mass planet at 65 AU,
provided allowance is made for the spatial distribution of dust grains to
differ from that of the parent planetesimals. The peaks of the tau maps are, in
fact, located near the expected positions corresponding to the 4:3 resonance.
If this identification is confirmed by future observations, it would resolve an
ambiguity with regard to the location of the planet.",2006-06-14T16:53:02Z
The velocity dispersion and mass profile of the Milky Way,"We re-analyse the velocity-dispersion profile sigma(r) at radii r>10 kpc in
the Galactic stellar halo, recently derived by Battaglia et al. (2005), who
concluded that, for constant velocity anisotropy of the tracers, these data
rule out a flat circular-speed curve for the Milky Way. However, we demonstrate
that if one makes the natural assumption that the tracer density is truncated
at r_t >~ 160 kpc and falls off significantly more steeply than r^-3.5 at r >~
80 kpc, then these data are consistent with a flat circular-speed curve and a
constant velocity anisotropy comparable to that observed for halo stars in the
Solar neighbourhood. We also consider a more detailed mass model with an
exponential stellar disc and an extended non-isothermal dark-matter halo. In
this two-component model, the Milky Way's virial radius and mass are r_vir =
200 kpc and M_vir = 1.5 x 10^12 M_sun. Still assuming the tracers' velocity
anisotropy to be constant (at beta=0.5) we again find good agreement with the
observed sigma(r), so long as the tracer density is truncated near the virial
radius. These data by themselves do not allow to differentiate between
different dark-halo or total-mass models for the Milky Way, nor between
different velocity-anisotropy profiles for the tracers.",2006-03-30T16:42:34Z
Stochastic wake field particle acceleration in Gamma-Ray Bursts,"Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) prompt emission can, for specific conditions, be so
powerful and short-pulsed to strongly influence any surrounding plasma. In this
paper, we briefly discuss the possibility that a very intense initial burst of
radiation produced by GRBs satisfy the intensity and temporal conditions to
cause stochastic wake-field particle acceleration in a surrounding plasma of
moderate density. Recent laboratory experiments clearly indicate that powerful
laser beam pulses of tens of femtosecond duration hitting on target plasmas
cause efficient particle acceleration and betatron radiation up to tens of MeV.
We consider a simple but realistic GRB model for which particle wake-field
acceleration can first be excited by a very strong low-energy precursor, and
then be effective in producing the observed prompt X-ray and gamma-ray GRB
emission. We also briefly discuss some of the consequences of this novel GRB
emission mechanism.",2006-04-11T10:24:53Z
"Empirical distributions of galactic $λ$ spin parameters from the
  SDSS","Using simple dimensional arguments for both spiral and elliptical galaxies,
we present formulas to derive an estimate of the halo spin parameter $\lambda$
for any real galaxy, in terms of common observational parameters. This allows a
rough estimate of $\lambda$, which we apply to a large volume limited sample of
galaxies taken from the SDSS data base. The large numbers involved (11,597)
allow the derivation of reliable $\lambda$ distributions, as signal adds up
significantly in spite of the errors in the inferences for particular galaxies.
We find that if the observed distribution of $\lambda$ is modeled with a
log-normal function, as often done for this distribution in dark matter halos
that appear in cosmological simulations, we obtain parameters $\lambda_{0}=0.04
\pm 0.005$ and $\sigma_{\lambda}=0.51 \pm 0.05$, interestingly consistent with
values derived from simulations. For spirals, we find a good correlation

Growth of galactic bulges by mergers. II. Low-density satellites,"Satellite accretion events have been invoked for mimicking the internal
secular evolutionary processes of bulge growth. However, N-body simulations of
satellite accretions have paid little attention to the evolution of bulge
photometric parameters, to the processes driving this evolution, and to the
consistency of this evolution with observations. We want to investigate whether
satellite accretions indeed drive the growth of bulges, and whether they are
consistent with global scaling relations of bulges and discs. We perform N-body
models of the accretion of satellites onto disc galaxies. A Tully-Fisher (M
\propto V_{rot}^ {alpha_TF}) scaling between primary and satellite ensures that
density ratios, critical to the outcome of the accretion, are realistic. We
carry out a full structural, kinematic and dynamical analysis of the evolution
of the bulge mass, bulge central concentration, and bulge-to-disc scaling
relations. The remnants of the accretion have bulge-disc structure. Both the
bulge-to-disc ratio (B/D) and the Sersic index (n) of the remnant bulge
increase as a result of the accretion, with moderate final bulge Sersic
indices: n = 1.0 to 1.9. Bulge growth occurs no matter the fate of the
secondary, which fully disrupts for alpha_TF=3 and partially survives to the
remnant center for alpha_TF = 3.5 or 4. Global structural parameters evolve
following trends similar to observations. We show that the dominant mechanism
for bulge growth is the inward flow of material from the disc to the bulge
region during the satellite decay. The models confirm that the growth of the
bulge out of disc material, a central ingredient of secular evolution models,
may be triggered externally through satellite accretion.",2006-06-30T12:27:04Z
Computing secular motion under slowly rotating quadratic perturbation,"We consider secular perturbations of nearly Keplerian two-body motion under a
perturbing potential that can be approximated to sufficient accuracy by
expanding it to second order in the coordinates. After averaging over time to
obtain the secular Hamiltonian, we use angular momentum and eccentricity
vectors as elements. The method of variation of constants then leads to a set
of equations of motion that are simple and regular, thus allowing efficient
numerical integration. Some possible applications are briefly described.",2006-06-09T08:03:40Z
"The luminosities, sizes and velocity dispersions of Brightest Cluster
  Galaxies: Implications for formation history","The size-luminosity relation of early-type Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs),
R_e ~ L^0.88, is steeper than that for the bulk of the early-type galaxy
population, for which R_e ~ L^0.68. In addition, although BCGs are hardly
offset from the Fundamental Plane defined by the bulk of the early-type
population, they show considerably smaller scatter. The larger than expected
sizes of BCGs, and the increased homogeneity, are qualitatively consistent with
models which seek to explain the colors of the most massive galaxies by
invoking dry dissipationless mergers, since dissipation tends to reduce the
sizes of galaxies, and wet mergers which result in star formation would tend to
increase the scatter in luminosity at fixed size and velocity dispersion.
Furthermore, BCGs define the same g-r color-magnitude relation as the bulk of
the early-type population. If BCGs formed from dry mergers, then BCG
progenitors must have been red for their magnitudes, suggesting that they
hosted older stellar populations than typical for their luminosities. Our
findings have two other consequences. First, the R_e-L relation of the
early-type galaxy population as a whole (i.e., normal plus BCG) exhibits some
curvature. Some of this curvature must be a consequence of the fact that an
increasing fraction of the most luminous galaxies are BCGs. The second
consequence is suggested by the fact that, despite following a steeper
size-luminosity relation, BCGs tend to define a tight relation between
dynamical mass R_e sigma^2/G and luminosity. As consequence, we find that BCGs
define a shallower sigma-L relation than the bulk of the early-type galaxy
population.",2006-07-07T16:05:31Z
New Planerary Nebulae towards the Galactic bulge,"New Planetary Nebulae (PNe) were discovered through an [O III] 5007 A
emission line survey in the Galactic bulge region with l>0 deg. We detected 240
objects, including 44 new PNe. Deep Halpha+[N II] CCD images as well as low
resolution spectra were obtained for the new PNe in order to study them in
detail. Preliminary photo-ionization models of the new PNe with Cloudy resulted
in first estimates of the physical parameters and abundances. They are compared
to the abundances of Galactic PNe.",2006-05-03T08:35:58Z
"Features in Dark Energy Equation of State and Modulations in the Hubble
  Diagram","We probe the time dependence of the dark energy equation of state (EOS) in
light of three-year WMAP (WMAP3) and the combination with other tentative
cosmological observations from galaxy clustering (SDSS) and Type Ia Supernova
(SNIa). We mainly focus on cases where the EOS is oscillating or with local
bumps. By performing a global analysis with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
method, we find the current observations, in particular the WMAP3 + SDSS data
combination, allow large oscillations of the EOS which can leave oscillating
features on the (residual) Hubble diagram, and such oscillations are
potentially detectable by future observations like SNAP, or even by the
CURRENTLY ONGOING SNIa observations. Local bumps of dark energy EOS can also
leave imprints on CMB, LSS and SNIa. In cases where the bumps take place at low
redshifts and the effective EOS are close to -1, CMB and LSS observations
cannot give constraints on such possibilities. However, geometrical
observations like (future) SNIa can possibly detect such features. On the other
hand when the local bumps take place at higher redshifts beyond the
detectability of SNIa, future precise observations like Gamma-ray bursts, CMB
and LSS may possibly detect such features. In particular, we find that
bump-like dark energy EOS on high redshifts might be responsible for the
features of WMAP on ranges l \sim 30-50, which is interesting and deserves
addressing further.",2006-05-15T17:42:09Z
The star formation history of luminous infrared galaxies,"We constrain the past star formation histories of a sample of 25 distant
(z~0.7) luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) detected with the mid infrared
cameras ISOCAM and MIPS onboard the ISO and Spitzer satellites.
  We use high resolution VLT-FORS2 spectroscopy in addition to a comprehensive
library of 200,000 model optical spectra to derive Bayesian likelihood
estimates of the star formation histories of these galaxies based on the
analysis of Balmer absorption lines and the 4000 A break.
  The locus of distant LIRGs in the diagram defined by Hdelta_A and D4000 is
roughly comparable to that of local LIRGs observed with IRAS, suggesting that
no trend for an evolution is detected between the local and distant LIRGs. We
obtain similar results when using either the H8 or the H$\delta_A$ Balmer
absorption-line indices in combination with D4000.
  We compute a birthrate parameter (b=SFR/<SFR>) of 4\pm1, confirming that the
distant LIRGs are currently experiencing a major phase of star formation. The
most likely duration of the bursts is 0.10 Gyr, during which the LIRGs produce
5-10 % of their current stellar mass. No evidence is found for successive
starbursts on the scale of a few times $10^7$ yr, such as those predicted by
some numerical simulations of major mergers. However, the large number density
of those galaxies suggest that they could experience between two and four LIRG
phases until the present epoch.",2006-05-25T16:24:25Z

The Evidence for a Binary origin of the Young Planetary Nebula HB 12,"The young planetary nebulae play an important role in stellar evolution when
intermediate- to low-mass stars (0.8 $\sim$ 8 M$_\odot$) evolve from the
proto-planetary nebulae phase to the planetary nebulae phase. Many young
planetary nebulae display distinct bipolar structures as they evolve away from
the proto-planetary nebulae phase. One possible cause of their bipolarity could
be due to a binary origin of its energy source. Here we report our detailed
investigation of the young planetary nebula, Hubble 12, which is well-known for
its extended hourglass-like envelope. We present evidence with time-series
photometric observations the existence of an eclipsing binary at the center of
Hubble 12. Low-resolution spectra of the central source show, on the other
hand, absorption features such as CN, G-band & Mg b${\arcsec}$, which can be
suggestive of a low-mass nature of the secondary component.",2006-03-09T06:52:39Z
Bayesian foreground analysis with CMB data,"The quality of CMB observations has improved dramatically in the last few
years, and will continue to do so in the coming decade. Over a wide range of
angular scales, the uncertainty due to instrumental noise is now small compared
to the cosmic variance. One may claim with some justification that we have
entered the era of precision CMB cosmology. However, some caution is still
warranted: The errors due to residual foreground contamination in the CMB power
spectrum and cosmological parameters remain largely unquantified, and the
effect of these errors on important cosmological parameters such as the optical
depth tau and spectral index n_s is not obvious. A major goal for current CMB
analysis efforts must therefore be to develop methods that allows us to
propagate such uncertainties from the raw data through to the final products.
Here we review a recently proposed method that may be a first step towards that
goal.",2006-04-07T13:27:14Z
Inhomogeneous Big Bang Nucleosynthesis Revisited,"We reanalyze the allowed parameters for inhomogeneous big bang
nucleosynthesis in light of the WMAP constraints on the baryon-to-photon ratio
and a recent measurement which has set the neutron lifetime to be 878.5 +/- 0.7
+/- 0.3 seconds. For a set baryon-to-photon ratio the new lifetime reduces the
mass fraction of He4 by 0.0015 but does not significantly change the abundances
of other isotopes. This enlarges the region of concordance between He4 and
deuterium in the parameter space of the baryon-to-photon ratio and the IBBN
distance scale. The Li7 abundance can be brought into concordance with observed
He4 and deuterium abundances by using depletion factors as high as 9.3. The
WMAP constraints, however, severely limit the allowed comoving (T = 100 GK)
inhomogeneity distance scale to (1.3 - 2.6)x10^5 cm.",2006-03-30T20:24:44Z
"A Quasi-Periodic Modulation of the Radio Light Curve of the Blazar PKS
  B0048-097","In this letter we present the results of a wavelet analysis of the radio
light curve of the BL Lac Object PKS B0048-097 from the University of Michigan
Radio Astronomy Observatory monitoring program at 8GHz during twenty-five
years, from 1979 to 2004. The results show a remarkable periodicity of 450-470
days in the early 1980s that changed to a ~585 day periodicity in the late
1980s to early 1990s. A less pronounced ~400 day periodicity is found after
\~1995. Very-long-baseline interferometry imaging at 15GHz shows dramatic
structural changes in the usually unresolved source between two epochs, 1995.57
and 2002.38. The pronounced northward directed jet seen in the 2002 image
differs by more than 90 degrees in direction from the source structure found in
earlier epochs. These findings make PKS B0048-097 a primary target for
multi-wavelength observations and intensive radio monitoring to decipher the

Observing IMBH-IMBH Binary Coalescences via Gravitational Radiation,"Recent numerical simulations have suggested the possibility of forming double
intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) via the collisional runaway scenario in
young dense star clusters. The two IMBHs formed would exchange into a common
binary shortly after their birth, and quickly inspiral and merge. Since
space-borne gravitational wave (GW) observatories such as LISA will be able to
see the late phases of their inspiral out to several Gpc, and LIGO will be able
to see the merger and ringdown out to similar distances, they represent
potentially significant GW sources. In this Letter we estimate the rate at
which LISA and LIGO will see their inspiral and merger in young star clusters,
and discuss the information that can be extracted from the observations. We
find that LISA will likely see tens of IMBH--IMBH inspirals per year, while
advanced LIGO could see ~10 merger and ringdown events per year, with both
rates strongly dependent on the distribution of cluster masses and densities.",2006-05-30T23:57:47Z
"Globular Clusters at the Centre of the Fornax Cluster: Tracing

the globular cluster system (GCS) around NGC 1399, the central galaxy of the
Fornax cluster, and a study of the GCSs around NGC 1374, NGC 1379 and NGC 1387,
three low-luminosity early-type galaxies located close to the centre of the
same cluster. In both cases, the data consist of images from the wide-field
MOSAIC Imager of the CTIO 4-m telescope, obtained with Washington C and
Kron-Cousins R filters, which provide good metallicity resolution. The colour
distributions and radial projected densities of the GCSs are analyzed. We focus
on the properties of the GCSs that trace possible interaction processes between
the galaxies, such as tidal stripping of globular clusters. For the blue
globular clusters, we find tails between NGC 1399 and neighbouring galaxies in
the azimuthal projected distribution, and the three low-luminosity galaxies
show low specific frequencies and a low proportion of blue GCs.",2006-05-02T18:48:10Z
The Origin of Primordial Magnetic Fields,"(abridged) We suggest here that the large scale fields $\sim \mu$G, observed
in galaxies at both high and low redshifts by Faraday Rotation Measurements
(FRMs), have their origin in the electromagnetic fluctuations that naturally
occurred in the dense hot plasma that existed just after the QHPT. We evolve
the predicted fields to the present time. The size of the region containing a
coherent magnetic field increased due to the fusion (polymerization) of smaller
regions. Magnetic fields (MFs) $\sim 10 \mu G$ over a comoving $\sim 1$ pc
region are predicted at redshift z $\sim 10$. These fields are orders of
magnitude greater than those predicted in previous scenarios for creating
primordial magnetic fields. Line-of-sight average magnetic fields (MFs) $\sim$
$10^{-2}$ $\mu$G, valid for FRMs, are obtained over a 1 Mpc comoving region at
the redshift z $\sim$ 10.
  In the collapse to a galaxy (comoving size $\sim$ 30 kpc) at z $\sim$ 10, the
fields are amplified to $\sim 10 \mu$G. This indicates that the MFs created
immediately after the QHPT, predicted by the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem,
could be the origin of the $\sim \mu G$ fields observed by FRMs in galaxies at
both high and low redshifts.",2006-07-10T18:44:07Z
"A Survey of O VI, C III, and H I in Highly Ionized High-Velocity Clouds","(ABRIDGED) We present a Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer survey of
highly ionized high-velocity clouds (HVCs) in 66 extragalactic sight lines. We
find a total of 63 high-velocity O VI absorbers, 16 with 21 cm-emitting H I
counterparts and 47 ``highly ionized'' absorbers without 21 cm emission. 11 of
these high-velocity O VI absorbers are positive-velocity wings (broad O VI
features extending asymmetrically to velocities of up to 300 km/s). The highly
ionized HVC population is characterized by <b(O VI)>=38+/-10 km/s and <log
N_a(O VI)>=13.83+/-0.36. We find that 81% (30/37) of high-velocity O VI
absorbers have clear accompanying C III absorption, and 76% (29/38) have
accompanying H I absorption in the Lyman series. The lower average width of the
high-velocity H I absorbers implies the H I lines arise in a separate, lower
temperature phase than the O VI. We find that the shape of the wing profiles is
well reproduced by a radiatively cooling, vertical outflow. However, the
outflow has to be patchy and out of ionization equilibrium. An alternative
model, consistent with the observations, is one where the highly ionized HVCs
represent the low N(H I) tail of the HVC population, with the O VI formed at
the interfaces around the embedded H I cores. Though we cannot rule out a Local
Group explanation, we favor a Galactic origin. This is based on the recent
evidence that both H I HVCs and the million-degree gas detected in X-ray
absorption are Galactic phenomena. Since the highly ionized HVCs appear to
trace the interface between these two Galactic phases, it follows that highly
ionized HVCs are Galactic themselves. However, the non-detection of
high-velocity O VI in halo star spectra implies that any Galactic high-velocity
O VI exists at z-distances beyond a few kpc.",2006-04-05T15:46:57Z
"Einstein and Jordan frames reconciled: a frame-invariant approach to
  scalar-tensor cosmology","Scalar-Tensor theories of gravity can be formulated in different frames, most
notably, the Einstein and the Jordan one. While some debate still persists in
the literature on the physical status of the different frames, a frame
transformation in Scalar-Tensor theories amounts to a local redefinition of the
metric, and then should not affect physical results. We analyze the issue in a
cosmological context. In particular, we define all the relevant observables
(redshift, distances, cross-sections, ...) in terms of frame-independent
quantities. Then, we give a frame-independent formulation of the Boltzmann
equation, and outline its use in relevant examples such as particle freeze-out
and the evolution of the CMB photon distribution function. Finally, we derive
the gravitational equations for the frame-independent quantities at first order
in perturbation theory. From a practical point of view, the present approach
allows the simultaneous implementation of the good aspects of the two frames in
a clear and straightforward way.",2006-04-24T14:52:31Z
"Number counts and clustering properties of bright Distant Red Galaxies
  in the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey Early Data Release","We describe the number counts and spatial distribution of 239 Distant Red
Galaxies (DRGs), selected from the Early Data Release of the UKIDSS Ultra Deep
Survey. The DRGs are identified by their very red infrared colours with
(J-K)AB>1.3, selected over 0.62 sq degree to a 90% completeness limit of
KAB~20.7. This is the first time a large sample of bright DRGs has been studied
within a contiguous area, and we provide the first measurements of their number
counts and clustering. The population shows strong angular clustering,
intermediate between those of K-selected field galaxies and
optical/infrared-selected Extremely Red Galaxies. Adopting the redshift
distributions determined from other recent studies, we infer a high correlation
length of r0~11 h-1 Mpc. Such strong clustering could imply that our galaxies
are hosted by very massive dark matter halos, consistent with the progenitors
of present-day L>L* elliptical galaxies.",2006-06-15T18:59:23Z
"Diffuse Light in Hickson Compact Groups: The Dynamically Young System
  HCG 44","Compact groups are associations of a few galaxies in which the environment
plays an important role in galaxy evolution. The low group velocity dispersion
favors tidal interactions and mergers, which may bring stars from galaxies to
the diffuse intragroup light. Numerical simulations of galaxy clusters in
hierarchical cosmologies show that the amount of the diffuse light increases
with the dynamical evolution of the cluster. We search for diffuse light in the
galaxy group HCG 44 in order to determine its luminosity and luminosity
fraction. Combining with literature data, we aim to constrain the dynamical
status of Hickson compact groups. We use Intra Group planetary nebulae (IGPNe)
as tracers of diffuse light. These are detected by the so-called on band-off
band technique. We found 12 emission line objects in HCG 44, none of them
associated with the galaxies of the group. 6/12 emission line objects are
consistent with being IGPNe in HCG 44, but are also consistent with being
Ly$\alpha$ background galaxies. Thus we derive an upper limit to the diffuse
light fraction in HCG 44 of 4.7%. We find a correlation between the fraction of
elliptical galaxies and the amount of diffuse light in Hickson compact groups.
Those with large fraction of diffuse light are those with large fractions in
number and luminosity of E/S0 galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for
Hickson compact groups in which the amount of diffuse light increases with the
dynamical evolution of the group.",2006-07-12T17:22:13Z
Polarimetric survey of asteroids with the Asiago telescope,"We present the first results of an asteroid photo--polarimetry program
started at Asiago--Cima Ekar Observatory. The aim of our survey is to estimate
diversity in polarimetric properties of asteroids belonging to different

analyser placed inside the Faint Object Spectrographic Camera (AFOSC) of the
1.8m telescope. This instrument allows simultaneous measurements of the two
first Stokes parameters without any lambda/2 retarding plate. Our survey began
in 2002, and up to now we have obtained data on a sample of 36 asteroids; most
of them are being investigated with the polarimetric technique for the first
time. Combining our data with those already available in literature, we present
an estimate of the inversion angle for 7 asteroids in this paper. Furthermore,

On the Origin of HD149026b,"The high density of the close-in extrasolar planet HD149026b suggests the
presence of a huge core in the planet, which challenges planet formation
theory. We first derive constraints on the amount of heavy elements and
hydrogen/helium present in the planet: We find that preferred values of the
core mass are between 50 and 80 M_E. We then investigate the possibility of
subcritical core accretion as envisioned for Uranus and Neptune and find that
the subcritical accretion scenario is unlikely in the case of HD149026b for at
least two reasons: (i) Subcritical planets are such that the ratio of their
core mass to their total mass is above ~0.7, in contradiction with constraints
for all but the most extreme interior models of HD149026b; (ii) High accretion
rates and large isolation mass required for the formation of a subcritical core
of 30 M_E are possible only at specific orbital distances in a disk with a
surface density of dust equal to at least 10 times that of the minimum mass
solar nebula. This value climbs to 30 when considering a 50 M_E core. These
facts point toward two main routes for the formation of this planet: (i) Gas
accretion that is limited by a slow viscous inflow of gas in an evaporating
disk; (ii) A significant modification of the composition of the planet after as
accretion has stopped. These two routes are not mutually exclusive.
Illustrating the second route, we show that for a wide range of impact
parameters, giant impacts lead to a loss of the gas component of the planet and
thus may lead to planets that are highly enriched in heavy elements. In the
giant impact scenario, we expect an outer giant planet to be present.
Observational studies by imaging, astrometry and long term interferometry of
this system are needed to better narrow down the ensemble of possibilities.",2006-07-11T02:59:14Z
"Accretion, feedback and galaxy bimodality: a comparison of the GalICS
  semi-analytic model and cosmological SPH simulations","We compare the galaxy population of an SPH simulation to those predicted by
the GalICS semi-analytic model and a stripped down version without supernova
and AGN feedback. The SPH simulation and the no-feedback GalICS model make
similar predictions for the baryonic mass functions of galaxies and for the
dependence of these mass functions on environment and redshift. The two methods
also make similar predictions for the galaxy content of dark matter haloes as a
function of halo mass and for the gas accretion history of galaxies. Both the
SPH and no-feedback GalICS models predict a bimodal galaxy population at z=0.
The ""red'' sequence of gas poor, old galaxies is populated mainly by satellite
systems while, contrary to observations, the central galaxies of massive haloes
lie on the ""blue'' star-forming sequence as a result of continuing hot gas
accretion at late times. Furthermore, both models overpredict the observed
baryonic mass function, especially at the high mass end. In the full GalICS
model, supernova-driven outflows reduce the masses of low and intermediate mass
galaxies by about a factor of two. AGN feedback suppresses gas cooling in large
haloes, producing a sharp cut-off in the baryonic mass function and moving the
central galaxies of these massive haloes to the red sequence. Our results imply
that the observational failings of the SPH simulation and the no-feedback
GalICS model are a consequence of missing input physics rather than
computational inaccuracies, that truncating gas accretion by satellite galaxies
automatically produces a bimodal galaxy distribution with a red sequence, but
that explaining the red colours of the most massive galaxies requires a
mechanism like AGN feedback that suppresses the accretion onto central galaxies
in large haloes.",2006-05-31T18:09:52Z
"Synchrotron emission in small scale magnetic field as possible
  explanation for prompt emission spectra of gamma-ray bursts","Synchrotron emission is believed to be a major radiation mechanism during
gamma-ray bursts' (GRBs) prompt emission phase. A significant drawback of this
assumption is that the theoretical predicted spectrum, calculated within the
framework of the ``internal shocks'' scenario using the standard assumption
that the magnetic field maintains a steady value throughout the shocked region,
leads to a slope F_\nu \propto \nu^{-1/2} below 100 keV, which is in
contradiction to the much harder spectra observed. This is due to the electrons
cooling time being much shorter than the dynamical time. In order to overcome
this problem, we propose here that the magnetic field created by the internal
shocks decays on a length scale much shorter than the comoving width of the
plasma. We show that under this assumption synchrotron radiation can reproduce
the observed prompt emission spectra of the majority of the bursts. We
calculate the required decay length of the magnetic field, and find it to be
\~10^4 - 10^5 cm (equivalent to 10^5 - 10^6 skin depths), much shorter than the
characteristic comoving width of the plasma, ~3*10^{9} cm. We implement our
model to the case of GRB050820A, where a break at <~ 4 keV was observed, and
show that this break can be explained by synchrotron self absorption. We
discuss the consequences of the small scale magnetic field scenario on current
models of magnetic field generation in shock waves.",2006-05-24T21:11:21Z
"Searching for a gigamaser in APM08279+5255, and other short stories","Bolometer arrays on large antennas at high, dry sites have unveiled a dusty
population of massive, luminous galaxies - submillimetre galaxies, or SMGs -
which make a significant contribution to the star-formation rate density at z >
1. The most crucial piece of information required to derive the history of
obscured star formation is the redshift distribution of this galaxy population,
N(z), which breaks degeneracies in the models and allows the mass and dynamics
of the galaxies to be explored via high-resolution three-dimensional imaging in
CO and by determining their level of clustering. Many SMGs are extremely faint,
optically; some have no plausible counterparts, even in the IR, making the
determination of an unbiased N(z) very difficult. The arrival of Herschel and
next-generation ground-based submm cameras will likely exacerbate this
so-called `redshift deadlock'. Here, we report the first test of a new method
for determining redshifts, based on the observed dependence of maser and IR
luminosities. We have searched the dusty, lensed, hyperluminous quasar,
APM08279+5255, for the 1612-, 1665- and 1667-MHz hydroxyl lines as well as the
22-GHz water line. At z = 3.9 these are shifted to 329, 340 and 4,538MHz. Our
relatively shallow test data reveal no convincing maser activity but we set a
meaningful constraint on the OH maser luminosity and we approach the expected
thermal noise levels, meaning progress is possible. As an aside, we present
deep new submm and radio imaging of this field. Using a simple shift-and-add
technique we uncover a new submm galaxy, conceivably at the redshift of
APM08279+5255.",2006-03-28T11:32:49Z
"A Likelihood Method for Measuring the Ultrahigh Energy Cosmic Ray
  Composition","Air fluorescence detectors traditionally determine the dominant chemical
composit ion of the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray flux by comparing the averaged
slant depth of the shower maximum, $X_{max}$, as a function of energy to the
slant depths expect ed for various hypothesized primaries. In this paper, we
present a method to make a direct measurement of the expected mean number of
protons and iron by comparing the shap es of the expected $X_{max}$
distributions to the distribution for data. The advantages of this method
includes the use of information of the full distribution and its ability to
calculate a flux for various cosmic ray compositi ons. The same method can be
expanded to marginalize uncertainties due to choice of spectra, hadronic models
and atmospheric parameters. We demonstrate the technique with independent
simulated data samples from a parent sample of protons and iron. We accurately
predict the number of protons and iron in the parent sample and show that the
uncertainties are meaningful.",2006-04-27T03:59:43Z
R Coronae Borealis at the 2003 Light Minimum,"High-resolution optical spectra of R CrB obtained in 2003 March is discussed.
The 2003 spectra are compared with the extensive collection of spectra from the
1995-1996 minimum. Spectroscopic features common to the two minima include
sharp emission lines of neutral and singly-ionized atoms, broad emission lines
including He {\sc i}, [N {\sc ii}] 6583 \AA, Na D, and Ca {\sc ii} H & K lines,
and blueshifted aborption lines of Na D, and K {\sc i} resonance lines.
Prominent differences between the 2003 and 1995-96 spectra are seen. The 2003
profiles of Na D, Ca II H & K are fit by a single Gaussian but in 1995-1996 two
Gaussians separated by about 200 km s$^{-1}$ were required. However, the He
{\sc i} broad emission lines are fit by a single Gaussian at all times; the
emitting He and Na-Ca atoms are probably not colocated. The C$_2$ Phillips 2-0
lines are detected as sharp absorption lines in 2003 indicating presence of gas
at 1300 K.The 2003 spectra show C {\sc i} sharp emission lines at minimum light
with a velocity changing in five days by about 20 km s$^{-1}$ when the velocity
of `metal' sharp lines is unchanged; the C {\sc i} emission may arise from
shock-heated gas. Spectra at maximum shows extended blue wings to strong lines
with the extension dependent on a line's lower excitation potential a signature
of stellar wind. Changes in the cores of the resonance lines of Al {\sc i} and
Na D and the Ca {\sc ii} IR lines suggest complex flow patterns near the
photosphere. The spectroscopic differences at the two mimima show the
importance of continued scrutiny of the declines of R CrB.",2006-05-09T07:23:47Z
Off-axis emission from relativistic plasma flows,"We show that there is no universal law describing how the spectra and
luminosity of synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation from relativistic jets
change with increasing observation angle. Instead, the physics of particle
acceleration leaves pronounced imprints in the observed spectra and allows for
a freedom in numerous modifications of them. The impact of these effects is the
largest for high-energy radiation and depends on the details of particle
acceleration mechanism(s), what can be used to discriminate between different
models. Generally, the beam patterns of relativistic jets in GeV-TeV spectral
domain are much wider than the inverse Lorentz factor. The off-axis emission in
this energy range appear to be brighter, have much harder spectra and a much
higher cut-off frequency compared to the values derived from Doppler boosting
considerations alone.
  The implications include the possibility to explain high-latitude
unidentified EGRET sources as off-axis but otherwise typical relativistic-jet
sources, such as blazars, and the prediction of GeV-TeV afterglow from
transient jet sources, such as Gamma-Ray Bursts. We also discuss the phenomenon
of beam-pattern broadening in application to neutrino emission.",2006-05-18T15:24:08Z
"Search for Compact Extragalactic Radio Sources Near Massive Star Forming
  Regions","We have used the Very Large Array to search for compact milliarcsecond-size
radio sources near methanol masers in high-mass star-forming regions. Such
sources are required for Very Long Baseline Interferometry phase-referencing
observations. We conducted pointed observations of 234 compact sources found in
the NVSS survey and find 92 sources with unresolved components and synchrotron
spectral indexes. These sources are likely the cores of AGNs and, thus, good
candidates for astrometric calibrators.",2006-06-16T08:39:50Z
"Supernovae and Radio Galaxies Probing Gurzadyan-Xue Cosmological Models
  with Dark Energy","In the previous papers we derived cosmological equations for models with
Gurzadyan-Xue dark energy, have performed their qualitative analysis and,
particularly, have revealed a remarkable hidden invariance in the models with
respect to the separatrix $\Omega_{sep}$ in their phase portraits. Now, new
analytic solutions for these models are obtained, showing additional symmetries
at various curvatures. The likelihood analysis with supernovae and radio
galaxies data and their characteristics (age, the deceleration parameter),
again demonstrate the crucial role of the $\Omega_{sep}$ for all models, in
spite of the diversity of both, the initial equations and their solutions.",2006-04-27T12:58:36Z
Matched Filters for Source Detection in the Poissonian Noise Regime,"A procedure is described for estimating an optimum kernel for the detection
by convolution of signals among Poissonian noise. The technique is applied to
the detection of x-ray point sources in XMM-Newton data, and is shown to yield
an improvement in detection sensitivity of up to 60% over the sliding-box
method used in the creation of the 1XMM catalog.",2006-03-14T17:47:32Z
"The N/O Plateau of Blue Compact Galaxies: Monte Carlo Simulations of the
  Observed Scatter","Chemical evolution models and Monte Carlo simulation techniques have been
combined for the first time to study the distribution of blue compact galaxies
on the N/O plateau. Each simulation comprises 70 individual chemical evolution
models. For each model, input parameters relating to a galaxy's star formation
history (bursting or continuous star formation, star formation efficiency),
galaxy age, and outflow rate are chosen randomly from ranges predetermined to
be relevant. Predicted abundance ratios from each simulation are collectively
overplotted onto the data to test its viability. We present our results both
with and without observational scatter applied to the model points. Our study
shows that most trial combinations of input parameters, including a simulation
comprising only simple models with instantaneous recycling, are successful in
reproducing the observed morphology of the N/O plateau once observational
scatter is added. Therefore simulations which include delay of nitrogen
injection are no longer favored over those which propose that most nitrogen is
produced by massive stars, if only the plateau morphology is used as the
principal constraint. The one scenario which clearly cannot explain plateau
morphology is one in which galaxy ages are allowed to range below 250 Myr. We
conclude that the present data for the N/O plateau are insufficient by
themselves for identifying the portion of the stellar mass spectrum most
responsible for cosmic nitrogen production.",2006-05-10T17:13:00Z
"The Detailed Star Formation History in the Spheroid, Outer Disk, and
  Tidal Stream of the Andromeda Galaxy","Using the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope, we have
obtained deep optical images reaching stars well below the oldest main sequence
turnoff in the spheroid, tidal stream, and outer disk of the Andromeda Galaxy.
We have reconstructed the star formation history in these fields by comparing
their color-magnitude diagrams to a grid of isochrones calibrated to Galactic
globular clusters observed in the same bands. Each field exhibits an extended
star formation history, with many stars younger than 10 Gyr but few younger
than 4 Gyr. Considered together, the star counts, kinematics, and population
characteristics of the spheroid argue against some explanations for its
intermediate-age, metal-rich population, such as a significant contribution
from stars residing in the disk or a chance intersection with the stream's
orbit. Instead, it is likely that this population is intrinsic to the inner
spheroid, whose highly-disturbed structure is clearly distinct from the
pressure-supported metal-poor halo that dominates farther from the galaxy's
center. The stream and spheroid populations are similar, but not identical,
with the stream's mean age being ~1 Gyr younger; this similarity suggests that
the inner spheroid is largely polluted by material stripped from either the
stream's progenitor or similar objects. The disk population is considerably
younger and more metal-rich than the stream and spheroid populations, but not
as young as the thin disk population of the solar neighborhood; instead, the
outer disk of Andromeda is dominated by stars of age 4 - 8 Gyr, resembling the
Milky Way's thick disk. The disk data are inconsistent with a population
dominated by ages older than 10 Gyr, and in fact do not require any stars older
than 10 Gyr.",2006-07-28T04:04:15Z
The dust envelope of the pre-planetary nebula IRAS19475+3119,"We present the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the pre-planetary
nebula, IRAS 19475+3119 (I19475), from the optical to the far-infrared. We
identify emission features due to crystalline silicates in the ISO SWS spectra
of the star. We have fitted the SED of I19475 using a 1-D radiative transfer
code, and find that a shell with inner and outer radii of 8.8X10^{16} and
4.4X10^{17}cm, and dust temperatures ranging from about 94K to 46K provide the
best fit. The mass of this shell is greater than/equal to
1[34cm^{2}g^{-1}/kappa(100micron)][delta/200]M_Sun, where kappa(100micron) is
the 100micron dust mass absorption coefficient (per unit dust mass), and delta
is the gas-to-dust ratio. In agreement with results from optical imaging and
millimeter-wave observations of CO emission of I19475, our model fits support
an r^{-3} density law for its dust shell, with important implications for the
interaction process between the fast collimated post-AGB winds and the dense
AGB envelopes which results in the observed shapes of PPNs and PNs. We find
that the observed JCMT flux at sub-millimeter wavelengths (850micron) is a
factor ~ 2 larger than our model flux, suggesting the presence of large dust
grains in the dust shell of I19475 which are not accounted for by our adopted
standard MRN grain size distribution.",2006-03-07T13:33:53Z
A Curious New Milky Way Satellite in Ursa Major,"In this Letter, we study a localized stellar overdensity in the constellation
of Ursa Major, first identified in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data and
subsequently followed up with Subaru imaging. Its color-magnitude diagram (CMD)
shows a well-defined sub-giant branch, main sequence and turn-off, from which
we estimate a distance of ~30 kpc and a projected size of ~250 x 125 pc. The
CMD suggests a composite population with some range in metallicity and/or age.
Based on its extent and stellar population, we argue that this is a previously
unknown satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, hereby named Ursa Major II (UMa II)
after its constellation. Using SDSS data, we find an absolute magnitude of M_V
\~ -3.8, which would make it the faintest known satellite galaxy. UMa II's
isophotes are irregular and distorted with evidence for multiple
concentrations; this suggests that the satellite is in the process of
disruption.",2006-06-26T19:34:56Z
"Chemical abundances for the transiting planet host stars OGLE-TR-10, 56,
  111, 113, 132 and TrES-1. Abundances in different galactic populations","We used the UVES spectrograph (VLT-UT2 telescope) to obtain high-resolution
spectra of 6 stars hosting transiting planets, namely for OGLE-TR-10, 56, 111,
113, 132 and TrES-1. The spectra are now used to derive and discuss the
chemical abundances for C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni,
Cu and Zn. Abundances were derived in LTE, using 1-D plane-parallel Kurucz
model atmospheres. For S, Zn and Cu we used a spectral synthesis procedure,
while for the remaining cases the abundances were derived from measurements of
line-equivalent widths. The resulting abundances are compared with those found
for stars in the solar neighborhood. Distances and galactic coordinates are
estimated for the stars. We conclude that besides being particularly
metal-rich, with small possible exceptions OGLE-TR-10, 56, 111, 113, 132 and
TrES-1 are chemically undistinguishable from the field (thin disk) stars
regarding their [X/Fe] abundances. This is particularly relevant for the most
distant of the targets, located at up to ~2 Kpc from the Sun. We also did not
find any correlation between the abundances and the condensation temperature of
the elements, an evidence that strong accretion of planetary-like material,
tentatively connected to planetary migration, did not occur.",2006-06-30T17:03:59Z
"Measuring proton energies and fluxes using EIT (SOHO) CCD areas outside
  the solar disk images","An indirect proton flux measuring tool based on discrimination of the energy
deposited by protons in 128 x 128 pixel EIT CCD areas outside the solar disk
images is presented. Single pixel intensity events are converted into proton
incident energy flux using modeled energy deposition curves for angles of
incidence 60 deg in four EIT spatial areas with different proton stopping
power. The extracted proton flux is corrected for both the loss of one-pixel
events in the range of angles of incidence as well as for the contribution to
the single pixel events resulting from scattered middle-energy protons
(low-energy or high-energy particles are stopped by the EIT components or pass
through them, accordingly). A simple geometrical approach was found and applied
to correct for a non-unique relation between the proton-associated CCD output
signal and the incident proton energy. With this geometrical approximation four
unique proton incident energy ranges were determined as 45--49, 145--154,
297--335, and 390--440 MeV. The indirect proton flux measuring tool has been
tested by comparing Solar Energetic Particles (SEP) flux temporal profiles
extracted from the EIT CCD frames and downloaded from the GOES database for the
Bastille Day (BD) of 2000 July 14 and the more recent 2005 January 20 events.
The SEP flux temporal profiles and proton spectra extracted from the EIT in the
relatively narrow energy ranges between 45 and 440 MeV reported here are
consistent with the related GOES profiles. The four additional EIT extracted
ranges provide higher energy resolution of the SEP data.",2006-04-20T16:43:49Z
"The FSVS Cluster Catalogue: Galaxy Clusters and Groups in the Faint Sky
  Variability Survey","We describe a large sample of 598 galaxy clusters and rich groups discovered
in the data of the Faint Sky Variability Survey. The clusters have been
identified using a fully automated, semi-parametric technique based on a
maximum likelihood approach applied to Voronoi tessellation, and enhanced by
colour discrimination. The sample covers a wide range of richness, has a
density of ~28 clusters per sqdeg, and spans a range of estimated redshifts of
0.05 < z < 0.9 with mean <z> = 0.345. Assuming the presence of a cluster red
sequence, the uncertainty of the estimated cluster redshifts is assessed to be
\~0.03. Containing over 100 clusters with z > 0.6, the catalogue contributes
substantially to the current total of optically-selected, intermediate-redshift
clusters, and complements the existing, usually X-ray selected, samples. The
FSVS fields are accessible for observation throughout the whole year, making
them particularly suited for large follow-up programmes. The construction of
this FSVS Cluster Catalogue completes a fundamental component of our continuing
programmes to investigate the environments of quasars and the chemical
evolution of galaxies. We publish here the list of all clusters with their
basic parameters, and discuss some illustrative examples in more detail. The
full FSVS Cluster Catalogue, together with images and lists of member galaxies
etc., will be issued as part of the ``NOAO data products'', and accessible at
http://www.noao.edu/dpp/. We describe the format of these data and access to
them.",2006-04-28T13:59:00Z
Magnetic Field Seeding by Galactic Winds,"The origin of intergalactic magnetic fields is still a mystery and several
scenarios have been proposed so far: among them, primordial phase transitions,
structure formation shocks and galactic outflows. In this work we investigate
how efficiently galactic winds can provide an intense and widespread ""seed""
magnetisation. This may be used to explain the magnetic fields observed today
in clusters of galaxies and in the intergalactic medium (IGM). We use
semi-analytic simulations of magnetised galactic winds coupled to high
resolution N-body simulations of structure formation to estimate lower and
upper limits for the fraction of the IGM which can be magnetised up to a
specified level. We find that galactic winds are able to seed a substantial
fraction of the cosmic volume with magnetic fields. Most regions affected by
winds have magnetic fields in the range -12 < Log B < -8 G, while higher seed
fields can be obtained only rarely and in close proximity to wind-blowing
galaxies. These seed fields are sufficiently intense for a moderately efficient
turbulent dynamo to amplify them to the observed values. The volume filling
factor of the magnetised regions strongly depends on the efficiency of winds to
load mass from the ambient medium. However, winds never completely fill the
whole Universe and pristine gas can be found in cosmic voids and regions
unaffected by feedback even at z=0. This means that, in principle, there might
be the possibility to probe the existence of primordial magnetic fields in such
regions.",2006-04-21T10:48:52Z
"Supernova remnant energetics and magnetars: no evidence in favour of
  millisecond proto-neutron stars","It is generally accepted that Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs) and Soft
Gamma-ray Repeaters (SGRs) are magnetars, i.e. neutron stars with extremely
high surface magnetic fields ($B > 10^{14}$ G). The origin of these high
magnetic fields is uncertain, but a popular hypothesis is that magnetars are
born with an initial spin period not much exceeding the convective overturn
time (~3ms), which results in a powerful dynamo action, amplifying the seed
magnetic field to $> ~10^{15}$ G. Part of this rotation energy is then expected
to power the supernova through rapid magnetic braking. It is therefore possible
that magnetars creation is accompanied by supernovae that are an order of
magnitude more energetic than normal supernovae, provided their initial spin
period is ~1 ms. However, we list here evidence that the explosion energies of
these supernova remnants associated with AXPs and SGRs -- Kes 73 (AXP 1E
1841-045), CTB 109 (AXP 1E2259+586) and N49 (SGR 0526-66) -- are close to the
canonical supernova explosion energy of $10^{51}$~erg, suggesting an initial
spin period of > ~5ms.
  We therefore do not find evidence that magnetars are formed from rapidly
rotating proto-neutron stars, allowing for the possibility that they descend
from stellar progenitor with high magnetic field cores, and we discuss the
merits of both formation scenarios.
  In an appendix we describe the analysis of XMM-Newton observations of Kes 73
and N49 used to derive the explosion energies for these remnants.",2006-04-09T20:59:08Z
"Radio to TeV radiation initiated by termination of hadronic jets from
  microquasars in the ISM","Microquasars (MQs) are potential candidates to produce a non-negligible
fraction of the observed galactic cosmic rays. The protons accelerated at the
jet termination shock interact with the interstellar medium and may produce
extended emission detectable at different energy bands through several
processes: neutral pion-decay produce high-energy and very high-energy
gamma-rays, secondary electrons produced by charged pion-decay generate
synchrotron and bremsstrahlung emission. In addition, the jets of MQs
themselves are likely sources of gamma-rays. We discuss about the association
between the intrinsic and the indirect emission coming from these objects.",2006-05-19T11:11:25Z
"The Holmberg effect of Main galaxy pairs of the SDSS Data Release 4
  (SDSS4)","We have investigated the Holmberg effect of Main galaxy pairs of the SDSS
Data Release 4 (SDSS4). It is found that except i-z color the color indices
between the two components of Main galaxy pairs clearly have significantly
larger correlation coefficients. Further analyses also show that the Holmberg
Effect of galaxies not only depends on the color indices but also on the
morphological type for two components of pairs.",2006-05-12T23:33:27Z
TeV lightcurve of PSR B1259-63/SS2883,"The inverse Compton scattering of ultrarelativistic electrons accelerated at
the pulsar wind termination shock is believed to be responsible for TeV
gamma-ray signal recently reported from the binary system PSR B1259-63/SS2883.
While this process can explain the energy spectrum of the observed TeV
emission, the detected gamma-ray fluxes do not agree with the published
theoretical predictions of the TeV lightcurve. The main objective of this paper
is to show that the HESS results can be explained, under certain reasonable
assumptions, by inverse Compton scenarios of gamma-ray production in the
system. In this paper we study evolution of the energy spectra of relativistic
electrons under different assumptions about the acceleration and energy-loss
rates of electrons, and the impact of these processes on the lightcurve of IC
gamma-rays. We demonstrate that the observed TeV lightcurve can be explained
(i) by adiabatic losses which dominate over the entire trajectory of the pulsar
with a significant increase towards the periastron, or (ii) by the sub-TeV
cutoffs in the energy spectra of electrons due to the enhanced rate of Compton
losses close to the periastron. The Compton deceleration of the pulsar wind
contributes to the decrease of the nonthermal power released in the accelerated
electrons, and thus to the reduction of the IC and synchrotron components of
radiation close to the periastron. Although this effect alone cannot explain
the observed lightcurves, the Comptonization of the pulsar wind leads to the
formation of gamma-radiation with a line-type energy spectrum. While the HESS
data already constrain the Lorentz factor of the wind, $\Gamma \le 10^6$,
future observations of this object with GLAST should allow a deep probe of the
wind Lorentz factor in the range between $10^4$ and $10^6$.",2006-05-26T13:15:09Z
The evolutionary state of the southern dense core Cha-MMS1,"Aims: Our goal is to set constraints on the evolutionary state of the dense
core Cha-MMS1 in the Chamaeleon I molecular cloud. Methods: We analyze
molecular line observations carried out with the new submillimeter telescope
APEX. We look for outflow signatures around the dense core and probe its
chemical structure, which we compare to predictions of models of gas-phase
chemistry. We also use the public database of the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST)
to compare Cha-MMS1 with the two Class 0 protostars IRAM 04191 and L1521F,
which are at the same distance. Results: We measure a large deuterium
fractionation for N2H+ (11 +/- 3 %), intermediate between the prestellar core
L1544 and the very young Class 0 protostar L1521F. It is larger than for HCO+
(2.5 +/- 0.9 %), which is probably the result of depletion removing HCO+ from
the high-density inner region. Our CO(3-2) map reveals the presence of a
bipolar outflow driven by the Class I protostar Ced 110 IRS 4 but we do not
find evidence for an outflow powered by Cha-MMS1. We also report the detection
of Cha-MMS1 at 24, 70 and 160 microns by the instrument MIPS of the SST, at a
level nearly an order of magnitude lower than IRAM 04191 and L1521F.
Conclusions: Cha-MMS1 appears to have already formed a compact object, either
the first hydrostatic core at the very end of the prestellar phase, or an
extremely young protostar that has not yet powered any outflow, at the very
beginning of the Class 0 accretion phase.",2006-05-18T14:04:54Z
Extinction techniques and impact on dust property determination,"The near infrared extinction powerlaw index ($\beta$) and its uncertainty is
derived from three different techniques based on star counts, colour excess and
a combination of them. We have applied these methods to 2MASS data to determine
maps of $\beta$ and near infrared extinction of the small cloud IC 1396 W. The
combination of star counts and colour excess results in the most reliable
method to determine $\beta$. It is found that the use of the correct
$\beta$-map to transform colour excess values into extinction is fundamental
for column density profile analysis of clouds. We describe how artificial
photometric data, based on the model of stellar population synthesis of the
Galaxy (Robin et al. 2003), can be used to estimate uncertainties and derive
systematic effects of the extinction methods presented here. We find that all
colour excess based extinction determination methods are subject to small but
systematic offsets, which do not affect the star counting technique. These
offsets occur since stars seen through a cloud do not represent the same
population as stars in an extinction free control field.",2006-04-11T13:15:49Z
Enhanced polarization of CMB from thermal gravitational waves,"If inflation was preceded by a radiation era then at the time of inflation
there will exist a decoupled thermal distribution of gravitons. Gravitational
waves generated during inflation will be amplified by the process of stimulated
emission into the existing thermal distribution of gravitons. Consequently the
usual zero temperature scale invariant tensor spectrum is modified by a
temperature dependent factor. This thermal correction factor amplify the
$B$-mode polarization of the CMB by an order of magnitude at large angles,
which may now be in the range of observability of WMAP.",2006-07-04T12:17:05Z
First Year Performance of The IceCube Neutrino Telescope,"The first sensors of the IceCube neutrino observatory were deployed at the
South Pole during the austral summer of 2004-05 and have been producing data
since February 2005. One string of 60 sensors buried in the ice and a surface
array of 8 ice Cherenkov tanks took data until December 2005 when deployment of
the next set of strings and tanks began. We have analyzed these data,
demonstrating that the performance of the system meets or exceeds design
requirements. Times are determined across the whole array to a relative
precision of better than 3 nanoseconds, allowing reconstruction of muon tracks
and light bursts in the ice, of air-showers in the surface array and of events
seen in coincidence by surface and deep-ice detectors separated by up to 2.5
km.",2006-04-20T23:25:06Z
"SINFONI adaptive optics integral field spectroscopy of the Circinus
  Galaxy","Aims. To investigate the star formation activity and the gas and stellar
dynamics on scales of a few parsecs in the nucleus of the Circinus Galaxy.
Methods.Using the adaptive optics near infrared integral field spectrometer
SINFONI on the VLT, we have obtained observations of the Circinus galaxy on
scales of a few parsecs and at a spectral resolution of 70 km s^{-1} FWHM. The
physical properties of the nucleus are analyzed by means of line and velocity
maps extracted from the SINFONI datacube. Starburst models are constrained
using the Br-gamma flux, stellar continuum (as traced via the CO absorption
bandheads longward of 2.3um), and radio continuum. Results. The similarity of
the morphologies of the H_2 (1-0)S(1) 2.12um and Br-gamma 2.17um lines to the
stellar continuum and also their kinematics, suggest a common origin in star
formation. Within 8 pc of the AGN we find there has been a recent starburst in
the last 100 Myr, which currently accounts for 1.4% of the galaxy's bolometric
luminosity. The similarity of the spatial scales over which the stars and gas
exist indicates that this star formation is occuring within the torus; and
comparison of the gas column density through the torus to the maximum possible
optical depth to the stars implies the torus is a clumpy medium. The coronal
lines show asymmetric profiles with a spatially compact narrow component and a
spatially extended blue wing. These characteristics are consistent with some of
the emission arising in clouds gravitationally bound to the AGN, and some
outflowing in cloudlets which have been eroded away from the bound clouds.",2006-04-13T19:33:17Z
"On the search of electromagnetic cosmological counterparts to
  coalescences of massive black hole binaries","We explore the nature of possible electromagnetic counterparts of
coalescences of massive black hole binaries at cosmological distances
detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). An electromagnetic
precursor, during the last year of gravitational wave (GW)-driven inspiral, or
an afterglow within few years after coalescence, may highlight the position in
the sky of galaxies hosting LISA sources. We show that observations of
precursors and afterglows are mutually exclusive, depending on the mass of the
primary black hole. Precursors are expected to occur in binaries where the
primary (more massive) black hole is heavier than ~10^7 \Msun. They may
correspond to on-off states of accretion, i.e., to a bright X-ray source
decaying into quiescence before black hole coalescence, and are likely
associated to disturbed galaxies showing signs of ongoing starbursts.
Coalescences of lighter binaries, with masses <5x10^6 \Msun, lack of any
precursor, as gas is expected to be consumed long before the GW-driven orbital
decay. Such events would not be hosted by (massive) galaxies with an associated
starburst, given the slow binary inspiral time compared to the typical time
scale of starbursts. By contrast, coalescence, for such light binaries, is
followed by an electromagnetic afterglow, i.e., an off-on accretion state
rising in <20 yrs. Using a cosmological merger tree algorithm, we show that
future X-ray missions such as XEUS will be able to identify, in 20 yrs
operation, almost all the massive BH binary detectable by LISA, and, in only 5
yrs, all the LISA sources at z>6.",2006-05-24T13:21:18Z
"Line Strengths in Early-Type Cluster Galaxies at z=0.33: Implications
  for alpha/Fe, Nitrogen and the Histories of E/S0s","[Heavily Abbreviated] In this paper we analyze previously published spectra
with high signal-to-noise ratios of E/S0 galaxies in the rich cluster CL1358+62
at z=0.33, and introduce techniques for fitting stellar population models to
the data. Here we focus on the 19 E and S0 galaxies with an homogeneous set of
eight blue Lick indices. We explore the galaxy properties using six-parameter
stellar population models from the literature, and describe an approach for
fitting the models differentially, such that the largest systematic errors are
avoided. We find: (1) no differences between the stellar population parameters
of Es and S0s, at fixed sigma; (2) the stars in the Es and S0s are uniformly
old, consistent with previously published results using M/L ratios; (3) a
significant correlation of [Z/H] with sigma, in a manner consistent with the
observed B-V colors of the galaxies; (4) no significant correlation of
[alpha/Fe] with sigma; and (5) a significant anti-correlation of [alpha/N] with
[Z/H], which we interpret as the signature of secondary nitrogen. Neither
[alpha/C], nor [alpha/Ca] shows significant variation. While the differences
between our conclusions and the current view of stellar populations may point
to serious deficiencies, our deduced correlation of mean metallicity with sigma
does reproduce the B-V colors of the galaxies, as well as the slope of the
local Mg-sigma relation. In matching the inferred population trends with
published data on nearby galaxies, the line strength-line width relations match
well, save for the narrow iron indices. Taken together, these results reduce
early-type galaxies in clusters to a family with one-parameter, velocity
dispersion, greatly simplifying scenarios for their formation and evolution.",2006-06-27T07:32:35Z
Orbital Parameters for the X-ray Pulsar IGR J16393-4643,"With recent and archival Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) X-ray
measurements of the heavily obscured X-ray pulsar IGR J16393-4643, we carried
out a pulse timing analysis to determine the orbital parameters. Assuming a
circular orbit, we phase-connected data spanning over 1.5 years. The most
likely orbital solution has a projected semi-major axis of 43 +- 2 lt-s and an
orbital period of 3.6875 +- 0.0006 days. This implies a mass function of 6.5 +-
1.1 M_sun and confirms that this INTEGRAL source is a High Mass X-ray Binary
(HMXB) system. By including eccentricity in the orbital model, we find e < 0.25
at the 2 sigma level. The 3.7 day orbital period and the previously known ~910
s pulse period place the system in the region of the Corbet diagram populated
by supergiant wind accretors, and the low eccentricity is also consistent with
this type of system. Finally, it should be noted that although the 3.7 day
solution is the most likely one, we cannot completely rule out two other
solutions with orbital periods of 50.2 and 8.1 days.",2006-05-25T22:53:10Z
"Oxygen Chemistry in the Circumstellar Envelope of the Carbon-Rich Star
  IRC+10216","In this paper we study the oxygen chemistry in the C-rich circumstellar
shells of IRC+10216. The recent discoveries of oxygen bearing species (water,
hydroxyl radical and formaldehyde) toward this source challenge our current
understanding of the chemistry in C-rich circumstellar envelopes. The presence
of icy comets surrounding the star or catalysis on iron grain surfaces have
been invoked to explain the presence of such unexpected species. This detailed
study aims at evaluating the chances of producing O-bearing species in the
C-rich circumstellar envelope only by gas phase chemical reactions. For the
inner hot envelope, it is shown that although most of the oxygen is locked in
CO near the photosphere (as expected for a C/O ratio greater than 1), some
stellar radii far away species such as H2O and CO2 have large abundances under
the assumption of thermochemical equilibrium. It is also shown how non-LTE
chemistry makes very difficult the CO-->H2O,CO2 transformation predicted in
LTE. Concerning the chemistry in the outer and colder envelope, we show that
formaldehyde can be formed through gas phase reactions. However, in order to
form water vapor it is necessary to include a radiative association between
atomic oxygen and molecular hydrogen with a quite high rate constant. The
chemical models explain the presence of HCO+ and predict the existence of SO
and H2CS (which has been detected in a 3 mm line survey to be published). We
have modeled the line profiles of H2CO, H2O, HCO+, SO and H2CS using a
non-local radiative transfer model and the abundance profiles predicted by our
chemical model. The results have been compared to the observations and
discussed.",2006-05-25T10:16:12Z
The SUGRA Quintessence Model Coupled to the MSSM,"We study the cosmological evolution of the universe when quintessence is
modeled within supergravity, supersymmetry is broken in a hidden sector, and we
also include observable matter in a third independent sector. We find that the
presence of hidden sector supersymmetry breaking leads to modifications of the
quintessence potential. We focus on the coupling of the SUGRA quintessence
model to the MSSM and investigate two possibilities. First one can preserve the
form of the SUGRA potential provided the hidden sector dynamics is tuned. The
currently available limits on the violations of the equivalence principle imply
a universal bound on the vacuum expectation value of the quintessence field
now, \kappa ^{1/2}Q\ll 1. On the other hand, the hidden sector fields may be
stabilised leading to a minimum of the quintessence potential where the
quintessence field acquires a mass of the order of the gravitino mass, large
enough to circumvent possible gravitational problems. However, the cosmological
evolution of the quintessence field is affected by the presence of the minimum
of the potential. The quintessence field settles down at the bottom of the
potential very early in the history of the universe. Both at the background and
the perturbation levels, the subsequent effect of the quintessence field is
undistinguishable from a pure cosmological constant",2006-06-13T09:44:30Z
Observed Planetary Nebulae as Descendants of Interacting Binary Systems,"We examine recent studies on the formation rate of planetary nebulae and find
this rate to be about one-third of the formation rate of white dwarfs. This
implies than only about one-third of all planetary nebulae that evolve to form
white dwarfs are actually bright enough to be observed. This finding
corresponds with the claim that it is necessary for a binary companion to
interact with the asymptotic giant branch stellar progenitor for the descendant
planetary nebulae to be bright enough to be detected. The finding about the
formation rate also strengthens De Marco's conjecture that the majority of
observed planetary nebulae harbor binary systems. In other words, single stars
almost never form observed planetary nebulae.",2006-03-05T06:26:59Z
Evidence for a population of beamed radio intermediate quasars,"Whether radio intermediate quasars possess relativistic jets as radio-loud
quasars is an important issue in the understanding of the origin of radio
emission in quasars. In this letter, using the two-epoch radio data obtained
during Faint Image of Radio Sky at Twenty centimeter sky (FIRST) and NOAO VLA
Sky Survey (NVSS), we identify 89 radio variable sources in the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey. Among them, more than half are radio intermediate quasars
(RL=f2cm/f2500A<250). For all objects with available multiple band radio
observations, the radio spectra are either flat or inverted. The brightness
temperature inferred from the variability is larger than the synchrotron-self
Compton limit for a stationary source in 87 objects, indicating of relativistic
beaming. Considering the sample selection and viewing angle effect, we conclude
that relativistic jets probably exist in a substantianl fraction of radio
intermediate quasars.",2006-03-19T13:05:14Z
OB Stars in the Solar Neighborhood II: Kinematics,"Using the spatial classification method and the structural parameters
estimated for the Gould Belt (GB) and the local Galactic disk (LGD) from a
previous paper, we have evaluated spatial membership probabilities for a sample
of O and B stars from the Hipparcos catalogue (ESA 1997) with available proper
motions and radial velocity data. Thus being able to study the space velocity
fields of both systems, we conclude that the GB and the LGD present different
statistical distributions, both in the velocity space as well as in the phase
space. In the light of the existence of both systems we analyze different
kinematic aspects in the vicinity of the Sun, and we find the GB to be
responsible for the highly negative vertex deviation found for the OB stars in
the solar neighborhood. We also find that the GB sensibly alters the estimation
of Oort's constants in the Galactic disk; thus, in order to establish
comparisons with other kinematic studies based in older stellar populations, a
careful pruning of the GB members must be performed. Further analysis of the GB
velocity field and the moving groups that contribute to it suggest the
possibility that the GB can be the result of a chance superposition of moving
groups. We propose for future investigations the dynamical analysis of these
moving groups in order to probe the origin of the GB.",2006-05-17T09:13:18Z
Nonminimal Inflation and the Running Spectral Index,"We study a class of models in which the inflaton is minimally coupled to
gravity with a term $f(R)\vp^2$. We focus in particular on the case when $f\sim
R^2$, the expansion of the scale factor is driven by the usual potential
energy, while the rolling of the inflaton is driven by the nonminial coupling.
We show that the power spectrum is in general blue, and the problem of getting
a running spectral index is eased. However, the inflaton potential must have a
large second derivative in order to get a large running.",2006-07-24T12:01:02Z
A focal plane detector design for a wide-band Laue-lens telescope,"The energy range above 60 keV is important for the study of many open
problems in high energy astrophysics such as the role of Inverse Compton with
respect to synchrotron or thermal processes in GRBs, non thermal mechanisms in
SNR, the study of the high energy cut-offs in AGN spectra, and the detection of
nuclear and annihilation lines. Recently the development of high energy Laue
lenses with broad energy bandpasses from 60 to 600 keV have been proposed for a
Hard X ray focusing Telescope (HAXTEL) in order to study the X-ray continuum of
celestial sources. The required focal plane detector should have high detection
efficiency over the entire operative range, a spatial resolution of about 1 mm,
an energy resolution of a few keV at 500 keV and a sensitivity to linear
polarization. We describe a possible configuration of the focal plane detector
based on several CdTe/CZT pixelated layers stacked together to achieve the
required detection efficiency at high energy. Each layer can operate both as a
separate position sensitive detector and polarimeter or work with other layers
to increase the overall photopeak efficiency. Each layer has a hexagonal shape
in order to minimize the detector surface required to cover the lens field of
view. The pixels would have the same geometry so as to provide the best
coupling with the lens point spread function and to increase the symmetry for
polarimetric studies.",2006-05-19T12:56:34Z
"Prompt and Afterglow Emission Properties of Gamma-Ray Bursts with
  Spectroscopically Identified Supernovae","We present a detailed spectral analysis of the prompt and afterglow emission
of four nearby long-soft gamma-ray bursts (GRBs 980425, 030329, 031203, and
060218) that were spectroscopically found to be associated with type Ic
supernovae, and compare them to the general GRB population. For each event, we
investigate the spectral and luminosity evolution, and estimate the total
energy budget based upon broadband observations. The observational inventory
for these events has become rich enough to allow estimates of their energy
content in relativistic and sub-relativistic form. The result is a global
portrait of the effects of the physical processes responsible for producing
long-soft GRBs. In particular, we find that the values of the energy released
in mildly relativistic outflows appears to have a significantly smaller scatter
than those found in highly relativistic ejecta. This is consistent with a
picture in which the energy released inside the progenitor star is roughly
standard, while the fraction of that energy that ends up in highly relativistic
ejecta outside the star can vary dramatically between different events.",2006-07-06T14:52:52Z
"High Energy Neutrinos and Cosmic-Rays from Low-Luminosity Gamma-Ray
  Bursts?","The recently discovered gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 060218/SN 2006aj is
classified as an X-ray Flash with very long duration driven possibly by a
neutron star. Since GRB 060218 is very near about 140 Mpc and very dim,
one-year observation by Swift suggests that the rate of GRB 060218-like events
might be very high so that such low luminosity GRBs (LL-GRBs) might form a
different population from the cosmological high luminosity GRBs (HL-GRBs). We
found that the high energy neutrino background from LL-GRBs could be comparable
with that from HL-GRBs. If each neutrino event is detected by IceCube, later
optical-infrared follow-up observations such as by Subaru and HST have
possibilities to identify a Type Ibc supernova associated with LL-GRBs, even if
gamma- and X-rays are not observed by Swift. This is in a sense a new window
from neutrino astronomy, which might enable us to confirm the existence of
LL-GRBs and to obtain information about their rate and origin. We also argue
LL-GRBs as high energy gamma-ray and cosmic-ray sources.",2006-07-06T13:12:35Z
Wolf-Rayet Populations at High Metallicity,"Observed properties of Wolf-Rayet stars at high metallicity are reviewed.
Wolf-Rayet stars are more common at higher metallicity, as a result of stronger
mass-loss during earlier evolutionary phases with late WC subtypes signatures
of solar metallicity or higher. Similar numbers of early (WC4-7) and late
(WC8-9) stars are observed in the Solar neighbourhood, whilst late subtypes
dominate at higher metallicities, such as Westerlund 1 in the inner Milky Way
and in M83. The observed trend to later WC subtype within metal-rich
environments is intimately linked to a metallicity dependence of WR stars, in
the sense that strong winds preferentially favour late subtypes. This has
relevance to (a) the upper mass limit in metal-rich galaxies such as NGC 3049,
due to softer ionizing fluxes from WR stars at high metallicity; (b)
evolutionary models including a WR metallicity dependence provide a better
match to the observed N(WC)/N(WN) ratio. The latter conclusion partially rests
upon the assumption of constant line luminosities for WR stars, yet
observations and theoretical atmospheric models reveal higher line fluxes at
high metallicity.",2006-08-03T11:10:40Z
"Stellar model atmospheres with magnetic line blanketing. III. The role
  of magnetic field inclination","Context. See abstract in the paper.
  Aims. In the last paper of this series we study the effects of the magnetic
field, varying its strength and orientation, on the model atmosphere structure,
the energy distribution, photometric colors and the hydrogen Balmer line
profiles. We compare with the previous results for an isotropic case in order
to understand whether there is a clear relation between the value of the
magnetic field angle and model changes, and to study how important the
additional orientational information is. Also, we examine the probable
explanation of the visual flux depressions of the magnetic chemically peculiar
stars in the context of this work.
  Methods. We calculated one more grid of the model atmospheres of magnetic A
and B stars for different effective temperatures (Teff=8000K, 11000K, 15000K),
magnetic field strengths (B=0, 5, 10, 40 kG) and various angles of the magnetic
field (Omega=0-90 degr) with respect to the atmosphere plane. We used the
LLmodels code which implements a direct method for line opacity calculation,
anomalous Zeeman splitting of spectral lines, and polarized radiation transfer.
  Results. We have not found significant changes in model atmosphere structure,
photometric and spectroscopic observables or profiles of hydrogen Balmer lines
as we vary the magnetic field inclination angle Omega. The strength of the
magnetic field plays the main role in magnetic line blanketing. We show that
the magnetic field has a clear relation to the visual flux depressions of the
magnetic CP stars.
  Conclusions. See abstract in the paper.",2006-07-20T04:20:17Z
Mechanical Model for Relativistic Blast Waves,"Relativistic blast waves can be described by a mechanical model. In this
model, the ""blast"" -- the compressed gas between the forward and reverse shocks
-- is viewed as one hot body. Equations governing its dynamics are derived from
conservation of mass, energy, and momentum. Simple analytical solutions are
obtained in the two limiting cases of ultra-relativistic and non-relativistic
reverse shock. Equations are derived for the general explosion problem.",2006-07-28T12:25:48Z
"A Sensitive Search for Variability in Late L Dwarfs: The Quest for
  Weather","We have conducted a photometric monitoring program of 3 field late-L brown
dwarfs looking for evidence of non-axisymmetric structure or temporal
variability in their photospheres. The observations were performed using
Spitzer/IRAC 4.5 and 8 micron bandpasses and were designed to cover at least
one rotational period of each object. One-sigma RMS (root mean squared)
uncertainties of less than 3 mmag at 4.5 micron and around 9 mmag at 8 micron
were achieved. Two out of the three objects studied exhibit some modulation in
their light curves at 4.5 micron - but not 8 micron - with periods of 7.4 hr
and 4.6 hr and peak-to-peak amplitudes of 10 mmag and 8 mmag. Although the lack
of detectable 8 micron variation suggests an instrumental origin for the
detected variations, the data may nevertheless still be consistent with
intrinsic variability since the shorter wavelength IRAC bandpasses probe more
deeply into late L dwarf atmospheres than the longer wavelengths. A cloud
feature occupying a small percentage (1-2 %) of the visible hemisphere could
account for the observed amplitude of variation. If, instead, the variability
is indeed instrumental in origin, then our non-variable L dwarfs could be
either completely covered with clouds or objects whose clouds are smaller and
uniformly distributed. Such scenarios would lead to very small photometric
variations. Followup IRAC photometry at 3.6 and 5.8 micron bandpasses should
distinguish between the two cases. In any event, the present observations
provide the most sensitive search to date for structure in the photospheres of
late-L dwarfs at mid-IR wavelengths, and our photometry provides stringent
upper limits to the extent to which the photospheres of these transition L
dwarfs are structured.",2006-07-24T13:00:32Z
"Chemical Abundances in the Secondary Star of the Black Hole Binary V4641
  Sagittarii (SAX J1819.3-2525)","We report on detailed spectroscopic studies performed for the secondary star
in the black hole binary (micro-quasar) V4641 Sgr in order to examine its
surface chemical composition and to see if its surface shows any signature of
pollution by ejecta from a supernova explosion. High-resolution spectra of
V4641 Sgr observed in the quiescent state in the blue-visual region are
compared with those of the two bright well-studied B9 stars (14 Cyg and $\nu$
Cap) observed with the same instrument. The effective temperature of V4641 Sgr
(10500 $\pm$ 200 K) is estimated from the strengths of He~{\sc i} lines, while
its rotational velocity, $\it v$ sin $\it i$ (95 $\pm$ 10 km s${}^{-1}$), is
estimated from the profile of the Mg~{\sc ii} line at 4481 \AA. We obtain
abundances of 10 elements and find definite over-abundances of N (by 0.8 dex or
more) and Na (by 0.8 dex) in V4641 Sgr. From line-by-line comparisons of eight
other elements (C, O, Mg, Al, Si, Ti, Cr, and Fe) between V4641 Sgr and the two
reference stars, we conclude that there is no apparent difference in the
abundances of these elements between V4641 Sgr and the two normal late B-type
stars, which have been reported to have solar abundances. An evolutionary model
of a massive close binary system has been constructed to explain the abundances
observed in V4641 Sgr. The model suggests that the progenitor of the black hole
forming supernova was as massive as ~ 35 Msun on the main-sequence and, after
becoming a ~ 10 Msun He star, underwent ""dark"" explosion which ejected only N
and Na-rich outer layer of the He star without radioactive $^{56}$Ni.",2006-07-03T04:29:30Z
Sterile neutrinos in the Milky Way: Observational constraints,"We consider the possibility of constraining decaying dark matter by looking
out through the Milky Way halo. Specifically we use Chandra blank sky
observations to constrain the parameter space of sterile neutrinos. We find
that a broad band in parameter space is still open, leaving the sterile
neutrino as an excellent dark matter candidate.",2006-03-24T17:23:35Z
The non-Gaussian Cold Spot in the 3-year WMAP data,"The non-Gaussian cold spot detected in wavelet space in the WMAP 1-year data,
is detected again in the coadded WMAP 3-year data at the same position (b =
-57, l = 209) and size in the sky (around 10 degrees). The present analysis is
based on several statistical methods: kurtosis, maximum absolute temperature,
number of pixels below a given threshold, volume and Higher Criticism. All
these methods detect deviations from Gaussianity in the 3--year data set at a
slightly higher confidence level than in the WMAP 1-year data. These small
differences are mainly due to the new foreground reduction technique and not to
the reduction of the noise level, which is negligible at the scale of the spot.
In order to avoid ""a posteriori"" analyses, we recalculate for the WMAP 3-year
data the significance of the deviation in the kurtosis. The skewness and
kurtosis tests were the first tests performed with wavelets for the WMAP data.
We obtain that the probability of finding an at least as high deviation in
Gaussian simulations is 1.85%. The frequency dependence of the spot is shown to
be extremely flat. Galactic foreground emissions are not likely to be
responsible for the detected deviation from Gaussianity.",2006-03-31T19:08:21Z
Effect of r-mode instability on the evolution of isolated strange stars,"We studied the evolution of isolated strange stars synthetically, considering
the influence of {\it r-}mode instability. Our results show that the cooling of
strange stars with non-ultra strong magnetic fields is delayed by the heating
due to the {\it r-}modes damping during million years, while the spin-down of
the stars is dominated by gravitational radiation. Especially for the strange
stars in a possible existing color-flavor locked phase, the effect of the {\it
r-}mode instability on the evolution of the stars becomes extremely important
since the viscosity, the neutrino emissivity, and the specific heat involving
paring quarks are blocked. It leads to the cooling of these color
superconducting stars is very slow, and the stars can remain high temperature
within million years differing completely from previous understanding. In this
case, a strange star in color-flavor locked phase can be located at the bottom
of its {\it r-}mode instability window for a long time, but does not spin down
to a very low frequency within hours.",2006-04-06T08:18:21Z
$^6$Li Production by the Radiative Decay of Long-Lived Particles,"Recent spectroscopic observations of metal poor stars have indicated that
both $^7$Li and $^6$Li have abundance plateaus with respect to the metallicity.
Abundances of $^7$Li are about a factor three lower than the primordial
abundance predicted by standard big-bang nucleosynthesis (SBBN), and $^6$Li
abundances are $\sim 1/20$ of $^7$Li, whereas SBBN predicts negligible amounts
of $^6$Li compared to the detected level. These discrepancies suggest that
$^6$Li has another cosmological or Galactic origin than the SBBN. Furthermore,
it would appear that $^7$Li (and also $^6$Li) has been depleted from its
primordial abundance by some post-BBN processes. In this paper we study the
possibility that the radiative decay of long-lived particles has affected the
cosmological lithium abundances. We calculate the non-thermal nucleosynthesis
associated with the radiative decay and explore the allowed region of the
parameters specifying the properties of long-lived particles. We also impose
constraints from observations of the CMB energy spectrum. We find that
non-thermal nucleosynthesis produces $^6$Li at the level detected in metal poor
halo stars (MPHSs), when the lifetime of the unstable particles is of the order
$\sim 10^8-10^{12}$~s and their initial abundance with respect to that of the
photons is $\sim (10^{-13}-10^{-12}~{\rm GeV})/E_{\gamma 0}$, where $E_{\gamma
0}$ is the emitted photon energy in the radiative decay. We conclude that the
most likely nucleosynthetic scenario involves two different processes. First, a
non-thermal cosmological nucleosynthesis associated with the radiative decay of
unstable particles; and second, the stellar depletion of both of the primordial
lithium isotopic abundances.",2006-05-10T12:36:53Z
A Transiting Planet of a Sun-like Star,"A planet transits an 11th magnitude, G1V star in the constellation Corona
Borealis. We designate the planet XO-1b, and the star, XO-1, also known as GSC
02041-01657. XO-1 lacks a trigonometric distance; we estimate it to be 200+-20
pc. Of the ten stars currently known to host extrasolar transiting planets, the
star XO-1 is the most similar to the Sun in its physical characteristics: its
radius is 1.0+-0.08 R_Sun, its mass is 1.0+-0.03 M_Sun, V sini < 3 km/s, and
its metallicity [Fe/H] is 0.015+-0.04. The orbital period of the planet XO-1b
is 3.941534+-0.000027 days, one of the longer ones known. The planetary mass is
0.90+-0.07 M_Jupiter, which is marginally larger than that of other transiting
planets with periods between 3 and 4 days. Both the planetary radius and the
inclination are functions of the spectroscopically determined stellar radius.
If the stellar radius is 1.0+-0.08 R_Sun, then the planetary radius is
1.30+-0.11 R_Jupiter and the inclination of the orbit is 87.7+-1.2 degrees. We
have demonstrated a productive international collaboration between professional
and amateur astronomers that was important to distinguishing this planet from
many other similar candidates.",2006-05-17T14:16:14Z
Multi-Object Spectroscopy Field Configuration by Simulated Annealing,"Multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) instruments, such as the Two-degree Field
(2dF) facility of the Anglo-Australian Observatory (AAO), have facilitated
large-scale redshift surveys. Yet despite their acclaim, instrument design has
been suspected of introducing subtle selection effects into surveys.
Investigation into these selection effects has been overshadowed by instrument
complexity. We identify the field configuration algorithm (FCA) used to select
targets for observation as mainly responsible for such effects. A FCA can
imprint artificial structure on observed target distributions, which may accrue
over large angular scales, potentially to the detriment of statistical analyses
applied to such surveys. We present here a new FCA developed for 2dF that is
based on simulated annealing (SA), a generic method commonly used to solve
constrained optimisation problems. We generate synthetic fields and utilise
mock 2dF volumes to contrast the behaviour of previous strategies with the SA
FCA. The angular two-point correlation function and other sensitive techniques
reveal that the new FCA achieves unprecedented sampling uniformity and target
yield with improved target priority handling and observational flexibility over
current FCAs. The SA FCA is generic enough to be used by current 2dF-like and
potentially next-generation MOS instruments with little modification.",2006-07-07T05:49:29Z
Are Short GRBs Really Hard?,"Thanks to the rapid position notice and response by HETE-2 and Swift, the
X-ray afterglow emissions have been found for four recent short gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs; GRB 050509b, GRB 050709, GRB 050724, and GRB 050813). The
positions of three out of four short GRBs are coincident with galaxies with no
current or recent star formation. This discovery tightens the case for a
different origin for short and long GRBs. On the other hand, from the prompt
emission point of view, a short GRB shows a harder spectrum comparing to that
of the long duration GRBs according to the BATSE observations. We investigate
the prompt emission properties of four short GRBs observed by Swift/BAT. We
found that the hardness of all four BAT short GRBs is in between the BATSE
range for short and long GRBs. We will discuss the spectral properties of short
GRBs including the short GRB sample of Konus-Wind and HETE-2 to understand the
hard nature of the BATSE short GRBs.",2006-05-30T13:44:01Z
A Genuine Intermediate-Age Globular Cluster in M33,"We present deep integrated-light spectroscopy of nine M33 globular clusters
taken with the Hectospec instrument at the MMT Observatory. Based on our
spectroscopy and previous deep color-magnitude diagrams obtained with
HST/WFPC2, we present evidence for the presence of a genuine intermediate-age
globular cluster in M33. The analysis of Lick line indices indicates that all
globular clusters are metal-poor ([Z/H] <~ -1.0) and that cluster M33-C38 is
about 5-8 Gyr younger than the rest of the sample M33 star clusters. We find no
evidence for a population of blue horizontal branch stars in the CMD of
M33-C38, which rules out the possibility of an artificially young spectroscopic
age due to the presence of hot stars. We infer a total mass of 5-9 x 10^4 M_sol
for M33-C38, which implies that M33-C38 has survived ~2-3 times longer than
some dynamical evolution model predictions for star clusters in M33, although
it is not yet clear to which dynamical component of M33 - thin disk, thick
disk, halo - the cluster is associated.",2006-06-19T17:49:23Z
Vlbi Diagnostics of Jet Instabilities in 0836+710,"In this paper, we present new VLBA observations of the radio jet in the
quasar S5 0836+710 at 8 and 22 GHz. The identification of the ridge lines allow
us to interpret the jet structure in terms of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.
Combined with previous epochs of VLBA and VSOP data at 1.6 and 5 GHz, these new
observations will allow us to study the evolution of the instabilities in the
jet. We have detected signatures of possible jet disruption in the jet due to
the growth of instabilities, which points towards a possible morphological
classification of the source as an FRI, contrary to what previously thought in
terms of luminosity criteria.",2006-07-17T14:49:49Z
"Numerical Simulations of the Lyman-alpha forest - A comparison of
  Gadget-2 and Enzo","We compare simulations of the Lyman-alpha forest performed with two different
hydrodynamical codes, Gadget-2 and Enzo. A comparison of the dark matter power
spectrum for simulations run with identical initial conditions show differences
of 1-3% at the scales relevant for quantitative studies of the Lyman-alpha
forest. This allows a meaningful comparison of the effect of the different
implementations of the hydrodynamic part of the two codes. Using the same
cooling and heating algorithm in both codes the differences in the temperature
and the density probability distribution function are of the order of 10%.
These differences can be mainly attributed to a slight mismatch in the
resolution. The differences are smaller than or equal to the effects of boxsize
and resolution on these statistics. Once resolution effects are taken into
account the differences in the flux power spectrum - the statistics most widely
used for estimating the matter power spectrum and cosmological parameters from
Lyman-alpha forest data - are about 5%. This is again smaller than or equal to
the effects of boxsize and resolution. Numerical uncertainties due to a
particular implementation of solving the hydrodynamic or gravitational
equations appear therefore to contribute only moderately to the error budget in
estimates of the flux power spectrum from numerical simulations. We further
find that the differences in the flux power spectrum for Enzo simulations run
with and without adaptive mesh refinement are also of order 5% or smaller. The
latter require 10 times less CPU time making the CPU time requirement similar
to that of a version of Gadget-2 that is optimised for Lyman-alpha forest
simulations.",2006-06-27T12:59:21Z
"The star formation history of early-type galaxies as a function of mass
  and environment","Using the third data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) we have
rigorously defined a volume limited sample of early-type galaxies in the
redshift range z < 0.1. We have defined the density of the local environment
for each galaxy using a method which takes account of the redshift bias
introduced by survey boundaries if traditional methods are used. At
luminosities greater than our absolute r-band magnitude cutoff of -20.45 the
mean density of environment shows no trend with redshift. We calculate the Lick
indices for the entire sample and correct for aperture effects and velocity
dispersion in a model independent way. Although we find no dependence of
redshift or luminosity with environment we do find that the mean velocity
dispersion, sigma, of early-type galaxies in dense environments tends to be
higher than in low density environments. Taking account of this effect we find
that several indices show small but very significant trends with environment
that are not the result of the correlation between indices and velocity
dispersion. The statistical significance of the data is sufficiently high to
reveal that models accounting only for alpha-enhancement struggle to produce a
consistent picture of age and metallicity of the sample galaxies, whereas a
model that also includes carbon enhancement fares much better. We find that
early-type galaxies in the field are younger than those in environments typical
of clusters but that neither metallicity, alpha-enhancement nor carbon
enhancement are influenced by the environment. The youngest early-type galaxies
in both field and cluster environments are those with the lowest sigma.
However, there is some evidence that the objects with the largest sigma are
slightly younger, especially in denser environments.",2006-03-27T09:45:06Z
"The N/O Plateau of Blue Compact Galaxies: Monte Carlo Simulations of the
  Observed Scatter","Chemical evolution models and Monte Carlo simulation techniques have been
combined for the first time to study the distribution of blue compact galaxies
on the N/O plateau. Each simulation comprises 70 individual chemical evolution
models. For each model, input parameters relating to a galaxy's star formation
history (bursting or continuous star formation, star formation efficiency),
galaxy age, and outflow rate are chosen randomly from ranges predetermined to
be relevant. Predicted abundance ratios from each simulation are collectively
overplotted onto the data to test its viability. We present our results both
with and without observational scatter applied to the model points. Our study
shows that most trial combinations of input parameters, including a simulation
comprising only simple models with instantaneous recycling, are successful in
reproducing the observed morphology of the N/O plateau once observational
scatter is added. Therefore simulations which include delay of nitrogen
injection are no longer favored over those which propose that most nitrogen is
produced by massive stars, if only the plateau morphology is used as the
principal constraint. The one scenario which clearly cannot explain plateau
morphology is one in which galaxy ages are allowed to range below 250 Myr. We
conclude that the present data for the N/O plateau are insufficient by
themselves for identifying the portion of the stellar mass spectrum most
responsible for cosmic nitrogen production.",2006-05-10T17:13:00Z
Pico: Parameters for the Impatient Cosmologist,"We present a fast, accurate, robust and flexible method of accelerating
parameter estimation. This algorithm, called Pico, can compute the CMB power
spectrum and matter transfer function as well as any computationally expensive
likelihoods in a few milliseconds. By removing these bottlenecks from parameter
estimation codes, Pico decreases their computational time by 1 or 2 orders of
magnitude. Pico has several important properties. First, it is extremely fast
and accurate over a large volume of parameter space. Furthermore, its accuracy
can continue to be improved by using a larger training set. This method is
generalizable to an arbitrary number of cosmological parameters and to any
range of l-values in multipole space. Pico is approximately 3000 times faster
than CAMB for flat models, and approximately 2000 times faster then the WMAP 3
year likelihood code. In this paper, we demonstrate that using Pico to compute
power spectra and likelihoods produces parameter posteriors that are very
similar to those using CAMB and the official WMAP3 code, but in only a fraction
of the time. Pico and an interface to CosmoMC are made publicly available at
http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~bwandelt/pico/.",2006-06-29T04:33:35Z
Spectroscopic analysis of southern B and Be stars,"Spectroscopic monitoring of 141 southern &#64257;eld B type stars, 114 of
them known to exhibit the Be phenomenon, allowed the estimation of their
projected rotational velocities, effective temperatures and super&#64257;cial
gravities from both line and equivalent width &#64257;tting procedures. Stellar
ages, masses and bolometric luminosities were derived from internal structure
models. Without taking into account for the effects of gravity darkening, we
notice the occurrence of the Be phenomenon in later stages of main sequence
phase.",2006-06-07T14:16:25Z
"A search for ultra-compact dwarf galaxies in the NGC 1023 group of
  galaxies","We present a photometric search for UCD candidates in the nearby galaxy group
NGC 1023 (d=11 Mpc) -- the poorest environment searched for UCDs yet --, based
on wide field imaging with CFHT. After photometric and morphological selection,
we obtain a sample of 21 UCD candidates with -12<M_V<-11 mag, if located at NGC
1023's distance. From spectroscopy taken at Calar Alto observatory, we identify
the UCD candidate in closest projection to NGC 1023 as an emission line
background galaxy. Our photometric data show that in the NGC 1023 group, the
mass spectrum of analogs to Fornax/Virgo UCD is restricted to about 1/4 of the
maximum Fornax/Virgo UCD mass. More spectroscopy is needed to further constrain
the mass range of UCDs in this galaxy group.",2006-03-20T11:18:02Z
Galactic Warps Induced By Cosmic Infall,"Recent ideas for the origin and persistence of the warps commonly observed in
disc galaxies have focused on cosmic infall. We present N-body simulations of
an idealized form of cosmic infall onto a disc galaxy and obtain a warp that
closely resembles those observed. The inner disc tilts remarkably rigidly,
indicating strong cohesion due to self-gravity. The line of nodes of the warp
inside $R_{26.5} ~ 4.5 \Rd$ is straight, while that beyond $R_{26.5}$ generally
forms a loosely-wound, leading spiral in agreement with Briggs's rules. We
focus on the mechanism of the warp and show that the leading spiral arises from
the torques from the misaligned inner disc and its associated inner oblate
halo. The fact that the line of nodes of most warps forms a leading spiral
might imply that the disc mass is significant in the centre. If the line of
nodes can be traced to very large radii in future observations, it may reveal
information on the mass distribution of the outer halo. The warp is not
strongly damped by the halo because the precession rate of the inner disc is
slow and the inner halo generally remains aligned with the inner disc. Thus
even after the imposed quadrupolar perturbation is removed, the warp persists
for a few Gyrs, by which time another infall event can be expected.",2006-04-25T20:01:08Z
Measuring Statistical Isotropy of CMB Anisotropy,"The statistical expectation values of the temperature fluctuations and
polarization of cosmic microwave background (CMB) are assumed to be preserved
under rotations of the sky. We investigate the statistical isotropy (SI) of the
CMB maps recently measured by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)
using the bipolar spherical harmonic formalism proposed in Hajian & Souradeep
2003 for CMB temperature anisotropy and extended to CMB polarization in Basak,
Hajian & Souradeep 2006. The Bipolar Power Spectrum (BiPS) had been measured
for the full sky CMB anisotropy maps of the first year WMAP data and now for
the recently released three years of WMAP data. We also introduce and measure
directional sensitive reduced Bipolar coefficients on the three year WMAP ILC
map. Consistent with our published results from first year WMAP data we have no
evidence for violation of statistical isotropy on large angular scales.
Preliminary analysis of the recently released first WMAP polarization maps,
however, indicate significant violation of SI even when the foreground
contaminated regions are masked out. Further work is required to confirm a
possible cosmic origin and rule out the (more likely) origin in observational
artifact such as foreground residuals at high galactic latitude.",2006-07-25T22:03:07Z
"Particle motion and gravitational lensing in the metric of a dilaton
  black hole in a de Sitter universe","We consider the metric exterior to a charged dilaton black hole in a de
Sitter universe. We study the motion of a test particle in this metric.
Conserved quantities are identified and the Hamilton-Jacobi method is employed
for the solutions of the equations of motion. At large distances from the black
hole the Hubble expansion of the universe modifies the effective potential such
that bound orbits could exist up to an upper limit of the angular momentum per
mass for the orbiting test particle. We then study the phenomenon of strong
field gravitational lensing by these black holes by extending the standard
formalism of strong lensing to the non-asymptotically flat dilaton-de Sitter
metric. Expressions for the various lensing quantities are obtained in terms of
the metric coefficients.",2006-05-09T11:05:24Z
"VADER - A Satellite Mission Concept For High Precision Dark Energy
  Studies","We present a satellite mission concept to measure the dark energy equation of
state parameter w with percent-level precision. The Very Ambitious Dark Energy
Research satellite (VADER) is a multi-wavelength survey mission joining X-ray,
optical, and IR instruments for a simultaneous spectral coverage from 4microns
(0.3eV) to 10keV over a field of view (FoV) of 1 square degree. VADER combines
several clean methods for dark energy studies, the baryonic acoustic
oscillations in the galaxy and galaxy cluster power spectrum and weak lensing,
for a joint analysis over an unrivalled survey volume. The payload consists of
two XMM-like X-ray telescopes with an effective area of 2,800cm^2 at 1.5keV and
state-of-the-art wide field DEPFET pixel detectors (0.1-10keV) in a curved
focal plane configuration to extend the FoV. The X-ray telescopes are
complemented by a 1.5m optical/IR telescope with 8 instruments for simultaneous
coverage of the same FoV from 0.3 to 4 microns. The 8 dichroic-separated bands
(u,g,r,z,J,H,K,L) provide accurate photometric galaxy redshifts, whereas the
diffraction-limited resolution of the central z-band allows precise shape
measurements for cosmic shear analysis.
  The 5 year VADER survey will cover a contiguous sky area of 3,500 square
degrees to a depth of z~2 and will yield accurate photometric redshifts and
multi-wavelength object parameters for about 175,000 galaxy clusters, one
billion galaxies, and 5 million AGN. VADER will not only provide unprecedented
constraints on the nature of dark energy, but will additionally extend and
trigger a multitude of cosmic evolution studies to very large (>10 Gyrs)
look-back times.",2006-06-28T17:36:50Z
The Effect of Substructure on Mass Estimates of Galaxies,"Large galaxies are thought to form hierarchically, from the accretion and
disruption of many smaller galaxies. Such a scenario should naturally lead to
galactic phase-space distributions containing some degree of substructure. We
examine the errors in mass estimates of galaxies and their dark halos made
using the projected phase-space distribution of a tracer population (such as a
globular cluster system or planetary nebulae) due to falsely assuming that the
tracers are distributed randomly. The level of this uncertainty is assessed by
applying a standard mass estimator to samples drawn from 11 random realizations
of galaxy halos containing levels of substructure consistent with current
models of structure formation. We find that substructure will distort our mass
estimates by up to ~20% - a negligible error compared to statistical and
measurement errors in current derivations of masses for our own and other
galaxies. However, this represents a fundamental limit to the accuracy of any
future mass estimates made under the assumption that the tracer population is
distributed randomly, regardless of the size of the sample or the accuracy of
the measurements.",2006-04-04T15:14:59Z
Strong lensing probability for testing TeVeS theory,"We calculate the strong lensing probability as a function of the
image-separation $\Delta\theta$ in TeVeS (tensor-vector-scalar) cosmology,
which is a relativistic version of MOND (MOdified Newtonian Dynamics). The
lens, often an elliptical galaxy, is modeled by the Hernquist profile. We
assume a flat cosmology with $\Omega_b=1-\Omega_\Lambda=0.04$ and the simplest
interpolating function $\mu(x)={\rm min}(1,x)$. For comparison, we recalculated
the probabilities for lenses by Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS) galaxy halos
in LCDM with Schechter-fit velocity function. The amplification bias is
calculated based on the magnification of the second bright image rather than
the total of the two brighter images. Our calculations show that the Hernquist
model predicts insufficient but acceptable probabilities in flat TeVeS
cosmology compared with the results of the well defined combined sample of
Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS) and Jodrell Bank/Very Large Array
Astrometric Survey (JVAS); at the same time, it predicts higher probabilities
than SIS model in LCDM at small image separations.",2006-06-21T09:27:55Z
"Modelling the components of binaries in Hyades: The dependence of the
  mixing-length parameter on stellar mass","We present our findings based on a detailed analysis for the binaries of the
Hyades, in which the masses of the components are well known. We fit the models
of components of a binary system to the observations so as to give the observed
total V and B-V of that system and the observed slope of the main-sequence in
the corresponding parts. According to our findings, there is a very definite
relationship between the mixing-length parameter and the stellar mass. The
fitting formula for this relationship can be given as $alpha = 9.19
(M/M_sun-0.74)^{0.053}-6.65$, which is valid for stellar masses greater than
0.77 M_sun. While no strict information is gathered for the chemical
composition of the cluster, as a result of degeneracy in the colour-magnitude
diagram, by adopting Z=0.033 and using models for the components of 70 Tau and
theta^2 Tau we find the hydrogen abundance to be X=0.676 and the age to be 670
Myr. If we assume that Z=0.024, then X=0.718 and the age is 720 Myr. Our
findings concerning the mixing length parameter are valid for both sets of the
solution. For both components of the active binary system V818 Tau, the
differences between radii of the models with Z=0.024 and the observed radii are
only about 4 percent. More generally, the effective temperatures of the models
of low mass stars in the binary systems studied are in good agreement with
those determined by spectroscopic methods.",2006-05-08T13:42:48Z
Cepheid Masses: FUSE Observations of S Mus,"S Mus is the Cepheid with the hottest known companion. The large ultraviolet
flux means that it is the only Cepheid companion for which the velocity
amplitude could be measured with the echelle mode of the HST GHRS.
Unfortunately, the high temperature is difficult to constrain at wavelengths
longer than 1200 \AA because of the degeneracy between temperature and
reddening. We have obtained a FUSE spectrum in order to improve the
determination of the temperature of the companion. Two regions which are
temperature sensitive near 16,000 K but relatively unaffected by H$_2$
absorption (940 \AA, and the Ly $\beta$ wings) have been identified. By
comparing FUSE spectra of S Mus B with spectra of standard stars, we have
determined a temperature of 17,000 $\pm$ 500 K. The resultant Cepheid mass is
6.0 $\pm$ 0.4 M$_\odot$. This mass is consistent with main sequence
evolutionary tracks with a moderate amount of convective overshoot.",2006-07-21T00:11:27Z
"Capella Corona Revisited: A Combined View from \textit{XMM-Newton} RGS,
  \textit{Chandra} HETGS, and LETGS","We present a combined analysis of the X-ray emission of the Capella corona
obtained with \textit{XMM-Newton} RGS, \textit{Chandra} HETGS, and LETGS. An
improved atomic line database and a new differential emission measure (DEM)
deconvolution method are developed for this purpose. Our new atomic database is
based on the Astrophysical Plasma Emission Database and incorporates improved
calculations of ionization equilibrium and line emissivities for L-shell ions
of abundant elements using the Flexible Atomic Code. The new DEM deconvolution
method uses a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) technique which differs from
existing MCMC or $\chi^2$-fitting based methods. We analyze the advantages and
disadvantages of each individual instrument in determining the DEM and
elemental abundances. We conclude that results from either RGS or HETGS data
alone are not robust enough due to their failure to constrain DEM in some
temperature region or the lack of significant continuum emission in the
wavelength band of the spectrometers, and that the combination of HETGS and RGS
gives more stringent constraints on the DEM and abundance determinations. Using
the LETGS data, we show that the recently discovered inconsistencies between
the EUV and X-ray lines of Fe XVIII and XIX also exist in more highly charged
iron ions, up to Fe XXIII, and that enhanced interstellar absorption due to
partially ionized plasma along the Capella line of sight may explain some, but
not all, of these discrepancies.",2006-06-12T21:19:38Z
The History of Galaxy Formation in Groups: An Observational Perspective,"We present a pedagogical review on the formation and evolution of galaxies in
groups, utilizing observational information from the Local Group to galaxies at
z~6. The majority of galaxies in the nearby universe are found in groups, and
galaxies at all redshifts up to z~6 tend to cluster on the scale of nearby
groups (~1 Mpc). This suggests that the group environment may play a role in
the formation of most galaxies. The Local Group, and other nearby groups,
display a diversity in star formation and morphological properties that puts
limits on how, and when, galaxies in groups formed. Effects that depend on an
intragroup medium, such as ram-pressure and strangulation, are likely not major
mechanisms driving group galaxy evolution. Simple dynamical friction arguments
however show that galaxy mergers should be common, and a dominant process for
driving evolution. While mergers between L_* galaxies are observed to be rare
at z < 1, they are much more common at earlier times. This is due to the
increased density of the universe, and to the fact that high mass galaxies are
highly clustered on the scale of groups. We furthermore discus why the local
number density environment of galaxies strongly correlates with galaxy
properties, and why the group environment may be the preferred method for
establishing the relationship between properties of galaxies and their local
density.",2006-05-20T23:43:26Z
An optimum time-stepping scheme for N-body simulations,"We present a new time-stepping criterion for N-body simulations that is based
on the true dynamical time of a particle. This allows us to follow the orbits
of particles correctly in all environments since it has better adaptivity than
previous time-stepping criteria used in N-body simulations. Furthermore, it
requires far fewer force evaluations in low density regions of the simulation
and has no dependence on artificial parameters such as, for example, the
softening length. This can be orders of magnitude faster than conventional
ad-hoc methods that employ combinations of acceleration and softening and is
ideally suited for hard problems, such as obtaining the correct dynamics in the
very central regions of dark matter haloes. We also derive an eccentricity
correction for a general leapfrog integration scheme that can follow
gravitational scattering events for orbits with eccentricity e -> 1 with high
precision. These new approaches allow us to study a range of problems in
collisionless and collisional dynamics from few body problems to cosmological
structure formation. We present tests of the time-stepping scheme in N-body
simulations of 2-body orbits with eccentricity e -> 1 (elliptic and
hyperbolic), equilibrium haloes and a hierarchical cosmological structure
formation run.",2006-06-23T15:31:21Z
"The RMS Survey: Radio observations of candidate massive YSOs in the
  southern hemisphere","The Red MSX Source (RMS) survey is a multi-wavelength program of follow-up
observations designed to distinguish between genuine massive young stellar
objects (MYSOs) and other embedded or dusty objects, such as ultra compact (UC)
HII regions, evolved stars and planetary nebulae (PNe). We have identified
nearly 2000 massive YSOs candidates by comparing the colours of MSX and 2MASS
point sources to those of known MYSOs. Unfortunately, there are several other
types of embedded or dust enshrouded objects that have similar colours as MYSOs
and contaminate our sample. Two sources of contamination are from UCHII regions
and PNe, both of which can be identified from the radio emission emitted by
their ionised nebulae. In order to identify UCHII regions and PNe that
contaminate our sample we have conducted high resolution radio continuum
observations at 3.6 and 6 cm of all southern MYSOs candidates ($235< l < 350$)
using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). These observations have a
spatial resolution of $\sim$1--2\arcsec and typical image rms noise values of
$\sim$0.3 mJy -- sensitive enough to detect a B0.5 star at the far side of the
Galaxy. Of the 826 RMS sources observed we found 199 to be associated with
radio emission, $\sim$25% of the sample. More significant than those sources
associated with radio emission are the 627 RMS sources for which no radio
emission was detected as these sources are still potential MYSOs. The Galactic
distribution, morphologies and spectral indices of the radio sources associated
with the RMS sources are consistent with these sources being UCHII regions. In
addition to the 826 RMS sources observed we present observations of a further
190 fields. These observations were made towards MSX sources that passed cuts
in earlier versions of the survey, but were later excluded.",2006-05-31T14:20:59Z
"Imprint of Gravitational Lensing by Population III Stars in Gamma Ray
  Burst Light Curves","We propose a novel method to extract the imprint of gravitational lensing by
Pop III stars in the light curves of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs). Significant
portions of GRBs can originate in hypernovae of Pop III stars and be
gravitationally lensed by foreground Pop III stars or their remnants. If the
lens mass is on the order of $10^2-10^3M_\odot$ and the lens redshift is
greater than 10, the time delay between two lensed images of a GRB is $\approx
1$s and the image separation is $\approx 10 \mu$as. Although it is difficult to
resolve the two lensed images spatially with current facilities, the light
curves of two images are superimposed with a delay of $\approx 1$ s. GRB light
curves usually exhibit noticeable variability, where each spike is less than
1s. If a GRB is lensed, all spikes are superimposed with the same time delay.
Hence, if the autocorrelation of light curve with changing time interval is
calculated, it should show the resonance at the time delay of lensed images.
Applying this autocorrelation method to GRB light curves which are archived as
the {\it BATSE} catalogue, we demonstrate that more than half light curves can
show the recognizable resonance, if they are lensed. Furthermore, in 1821 GRBs
we actually find one candidate of GRB lensed by a Pop III star, which may be
located at redshift 20-200. The present method is quite straightforward and
therefore provides an effective tool to search for Pop III stars at redshift
greater than 10. Using this method, we may find more candidates of GRBs lensed
by Pop III stars in the data by the {\it Swift} satellite.",2006-05-22T08:21:45Z
Spitzer Observations of Red Galaxies at High Redshifts,"I discuss constraints on star formation and AGN in massive, red galaxies at
z~1-3 using Spitzer observations at 3-24 micron. In particular I focus on a
sample of distant red galaxies (DRGs) with J - K > 2.3 in the southern Great
Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS-S) field. The DRGs have typical
stellar masses >10^11 solar masses. Interestingly, the majority (>50%) of these
objects have 24 micron flux densities >50 micro-Jy. At these redshifts massive
galaxies undergo intense (and possibly frequent) IR-active phases, which is in
constrast to lower-redshift massive galaxies. If the 24 micron emission in
these z~1-3 galaxies is attributed to star formation, then it implies star
formation rates (SFRs) in excess of ~100 solar masses per year. These galaxies
have specific SFRs equal to or exceeding the global average value at that
epoch. Thus, this is an active period in their assembly. Based on their X-ray
luminosities and near-IR colors, as many as 25% of the massive galaxies at
z>1.5 host AGN, suggesting that the growth of supermassive black holes
coincides with massive-galaxy assembly.",2006-04-11T21:02:33Z
Is cosmic expansion of the universe accelerating?,"Currently available Type Ia distant supernovae observed data seem to support
evidence that the cosmic expansion of the universe is accelerating. This
unexpected result is beyond any standard model of modern cosmology. The new
concept advanced to account for the acceleration is dark energy or quintessence
with negative pressure. Most analyses using this new form of energy describe
the observed data with great accuracy, although there has been no laboratory
confirmation of it. The present work analyzes the consequences of Thomson
scattering on Type Ia supernovae data for two significant reasons; (i) recently
observed data reveal the existence of sufficient amount of ionized baryonic
(hydrogen) dark matter in the intergalactic medium, a necessary ingredient for
Thomson scattering, and (ii) its effects have not been considered previously in
determining distances to the supernovae from their observed distance moduli.
Quantitative results of the present investigation based on observed data and
corrected for Thomson scattering are consistent with the prediction of Hubble
expansion of the universe.

"Tidal tails around globular clusters: are they good tracers of cluster
  orbits?","In the last decade, observational studies have shown the existence of tidal
streams in the outer part of many galactic globular clusters. The most striking
examples of clusters with well defined tidal tails are represented by Palomar 5
and NGC 5466 (both observed in the framework of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey),
which show structures elongated for 4 kpc and 1 kpc in length, respectively.
Unfortunately, most of the observational studies about globular clusters (GCs)
do not cover such a large field of the sky as the SDSS does. In this framework,
by mean of a parallel, adaptive tree-code, we performed detailed N-body
simulations of GCs moving in a realistic three-components (bulge, disk and
halo) Milky Way potential, in order to clarify whether and to what extent tails
in the clusters outer regions (few tidal radii) are tracers of the local orbits
and, also, if some kind of correlation exists among the cluster orbital phase
and the orientation of such streams.",2006-05-10T08:21:50Z
SuperWASP Observations of the Transiting Extrasolar planet XO-1b,"We report on observations of 11 transit events of the transiting extrasolar
planet XO-1b by the SuperWASP-North observatory. From our data, obtained during
May-September 2004, we find that the XO-1b orbital period is 3.941634 +/-
0.000137 days, the planetary radius is 1.34 +/- 0.12 Rjup and the inclination
is 88.92 +/- 1.04 degrees, in good agreement with previously published values.
We tabulate the transit timings from 2004 SuperWASP and XO data, which are the
earliest obtained for XO-1b, and which will therefore be useful for future
investigations of timing variations caused by additional perturbing planets. We
also present an ephemeris for the transits. See http://www.superwasp.org for

"C18O (3-2) observations of the Cometary Globule CG 12: a cold core and a
  C18O hot spot","The feasibility of observing the C18O (3-2) spectral line in cold clouds with
the APEX telescope has been tested. As the line at 329.330 GHz lies in the wing
of a strong atmospheric H2O absorption it can be observed only at high altitude
observatories. Using the three lowest rotational levels instead of only two
helps to narrow down the physical properties of dark clouds and globules. The
centres of two C18O maxima in the high latitude low mass star forming region CG
12 were mapped in C18O (3-2) and the data were analyzed together with spectral
line data from the SEST. The T_MB(3-2)/T_MB(2-1) ratio in the northern C18O
maximum, CG 12 N, is 0.8, and in the southern maximum, CG 12 S, ~2. CG 12 N is
modelled as a 120'' diameter (0.4pc) cold core with a mass of 27 Msun. A small
size maximum with a narrow, 0.8 kms-1, C18O (3-2) spectral line with a peak
temperature of T_MB ~11 K was detected in CG 12 S. This maximum is modelled as
a 60'' to 80'' diameter (~0.2pc) hot (80 K < Tex < 200 K) ~1.6 Msun clump. The
source lies on the axis of a highly collimated bipolar molecular outflow near
its driving source. This is the first detection of such a compact, warm object
in a low mass star forming region.",2006-06-06T13:54:04Z
The Field of Streams: Sagittarius and its Siblings,"We use Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 5 (DR5) u,g,r,i,z
photometry to study Milky Way halo substructure in the area around the North
Galactic Cap. A simple color cut (g-r < 0.4) reveals the tidal stream of the
Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal, as well as a number of other stellar structures
in the field. Two branches (A and B) of the Sagittarius stream are clearly
visible in an RGB-composite image created from 3 magnitude slices, and there is
also evidence for a still more distant wrap behind the A branch. A comparison
of these data with numerical models suggests that the shape of the Galactic
dark halo is close to spherical.",2006-05-01T12:58:45Z
Evolutionary Status of SNR 1987A at the Age of Eighteen,"$\sim$18 yr after the supernova explosion, the blast wave of SNR 1987A is
entering the main body of the equatorial circumstellar material, which is
causing a dramatic brightening of the remnant. We recently reported the
observational evidence for this event from our {\it Chandra} data (Park et al.
2005b; P05 hereafter). We present here the temporal evolution of the X-ray
emitting shock parameters and the detailed description of the spectral and
image analysis of SNR 1987A, on which P05 was based. While the remnant becomes
brighter, the softening of the overall X-ray spectrum continues and is enhanced
on around day $\sim$6200 (since the explosion). The two-component shock model
indicates that the electron temperatures have been changing for the last
$\sim$6 yr. The X-ray spectrum is now described by $kT$ $\sim$ 0.3 keV and 2.3
keV thermal plasmas which are believed to characteristically represent the
shock-heated density gradient along the boundary between the H{\small II}
region and the dense inner ring. As the blast wave sweeps through the inner
circumstellar ring shining in X-rays, we expect that the shock parameters
continue to change, revealing the density and abundance structure of the inner
ring. Follow-up {\it Chandra} observations will thus uncover the past history
of the progenitor's stellar evolution. The origin of the relatively faint hard
X-ray emission ($E$ $>$ 3 keV) from SNR 1987A is still unclear (thermal vs.
nonthermal). Considering the continuous brightening of the hard band intensity,
as well as the soft band flux, follow-up monitoring observations will also be
essential to reveal the origin of the hard X-ray emission of SNR 1987A.",2006-04-10T18:48:53Z
The Monitor project: Rotation of low-mass stars in the open cluster M34,"We report on the results of a V and i-band time-series photometric survey of
M34 (NGC 1039) using the Wide Field Camera (WFC) on the Isaac Newton Telescope
(INT), achieving better than 1% precision per data point for 13 <~ i <~ 17.
Candidate cluster members were selected from a V vs V-I colour-magnitude
diagram over 14 < V < 24 (0.12 <~ M/Msun <~ 1.0), finding 714 candidates, of
which we expect ~ 400 to be real cluster members (taking into account
contamination from the field). The mass function was computed, and found to be
consistent with a log-normal distribution in dN/dlogM. Searching for periodic
variable objects in the candidate members gave 105 detections over the mass
range 0.25 < M/Msun < 1.0. The distribution of rotation periods for 0.4 <
M/Msun < 1.0 was found to peak at ~ 7 days, with a tail of fast rotators down
to periods of ~ 0.8 days. For 0.25 < M/Msun < 0.4 we found a peak at short
periods, with a lack of slow rotators (eg. P >~ 5 days, consistent with the
work of other authors (eg. Scholz & Eisloffel 2004) at very low masses. Our
results are interpreted in the context of previous work, finding that we
reproduce the same general features in the rotational period distributions. A
number of rapid rotators were found with velocities ~ a factor of two lower
than in the Pleiades, consistent with models of angular momentum evolution
assuming solid body rotation without needing to invoke core-envelope
decoupling.",2006-05-24T09:15:32Z
"On-axis spectroscopy of the host galaxies of 20 optically luminous
  quasars at z~0.3","We present the analysis of a sample of 20 bright low-redshift quasars
(M_B<-23 and z < 0.35) observed spectroscopically with the VLT. The FORS1
spectra, obtained in Multi Object Spectroscopy (MOS) mode, allow to observe
simultaneously the quasars and several reference stars used to spatially
deconvolve the data. Applying the MCS deconvolution method, we are able to
separate the individual spectra of the quasar and of the underlying host
galaxy. Contrary to some previous claims, we find that luminous quasars are not
exclusively hosted by massive ellipticals. Most quasar host galaxies harbour
large amounts of gas, irrespective of their morphological type. Moreover, the
stellar content of half of the hosts is a young Sc-like population, associated
with a rather low metallicity interstellar medium. A significant fraction of
the galaxies contain gas ionized at large distances by the quasar radiation.
This large distance ionization is always associated with signs of gravitational
interactions (as detected from images or disturbed rotation curves). The
spectra of the quasars themselves provide evidence that gravitational
interactions bring dust and gas in the immediate surrounding of the super
massive black hole, allowing to feed it. The quasar activity might thus be
triggered (1) in young gas-rich spiral galaxies by local events and (2) in more
evolved galaxies by gravitational interactions or collisions. The latter
mechanism gives rises to the most powerful quasars. Finally, we derive mass
models for the isolated spiral host galaxies and we show that the most reliable
estimators of the systemic redshift in the quasar spectrum are the tips of the
Ha and Hb lines.",2006-05-11T10:37:46Z
"On the Fueling of Massive Black Holes and the Properties of their Host
  Spheroids","We study the relation between nuclear massive black holes and their host
spheroid gravitational potential. Using simple models, we analyze how gas is
expected to be transported in the nuclear regions of galaxies. When we couple
it with the expected gas lifetime given by the Kennicutt-Schmidt Law, this
naturally leads to the `M_BH - M_virial' and `M_BH - sigma' relations. We also
numerically test, using AMR simulations, our simple models for the mass
transport with satisfactory results.",2006-04-24T18:56:19Z
Carbon Stars in the Hamburg/ESO Survey: Abundances,"We have carried out a detailed abundance analysis for a sample of 16 carbon
stars found among candidate extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars from the
Hamburg/ESO Survey. We find that the Fe-metallicities for the cooler C-stars
(Teff ~ 5100K) have been underestimated by a factor of ~10 by the standard HES
survey tools. The results presented here provided crucial supporting data used
by Cohen et al (2006) to derive the frequency of C-stars among EMP stars.
  C-enhancement in these EMP C-stars appears to be independent of
Fe-metallicity and approximately constant at ~1/5 the solar C/H. The mostly low
C12/C13 ratios (~4) and the high N abundances in many of these stars suggest
that material which has been through proton burning via the CN cycle comprises
most of the stellar envelope. C-enhancement is associated with strong
enrichment of heavy nuclei beyond the Fe-peak for 12 of the 16 stars. The
remaining C-stars from the HES, which tend to be the most Fe-metal poor, show
no evidence for enhancement of the heavy elements. Very high enhancements of
lead are detected in some of the C-stars with highly enhanced Ba. (We show
that) the s-process is responsible for the enhancement of the heavy elements
for the majority of the C-stars in our sample.
  We suggest that both the s-process rich and Ba-normal C-stars result from
phenomena associated with mass transfer in binary systems. This leads directly
to the progression from C-stars to CH stars and then to Ba stars as the
Fe-metallicity increases. (abridged and slightly edited to shorten)",2006-03-21T18:12:05Z
"Numerical simulation of small perturbation on an accretion disk due to
  the collision of a star with the disk near the black hole","In this paper, perturbations of an accretion disk by a star orbiting around a
black hole are studied. We report on a numerical experiment, which has been
carried out by using a parallel-machine code originally developed by D\""{o}nmez
(2004). An initially steady state accretion disk near a non-rotating
(Schwarzschild) black hole interacts with a ""star"", modeled as an initially
circular region of increased density. Part of the disk is affected by the
interaction. In some cases, a gap develops and shock wave propagates through
the disk. We follow the evolution for order of one dynamical period and we show
how the non-axisymetric density perturbation further evolves and moves
downwards where the material of the disk and the star become eventually
accreted onto the central body.
  When the star perturbs the steady state accretion disk, the disk around the
black hole is destroyed by the effect of perturbation. The perturbed accretion
disk creates a shock wave during the evolution and it loses angular momentum
when the gas hits on the shock waves. Colliding gas with the shock wave is the
one of the basic mechanism of emitting the $X-$rays in the accretion disk. The
series of supernovae occurring in the inner disk could entirely destroy the
disk in that region which leaves a more massive black hole behind, at the
center of galaxies.",2006-04-11T20:20:08Z
New algorithms for adaptive optics point-spread function reconstruction,"Context. The knowledge of the point-spread function compensated by adaptive
optics is of prime importance in several image restoration techniques such as
deconvolution and astrometric/photometric algorithms. Wavefront-related data
from the adaptive optics real-time computer can be used to accurately estimate
the point-spread function in adaptive optics observations. The only
point-spread function reconstruction algorithm implemented on astronomical
adaptive optics system makes use of particular functions, named $U\_{ij}$.
These $U\_{ij}$ functions are derived from the mirror modes, and their number
is proportional to the square number of these mirror modes. Aims. We present
here two new algorithms for point-spread function reconstruction that aim at
suppressing the use of these $U\_{ij}$ functions to avoid the storage of a
large amount of data and to shorten the computation time of this PSF
reconstruction. Methods. Both algorithms take advantage of the eigen
decomposition of the residual parallel phase covariance matrix. In the first
algorithm, the use of a basis in which the latter matrix is diagonal reduces
the number of $U\_{ij}$ functions to the number of mirror modes. In the second
algorithm, this eigen decomposition is used to compute phase screens that
follow the same statistics as the residual parallel phase covariance matrix,
and thus suppress the need for these $U\_{ij}$ functions. Results. Our
algorithms dramatically reduce the number of $U\_{ij}$ functions to be computed
for the point-spread function reconstruction. Adaptive optics simulations show
the good accuracy of both algorithms to reconstruct the point-spread function.",2006-06-28T09:44:48Z
Persistent Patterns in Accretion Disks,"We present a set of new characteristic frequencies associated with accretion
disks around compact objects. These frequencies arise from persistent rotating
patterns in the disk that are finite in radial extent and driven purely by the
gravity of the central body. Their existence depends on general relativistic
corrections to orbital motion and, if observed, could be used to probe the
strong gravity region around a black hole. We also discuss a possible
connection to the puzzle of quasi-periodic oscillations.",2006-03-24T21:30:17Z
Gravitational lensing effects on the gamma-ray burst Hubble diagram,"Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) offer a potential way to extend the Hubble diagram to
very high redshifts and to constrain the nature of dark energy in a way
complementary to distant type Ia supernovae. However, gravitational lensing
systematically brightens distant GRBs through the magnification bias, in
addition to increasing the dispersions of distance measurements. We investigate
how the magnification bias limits the cosmological usage of GRBs. We perform
Monte-Carlo simulations of Swift GRBs assuming a cosmological constant
dominated universe and then constrain the dark energy equation of state
neglecting gravitational lens effects. The originally assumed model is
recovered with 68% confidence limit even when the dispersion of inferred
luminosities is comparable to that of type Ia supernovae. This implies that the
bias is not so drastic for Swift GRBs as to change constraints on dark energy
and its evolution. However, the precise degree of the bias in cosmological
parameter determinations depends strongly on the shape of the luminosity
function of GRBs. Therefore, an accurate determination of the shape of the
luminosity function is required to remove the effect of gravitational lensing
and to obtain an unbiased Hubble diagram.",2006-04-21T20:00:06Z
"X-ray emission from the double neutron star binary B1534+12: Powered by
  the pulsar wind?","We report the detection of the double neutron star binary (DNSB) B1534+12 (=
J1537+1155) with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. This DNSB (orbital period 10.1
hr) consists of the millisecond (recycled) pulsar J1537+1155A (P_A=37.9 ms) and
a neutron star not detected in the radio. After the remarkable double pulsar
binary J0737-3039, it is the only other DNSB detected in X-rays. We measured
the flux of (2.2\pm 0.6)\times10^{-15} ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2} in the 0.3-6 keV
band. The small number of collected counts allows only crude estimates of
spectral parameters. The power-law fit yields the photon index of 3.2\pm 0.5
and the unabsorbed 0.2-10 keV luminosity L_X=6\times10^{29} ergs s^{-1} =
3\times 10^{-4}Edot_A, where Edot_A is the spin-down power of J1537+1155A.
Alternatively, the spectrum can be fitted by a blackbody model with T = 2.2 MK
and the projected emitting area of ~ 5\times 10^3 m^2. The distribution of
photon arrival times over binary orbital phase shows a deficit of X-ray
emission around apastron, which suggests that the emission is caused by
interaction of the relativistic wind from J1537+1155A with its neutron star
companion. We also reanalyzed the Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of
J0737-3039 and found that its X-ray spectrum is similar to the spectrum of
B1534+12, and its X-ray luminosity is about the same fraction of Edot_A, which
suggests similar X-ray emission mechanisms. However, the X-ray emission from
J0737-3039 does not show orbital phase dependence. This difference can be
explained by the smaller eccentricity of J0737-3039 or a smaller misalignment
between the equatorial plane of the millisecond pulsar and the orbital plane of
the binary.",2006-03-31T15:54:24Z
"Smoothing Algorithms and High-order Singularities in Gravitational
  Lensing","We propose a new smoothing method for obtaining surface densities from
discrete particle positions from numerical simulations. This is an essential
step for many applications in gravitational lensing. This method is based on
the ``scatter'' interpretation of the discrete density field in the Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamics. We use Monte Carlo simulations of uniform density
fields and one isothermal ellipsoid to empirically derive the noise properties,
and best smoothing parameters (such as the number of nearest neighbors used). A
cluster from high-resolution simulations is then used to assess the reality of
high-order singularities such as swallowtails and butterflies in caustics,
which are important for the interpretation of substructures in gravitational
lenses. We also compare our method with the Delaunay tesselation field
estimator using the galaxy studied by Bradac et al. (2004), and find good
agreements. We show that higher order singularities are not only connected with
bound subhaloes but also with the satellite streams. However, the presence of
high-order singularities are sensitive to not only the fluctuation amplitude of
the surface density, but also the detailed form of the underlying smooth
lensing potential (such as ellipticity and external shear).",2006-03-21T08:21:55Z
"The Parkes multibeam pulsar survey: VI. Discovery and timing of 142
  pulsars and a Galactic population analysis","[ABRIDGED] We present the discovery and follow-up observations of 142 pulsars
found in the Parkes 20-cm multibeam pulsar survey of the Galactic plane. These
new discoveries bring the total number of pulsars found by the survey to 742.
In addition to tabulating spin and astrometric parameters, along with pulse
width and flux density information, we present orbital characteristics for 13
binary pulsars which form part of the new sample. Combining these results from
another recent Parkes multibeam survey at high Galactic latitudes, we have a
sample of 1008 normal pulsars which we use to carry out a determination of
their Galactic distribution and birth rate. We infer a total Galactic
population of 30000 +/- 1100 potentially detectable pulsars (i.e. those beaming
towards us) having 1.4-GHz luminosities above 0.1 mJy kpc squared. Using a
pulsar current analysis, we derive the birth rate of this population to be 1.4
+/- 0.2 pulsars per century. An important conclusion from our work is that the
inferred radial density function of pulsars depends strongly on the assumed
distribution of free electrons in the Galaxy. As a result, any analyses using
the most recent electron model of Cordes & Lazio predict a dearth of pulsars in
the inner Galaxy. We show that this model can also bias the inferred pulsar
scale height with respect to the Galactic plane. Combining our results with
other Parkes multibeam surveys we find that the population is best described by
an exponential distribution with a scale height of 330 pc.",2006-07-28T12:08:12Z
Tidal Mass Loss from Collisionless Systems,"We examine the problem tidally-induced mass loss from collisionless systems
such as dark matter haloes. We develop a model for tidal mass loss, based upon
the phase space distribution of particles, which accounts for how both tidal
and Coriolis torques perturb the angular momentum of each particle in the
system. This allows us to study how both the density profile and velocity
anisotropy affect the degree of mass loss--we present basic results from such a
study. Our model predicts that mass loss is a continuous process even in a
static tidal field, a consequence of the fact that mass loss weakens the
potential of the system making it easier for further mass loss to occur. We
compare the predictions of our model with N-body simulations of idealized
systems in order to check its validity. We find reasonable agreement with the
N-body simulations except for in the case of very strong tidal fields, where
our results suggest that a higher-order perturbation analysis may be required.
The continuous tidally-induced mass loss predicted by our model can lead to
substantial reduction in satellite mass in cases where the traditional
treatment predicts no mass loss. As such, our results may have important
consequences for the orbits and survival of low mass satellites in dark matter
haloes.",2006-07-03T13:49:43Z
X-ray number counts of normal galaxies,"We use the number counts of X-ray selected normal galaxies to explore their
evolution by combining the most recent wide-angle shallow and pencil-beam deep
samples available. The differential X-ray number counts, dN/dS, for early and
late-type normal galaxies are constructed separately and then compared with the
predictions of the local X-ray luminosity function under different evolution
scenarios. The dN/dS of early type galaxies is consistent with no evolution out
to z~0.5. For late-type galaxies our analysis suggests that it is the sources
with X-ray--to--optical flux ratio logfx/fopt>-2 that are evolving the fastest.
Including these systems in the late-type galaxy sample yields evolution of the
form ~(1+z)^{2.7} out to z~0.4. On the contrary late-type sources with
logfx/fopt<-2 are consistent with no evolution. This suggests that the
logfx/fopt>-2 population comprises the most powerful and fast evolving
starbursts at moderate and high-z. We argue that although residual
low-luminosity AGN contamination may bias our results toward stronger
evolution, this is unlikely to modify our main conclusions.",2006-04-11T09:07:25Z
"Numerical simulations on the relative importance of starbursts and AGN
  in ultra-luminous infrared galaxies","We investigate the relative importance of starbursts and AGN in nuclear
activities of ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) based on chemodynamical
simulations combined with spectrophotometric synthesis codes. We numerically
investigate both the gas accretion rates (m_acc) onto super massive black holes
(SMBHs) and the star formation rates (m_sf) in ULIRGs formed by gas-rich galaxy
mergers and thereby discuss what powers ULIRGs. Our principal results, which
can be tested against observations, are as follows. (1) ULIRGs powered by AGN
can be formed by major merging between luminous, gas-rich disk galaxies with
prominent bulges containing SMBHs, owing to the efficient gas fuelling m_acc >
1 M_sun/yr of the SMBH. AGN in these ULIRGs can be surrounded by compact
poststarburst stellar populations (e.g., A-type stars). (2) ULIRGs powered by
starbursts with m_sf ~ 100 M_sun/yr can be formed by merging between gas-rich
disk galaxies with small bulges having the bulge-to-disk-ratio (f_b) as small
as 0.1. (3) The relative importance of starbursts and AGN can depend on
physical properties of merger progenitor disks, such as f_b, gas mass fraction,
and total masses. For example, more massive galaxy mergers are more likely to
become AGN-dominated ULIRGs. (4) For most models, major mergers can become
ULIRGs, powered either by starbursts or by AGN, only when the two bulges
finally merge. Interacting disk galaxies can become ULIRGs with well separated
two cores (> 20kpc) at their pericenter when they are very massive and have
small bulges. (5) Irrespective of the choice of model, interacting/merging
galaxies show the highest accretion rates onto the central SMBHs, and the
resultant rapid growth of the SMBHs occur when their star formation rates are
very high.",2006-07-15T10:08:48Z
"First Spitzer Space Telescope Observations of Magnetic Cataclysmic
  Variables: Evidence for Excess Emission at 3--8 microns","We present the first observations of magnetic cataclysmic variables with the
Spitzer Space Telescope. We used the Infrared Array Camera to obtain photometry
of the polars EF Eri, GG Leo, V347 Pav, and RX J0154.0-5947 at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8,
and 8.0 $\mu$m. In all of our targets, we detect excess mid-infrared emission
over that expected from the component stars alone. We explore the origin of
this IR excess by examining bremsstrahlung, cyclotron emission, circumbinary
dust, and L/T brown dwarf secondary stars. Bremsstrahlung and cyclotron
emission appear unlikely to be significant contributors to the observed fluxes.
At present, the most likely candidate for the excess emission is dust that is
probably located in a circumbinary disk with an inner temperature near 800 K.
However, a simple dust disk plus any reasonable low mass or brown dwarf-like
secondary star is unable to fully explain the observed flux densities in the
3--8 $\mu$m region.",2006-06-08T18:34:14Z
"High Order Correction Terms for The Peak-Peak Correlation Function in
  Nearly-Gaussian Models","One possible way to investigate the nature of the primordial power spectrum
fluctuations is by investigating the statistical properties of the local
maximum in the density fluctuation fields. In this work we present a study of
the mean correlation function, $\xi_r$, and the correlation function for high
amplitude fluctuations (the peak-peak correlation) in a slighlty non-Gaussian
context. From the definition of the correlation excess, we compute the Gaussian
two-point correlation function and, using an expansion in Generalized Hermite
polynomials, we estimate the correlation of high density peaks in a
non-Gaussian field with generic distribution and power spectrum. We also apply
the results obtained to a scale-mixed distribution model, which correspond to a
nearly Gaussian model. The results reveal that, even for a small deviation from
Gaussianity, we can expect high density peaks to be much more correlated than
in a Gaussian field with the same power spectrum. In addition, the calculations
reveal how the amplitude of the peaks in the fluctuations field is related to
the existing correlations. Our results may be used as an additional tool to
investigate the behavior of the N-point correlation function, to understand how
non-Gaussian correlations affect the peak-peak statistics and extract more
information about the statistics of the density field.",2006-06-09T17:38:09Z
Search for an infrared counterpart of IGR J16358-4756,"We report here on near infrared observations of the field around IGR
J16358-4756. The source belongs to the new class of highly absorbed X-ray
binaries discovered by IBIS/INTEGRAL. Our primary goal was to identify the
infrared counterpart of the source, previously suggested to be a LMXB and then
further reclassified as a HMXB. We have made use of Chandra observations of the
source in order to better constrain the number of possible counterparts. Using
the differential photometry technique, in observations spanning a timescale of
1 month, we found no long term variability in our observations. This is
compatible, and we suggest here, that the source is a HMXB.",2006-04-07T13:17:58Z
The White Dwarf in AE Aqr Brakes Harder,"Taking advantage of the very precise de Jager et al. optical white dwarf
orbit and spin ephemerides; ASCA, XMMN, and Chandra X-ray observations spread
over 10 yrs; and a cumulative 27 yr baseline, we have found that in recent
years the white dwarf in AE Aqr is spinning down at a rate that is slightly
faster than predicted by the de Jager et al. spin ephemeris. At the present
time, the observed period evolution is consistent with either a cubic term in
the spin ephemeris with Pdouble_dot = 3.46(56)E-19 per d, which is inconsistent
in sign and magnitude with magnetic-dipole radiation losses, or an additional
quadratic term with Pdot = 2.0(1.0)E-15 d/d, which is consistent with a modest
increase in the accretion torques spinning down the white dwarf. Regular
monitoring, in the optical, ultraviolet, and/or X-rays, is required to track
the evolution of the spin period of the white dwarf in AE Aqr.",2006-04-13T17:57:58Z
"The Importance of Phase in Nulling Interferometry and a Three Telescope
  Closure-Phase Nulling Interferometer Concept","We discuss the theory of the Bracewell nulling interferometer and explicitly
demonstrate that the phase of the ""white light"" null fringe is the same as the
phase of the bright output from an ordinary stellar interferometer. As a
consequence a ""closure phase"" exists for a nulling interferometer with three or
more telescopes. We calculate the phase offset as a function of baseline length
for an Earth-like planet around the Sun at 10 pc, with a contrast ratio of
$10^{-6}$ at 10 $\mu$m. The magnitude of the phase due to the planet is $\sim
10^{-6}$ radians, assuming the star is at the phase center of the array.
Although this is small, this phase may be observable in a three-telescope
nulling interferometer that measures the closure phase. We propose a simple
non-redundant three-telescope nulling interferometer that can perform this
measurement. This configuration is expected to have improved characteristics
compared to other nulling interferometer concepts, such as a relaxation of
pathlength tolerances, through the use of the ""ratio of wavelengths"" technique,
a closure phase, and better discrimination between exodiacal dust and planets.",2006-03-24T17:23:34Z
"A Quantitative Analysis of the Available Multicolor Photometry for
  Rapidly Pulsating Hot B Subdwarfs","We present a quantitative and homogeneous analysis of the broadband
multicolor photometric data sets gathered so far on rapidly pulsating hot B
subdwarf stars. This concerns seven distinct data sets related to six different
stars. Our analysis is carried out within the theoretical framework developed
by Randall et al., which includes full nonadiabatic effects. The goal of this
analysis is partial mode identification, i.e., the determination of the degree
index l of each of the observed pulsation modes. We assume possible values of l
from 0 to 5 in our calculations. For each target star, we compute a specific
model atmosphere and a specific pulsation model using estimates of the
atmospheric parameters coming from time-averaged optical spectroscopy. For
every assumed value of l, we use a formal chi-squared approach to model the
observed amplitude-wavelength distribution of each mode, and we compute a
quality-of-fit Q probability to quantify the derived fit and to discriminate
objectively between the various solutions. We find that no completely
convincing and unambiguous l identification is possible on the basis of the
available data, although partial mode discrimination has been reached for 25
out of the 41 modes studied. A brief statistical study of these results
suggests that a majority of the modes must have l values of 0, 1, and 2, but
also that modes with l = 4 could very well be present while modes with l = 3
appear to be rarer. This is in line with recent results showing that l = 4
modes in rapidly pulsating B subdwarfs have a higher visibility in the optical
domain than modes with l = 3. Although somewhat disappointing in terms of mode
discrimination, our results still suggest that the full potential of multicolor
photometry for l identification in pulsating subdwarfs is within reach.",2006-06-20T14:51:32Z
"Modelling galaxy spectra in presence of interstellar dust. II. From the
  UV to the far infrared","In this paper, we present spectrophotometric models for galaxies of different
morphological type whose spectral energy distributions (SEDs) take into account
the effect of dust in absorbing UV-optical light and re-emitting it in the
infrared (IR). The models contain three main components: (i) the diffuse
interstellar medium (ISM) composed of gas and dust, (ii) the large complexes of
molecular clouds (MCs) in which new stars are formed and (iii) the stars of any
age and chemical composition. The galaxy models stand on a robust model of
chemical evolution taylored in such a way to match the gross properties of
galaxies of different morphological type. A simple geometrical model is adopted
for each type of galaxy. The total gas and star mass provided by the chemical
model are distributed over the whole volume by means of suitable density
profiles, one for each component and depending on the galaxy type (spheroidal,
disk and disk plus bulge). The galaxy is then split in suitable volume elements
to each of which the appropriate amounts of stars, MCs and ISM are assigned. We
derive the SEDs of galaxies of different morphological type. First the the
basic relations driving the interaction between the physical components of the
galaxy are presented. Second, the main parameters are examined and their
effects on the SED of three prototype galaxies (a disk, an elliptical and a
starburster) are highlighted. The final part of the paper is devoted to assess
the ability of our galaxy models in reproducing the SEDs of a few real galaxies
of the Local Universe.",2006-05-22T15:16:11Z
"Avoiding the Big-Rip Jeopardy in a Quintom Dark Energy Model with Higher
  Derivatives","In the framework of a single scalar field quintom model with higher
derivative, we construct in this paper a dark energy model of which the
equation of state (EOS) $w$ crosses over the cosmological constant boundary.
Interestingly during the evolution of the universe $w<-1$ happens just for a
period of time with a distinguished feature that $w$ starts with a value above
-1, transits into $w<-1$, then comes back to $w>-1$. This avoids the Big Rip
jeopardy induced by $w<-1$.",2006-03-30T16:26:14Z
"Non-Friedmann cosmology for the Local Universe, significance of the
  universal Hubble constant and short-distance indicators of dark energy","Basing on the increasing evidence for the cosmological relevance of the local
Hubble flow, we consider a simple analytical cosmological model for the Local
Universe. This is a non-Friedmann model with a non-uniform static space-time.
The major dynamical factor controlling the local expansion is the antigravity
produced by the omnipresent and permanent dark energy of the cosmic vacuum (or
the cosmological constant). The antigravity dominates at distances larger than
1-2 Mpc from the center of the Local Group. The model gives a natural
explanation of the two key quantitative characteristics of the local expansion
flow, which are the local Hubble constant and the velocity dispersion of the
flow. The observed kinematical similarity of the local and global flows of
expansion is clarified by the model. We demonstrate analytically the efficiency
of the vacuum cooling mechanism that allows one to see the Hubble flow so close
to the Local Group. Special significance is argued for the 'universal Hubble
constant' H_V, depending only on the vacuum density (H_V \approx 60 km/s/Mpc).
The model makes a number of testable predictions. It also shows unexpectedly
that it is the dwarf galaxies of the local flow with the shortest distances and
lowest redshifts that may be the most sensitive indicators of dark energy in
our neighborhood.",2006-03-09T08:32:43Z
"Cosmological Simulations of Intergalactic Medium Enrichment from
  Galactic Outflows","We investigate models of self-consistent chemical enrichment of the
intergalactic medium (IGM) from z=6 to 1.5, based on hydrodynamic simulations
of structure formation that incorporate galactic outflows. Our main result is
that outflow parameterizations based on momentum-driven winds as seen in local
starburst galaxies provide the best agreement with observations of CIV
absorption at z~2-5. Such models sufficiently enrich the high-z IGM to produce
a global mass density of CIV absorbers that is relatively invariant from z=5.5
to 1.5, in agreement with observations. This occurs despite an increase in the
volume-averaged metallicity by x5-10 over this redshift range, because energy
input from outflows causes a drop in the global ionization fraction of CIV.
Comparisons to observed CIV column density and linewidth distributions and
CIV-based pixel optical depth ratios provide significant constraints on wind
models. Our best-fitting models show mean IGM temperatures only slightly above
our no-outflow case, metal filling factors of just a few % with volume-weighted
metallicities around 0.001 at z~3, significant amounts of collisionally-ionized
CIV absorption, and a metallicity-density relationship that rises rapidly at
low overdensities and flattens at higher ones. In general, we find that outflow
speeds must be high enough to enrich the low-density IGM at early times but low
enough not to overheat it, and concurrently must significantly suppress early
star formation while still producing enough early metals. It is therefore
non-trivial that locally-calibrated momentum-driven wind scenarios naturally
yield the desired strength and evolution of outflows, and suggest that such
models represent a significant step towards understanding the impact of

Observations of the Crab Nebula with H.E.S.S,"The Crab nebula was observed with the H.E.S.S. stereoscopic
Cherenkov-telescope array between October 2003 and January 2005 for a total of
22.9 hours (after data quality selection). Observations were made with three
operational telescopes in late 2003 and with the complete 4 telescope array in
January - February 2004 and October 2004 - January 2005. The observations are
discussed and used as an example to detail the flux and spectral analysis
procedures of H.E.S.S., and to evaluate the systematic uncertainties in
H.E.S.S. flux measurements. The flux and spectrum of gamma-rays from the source
are calculated on run-by-run and monthly time-scales, and a correction is
applied for long-term variations in the detector sensitivity. Comparisons of
the measured flux and spectrum over the observation period, along with the
results from a number of different analysis procedures are used to estimate
systematic uncertainties in the measurements. The energy spectrum is found to
follow a power law with an exponential cutoff, with photon index $\Gamma = 2.39
\pm 0.03\stat$ and cutoff energy $E_{c} = (14.3 \pm 2.1\stat) \textrm{TeV}$
between 440 GeV and 40 TeV. The observed integral flux above 1 TeV is $(2.26
\pm 0.08\stat) \times 10^{-11} cm^{-2} s^{-1}$. The estimated systematic error
on the flux measurement is estimated to be 20%, while the estimated systematic
error on the spectral slope is 0.1.",2006-07-14T15:22:18Z
"Toward 1% Photometry: End-to-end Calibration of Astronomical Telescopes
  and Detectors","We review the systematic uncertainties that have plagued attempts to obtain
high precision and high accuracy from ground-based photometric measurements
using CCDs. We identify two main challenges in breaking through the 1%
precision barrier: 1) fully characterizing atmospheric transmission, along the
instrument's line of sight, and 2) properly identifying, measuring and removing
instrumental artifacts. We discuss approximations and limitations inherent in
the present methodology, and we estimate their contributions to systematic
photometric uncertainties. We propose an alternative conceptual scheme for the
relative calibration of astronomical apparatus: the availability of calibrated
detectors whose relative spectral sensitivity is known to better than one part
in $10^3$ opens up the possibility of in situ relative throughput measurements,
normalized to a precision calibrated detector, using a stable but uncalibrated
narrowband light source. An implementation scheme is outlined, which exploits
the availability of tunable lasers to map out the relative wavelength response
of an imaging system, using a flatfield screen and a calibrated reference
photodiode. The merits and limitations of this scheme are discussed. In tandem
with careful measurements of atmospheric transmission, this approach could
potentially lead to reliable ground-based photometry with fractional
uncertainties below the percent level.",2006-04-12T22:59:56Z
On the viability of holistic cosmic-ray source models,"We consider the energy spectrum of cosmic-rays (CRs) from a purely
phenomenological point of view and investigate the possibility that they all be
produced by the same type of sources with a single power-law spectrum, in
E^{-x}, from thermal to ultra-high energies. We show that the relative fluxes
of the Galactic (GCR) and extra-galactic (EGCR) components are compatible with
such a holistic model, provided that the index of the source spectrum be x
\simeq 2.23\pm 0.07. This is compatible with the best-fit indices for both GCRs
and EGCRs, assuming that their source composition is the same, which is indeed
the case in a holistic model. It is also compatible with theoretical
expectations for particle acceleration at relativistic shocks.",2006-05-01T23:06:41Z
Substructure around M31 : Evolution and Effects,"We investigate the evolution of a population of 100 dark matter satellites
orbiting in the gravitational potential of a realistic model of M31. We find
that after 10 Gyr, seven subhalos are completely disrupted by the tidal field
of the host galaxy. The remaining satellites suffer heavy mass loss and
overall, 75% of the mass initially in the subhalo system is tidally stripped.
Not surprisingly, satellites with pericentric radius less than 30 kpc suffer
the greatest stripping and leave a complex structure of tails and streams of
debris around the host galaxy. Assuming that the most bound particles in each
subhalo are kinematic tracers of stars, we find that the halo stellar
population resulting from the tidal debris follows an r^{-3.5} density profile
at large radii. We construct B-band photometric maps of stars coming from
disrupted satellites and find conspicuous features similar both in morphology
and brightness to the observed Giant Stream around Andromeda. An assumed star
formation efficiency of 5-10% in the simulated satellite galaxies results in
good agreement with the number of M31 satellites, the V-band surface brightness
distribution, and the brightness of the Giant Stream. During the first 5 Gyr,
the bombardment of the satellites heats and thickens the disk by a small
amount. At about 5 Gyr, satellite interations induce the formation of a strong
bar which, in turn, leads to a significant increase in the velocity dispersion
of the disk.",2006-06-01T02:15:46Z
Tidal Mass Loss from Collisionless Systems,"We examine the problem tidally-induced mass loss from collisionless systems
such as dark matter haloes. We develop a model for tidal mass loss, based upon
the phase space distribution of particles, which accounts for how both tidal
and Coriolis torques perturb the angular momentum of each particle in the
system. This allows us to study how both the density profile and velocity
anisotropy affect the degree of mass loss--we present basic results from such a
study. Our model predicts that mass loss is a continuous process even in a
static tidal field, a consequence of the fact that mass loss weakens the
potential of the system making it easier for further mass loss to occur. We
compare the predictions of our model with N-body simulations of idealized
systems in order to check its validity. We find reasonable agreement with the
N-body simulations except for in the case of very strong tidal fields, where
our results suggest that a higher-order perturbation analysis may be required.
The continuous tidally-induced mass loss predicted by our model can lead to
substantial reduction in satellite mass in cases where the traditional
treatment predicts no mass loss. As such, our results may have important
consequences for the orbits and survival of low mass satellites in dark matter
haloes.",2006-07-03T13:49:43Z
Primordial Black Hole Minimum Mass,"In this paper we revisit thermodynamic constraints on primordial black hole
(PBH) formation in the early universe. Under the assumption that PBH mass is
equal to the cosmological horizon mass, one can use the 2nd Law of
Thermodynamics to put a lower limit on the PBH mass. In models of PBH
formation, however, PBHs are created at some fraction of the horizon mass. We
show that this thermodynamic constraint still holds for sub-horizon PBH
formation.",2006-04-07T19:24:42Z

"Simulating the formation of molecular clouds. II. Rapid formation from
  turbulent initial conditions","(Abridged). In this paper, we present results from a large set of numerical
simulations that demonstrate that H2 formation occurs rapidly in turbulent gas.
Starting with purely atomic hydrogen, large quantities of molecular hydrogen
can be produced on timescales of 1 -- 2 Myr, given turbulent velocity
dispersions and magnetic field strengths consistent with observations.
Moreover, as our simulations underestimate the effectiveness of H2
self-shielding and dust absorption, we can be confident that the molecular
fractions that we compute are strong lower limits on the true values. The
formation of large quantities of H2 on the timescale required by rapid cloud
formation models therefore appears to be entirely plausible.
  We also investigate the density and temperature distributions of gas in our
model clouds. We show that the density probability distribution function is
approximately log-normal, with a dispersion that agrees well with the
prediction of Padoan, Nordlund & Jones (1997). The temperature distribution is
similar to that of a polytrope, with an effective polytropic index gamma_eff
\simeq 0.8, although at low gas densities, the scatter of the actual gas
temperature around this mean value is considerable, and the polytropic
approximation does not capture the full range of behaviour of the gas.",2006-05-04T10:13:09Z
"A Gravitational Instability-Driven Viscosity in Self-Gravitating
  Accretion Disks","We derive a viscosity from gravitational instability in self-gravitating
accretion disks, which has the required properties to account for the observed
fast formation of the first super-massive black holes in highly redshifted
quasars and for the cosmological evolution of the black hole-mass distribution.",2006-07-27T09:12:15Z
Instruments without optics: an integrated photonic spectrograph,"In recent years, a great deal of emphasis has been placed on achieving the
diffraction limit with large aperture telescopes. For a well matched
focal-plane instrument, the diffraction limit provides the highest possible
angular resolution and sensitivity per pixel. But it offers another key
advantage as we now show. Conventionally, as the telescope aperture D grows,
the instrument size grows in proportion to D, and cost increases as D^2 or
faster. However, an instrument that operates at the diffraction limit can break
the trend of spiralling costs. In traditional instruments, the light must pass
through a succession of large lenses, mirrors and gratings, making it difficult
to conserve the integrity of such as small psf. An alternative approach, as we
now show, is to couple the diffraction limited beam directly into an integrated
photonic spectrograph operating in low-order modes.",2006-06-13T02:04:10Z
"A Comprehensive Search for Gamma-Ray Lines in the First Year of Data
  from the INTEGRAL Spectrometer","We have carried out an extensive search for gamma-ray lines in the first year
of public data from the Spectrometer (SPI) on the INTEGRAL mission. INTEGRAL
has spent a large fraction of its observing time in the Galactic Plane with
particular concentration in the Galactic Center (GC) region (~ 3 Msec in the
first year). Hence the most sensitive search regions are in the Galactic Plane
and Center. The phase space of the search spans the energy range 20-8000 keV
and line widths from 0-1000 keV (FWHM). It includes both diffuse and point-like
emission. We have searched for variable emission on time scales down to ~ 1000
sec. Diffuse emission has been searched for on a range of different spatial
scales from ~ 20 deg (the approximate field-of-view of the spectrometer) up to
the entire Galactic Plane. Our search procedures were verified by the recovery
of the known gamma-ray lines at 511 keV and 1809 keV at the appropriate
intensities and significances. We find no evidence for any previously unknown
gamma-ray lines. The upper limits range from a few x 10^-5 cm^-2 s^-1 to a few
x 10^-2 cm^-2 s^-1 depending on line width, energy and exposure; regions of
strong instrumental background lines were excluded from the search. Comparison
is made between our results and various prior predictions of astrophysical
lines.",2006-04-12T17:44:35Z
"Quasar Luminosity Functions from Joint Evolution of Black Holes and Host
  Galaxies","We show that our previously proposed anti-hierarchical baryon collapse
scenario for the joint evolution of black holes and host galaxies predicts
quasar luminosity functions at redshifts 1.5<z<6 and local properties in nice
agreement with observations. In our model the quasar activity marks and
originates the transition between an earlier phase of violent and heavily
dust-enshrouded starburst activity promoting rapid black hole growth, and a
later phase of almost passive evolution; the former is traced by the
submillimeter-selected sources, while the latter accounts for the high number
density of massive galaxies at substantial redshifts z>1.5, the population of
Extremely Red Objects, and the properties of local ellipticals.",2006-03-30T13:09:33Z
"Contributions to the Nearby Stars (NStars) Project: Spectroscopy of
  Stars Earlier than M0 within 40 parsecs: The Southern Sample","We are obtaining spectra, spectral types and basic physical parameters for
the nearly 3600 dwarf and giant stars earlier than M0 in the Hipparcos catalog
within 40pc of the Sun. Here we report on results for 1676 stars in the
southern hemisphere observed at Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory and
Steward Observatory. These results include new, precise, homogeneous spectral
types, basic physical parameters (including the effective temperature, surface
gravity, and metallicity, [M/H]) and measures of the chromospheric activity of
our program stars. We include notes on astrophysically interesting stars in
this sample, the metallicity distribution of the solar neighborhood and a table
of solar analogues. We also demonstrate that the bimodal nature of the
distribution of the chromospheric activity parameter log R'HK depends strongly
on the metallicity, and we explore the nature of the ``low-metallicity''
chromospherically active K-type dwarfs.",2006-03-28T17:29:15Z
Baryonic loading and e^+e^- rate equation in GRB sources,"The expansion of the electron-positron plasma in the GRB phenomenon is
compared and contrasted in the treatments of Meszaros, Laguna and Rees, of
Shemi, Piran and Narayan, and of Ruffini et al. The role of the correct
numerical integration of the hydrodynamical equations, as well as of the rate
equation for the electron-positron plasma loaded with a baryonic mass, are
outlined and confronted for crucial differences.",2006-05-16T12:00:39Z
Generation of the magnetic field in jets,"We consider dynamo action under the combined influence of turbulence and
large-scale shear in sheared jets. Shear can stretch turbulent magnetic field
lines in such a way that even turbulent motions showing mirror symmetry become
suitable for generation of a large-scale magnetic field. We derive the integral
induction equation governing the behaviour of the mean field in jets. The main
result is that sheared jets may generate a large-scale magnetic field if shear
is sufficiently strong. The generated mean field is mainly concentrated in a
magnetic sheath surrounding the central region of a jet, and it exhibits sign
reversals in the direction of the jet axis. Typically, the magnetic field in a
sheath is dominated by the component along the jet that can reach equipartition
with the kinetic energy of particles, The field in the central region of jets
has a more disordered structure.",2006-05-22T14:20:15Z
Properties of galaxies in SDSS Quasar environments at z < 0.2,"We analyse the environment of low redshift, z < 0.2, SDSS quasars using the
spectral and photometric information of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey Third Data Release (SDSS-DR3). We compare quasar neighbourhoods with
field and high density environments through an analysis on samples of typical
galaxies and groups. We compute the surrounding surface number density of
galaxies finding that quasar environments systematically avoid high density
regions. Their mean environments correspond to galaxy density enhancements
similar to those of typical galaxies. We have also explored several galaxy
properties in these environments, such as spectral types, specific star
formation rates, concentration indexes, colours and active nuclei activity. We
conclude that low redshift quasar neighbourhoods (r_p < 1 Mpc h^-1, Delta V <
500 km/s) are populated by bluer and more intense star forming galaxies of
disk-type morphology than galaxies in groups and in the field. Although star
formation activity is thought to be significantly triggered by interactions, we
find that quasar fueling may not require the presence of a close companion
galaxy (r_p < 100 kpc h^-1, Delta V< 350 km/s). As a test of the unified AGN
model, we have performed a similar analysis to the neighbours of a sample of
active galaxies. The results indicate that these neighbourhoods are comparable
to those of quasars giving further support to this unified scenario.",2006-06-08T20:50:53Z
"Common Correlations between 60, 100 and 140 um Intensities in the
  Galactic Plane and Magellanic Clouds","We investigate the far-infrared SED of the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds
by using the COBE (COsmic Background Explorer) / DIRBE (Diffuse InfraRed
Background Experiment) ZSMA (Zodi - Subtracted Mission Average) maps at
wavelengths of 60 um, 100 um and 140 um. We analyze three regions: the Galactic
plane region with the Galactic latitude |b|<5 degree, the Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC) region, and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) region. Because the
dust optical depth is much smaller in the far-infrared than in the visible, we
may observe cumulative far-infrared radiation from regions with various
interstellar radiation field (IRSF) in a line of sight. As consequence of
considering such an effect, we find a common far-infrared color correlation
between the 140 - 100 um and 60 - 100 um intensity ratios in all the three
galaxies. Although this color correlation cannot be explained by any existing
model, it fits very well the far-infrared color of nearby star forming
galaxies.",2006-04-10T06:28:27Z
Do mean-field dynamos in nonrotating turbulent shear-flows exist?,"A plane-shear flow in a fluid with forced turbulence is considered. If the
fluid is electrically-conducting then a mean electromotive force (EMF) results
even without basic rotation and the magnetic diffusivity becomes a highly
anisotropic tensor. It is checked whether in this case self-excitation of a
large-scale magnetic field is possible (so-called WxJ-dynamo) and the answer is
NO. The calculations reveal the cross-stream components of the EMF
perpendicular to the mean current having the wrong signs, at least for small
magnetic Prandtl numbers. After our results numerical simulations with magnetic
Prandtl number of about unity have only a restricted meaning as the Prandtl
number dependence of the diffusivity tensor is rather strong. If, on the other
hand, the turbulence field is stratified in the vertical direction then a
dynamo active alpha-effect is produced. The critical magnetic Reynolds number
for such a self-excitation in a simple shear flow is slightly above 10 like for
the other - but much more complicated - flow patterns used in existing dynamo
experiments with liquid sodium or gallium.",2006-04-18T10:25:14Z
"Energy input and response from prompt and early optical afterglow
  emission in gamma-ray bursts","The taxonomy of optical emission detected during the critical first few
minutes after the onset of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) defines two broad classes:
prompt optical emission correlated with prompt gamma-ray emission, and early
optical afterglow emission uncorrelated with the gamma-ray emission. The
standard theoretical interpretation attributes prompt emission to internal
shocks in the ultra-relativistic outflow generated by the internal engine;
early afterglow emission is attributed to shocks generated by interaction with
the surrounding medium. Here we report on observations of a bright GRB that,
for the first time, clearly show the temporal relationship and relative
strength of the two optical components. The observations indicate that early
afterglow emission can be understood as reverberation of the energy input
measured by prompt emission. Measurements of the early afterglow reverberations
therefore probe the structure of the environment around the burst, whereas the
subsequent response to late-time impulsive energy releases reveals how earlier
flaring episodes have altered the jet and environment parameters. Many GRBs are
generated by the death of massive stars that were born and died before the
Universe was ten per cent of its current age, so GRB afterglow reverberations
provide clues about the environments around some of the first stars.",2006-05-18T20:40:40Z
A Reverberation-Based Mass for the Central Black Hole in NGC 4151,"We have undertaken a new ground-based monitoring campaign to improve the
estimates of the mass of the central black hole in NGC 4151. We measure the lag
time of the broad H beta line response compared to the optical continuum at
5100 A and find a lag of 6.6 (+1.1/-0.8) days. We combine our data with the
recent reanalysis of UV emission lines by Metzroth et al. to calculate a
weighted mean of the black hole mass, M_BH = 4.57 (+0.57/-0.47) x 10^7 M_sun.
The absolute calibration of the black hole mass is based on normalization of
the AGN black hole mass - stellar velocity dispersion (M_BH - sigma_*)
relationship to that of quiescent galaxies by Onken et al. The scatter in the
M_BH - sigma_* relationship suggests that reverberation-mapping based mass
measurements are typically uncertain by a factor of 3-4.",2006-07-05T20:01:36Z
"MHD versus kinetic effects in the solar coronal heating: a two stage
  mechanism","Using Particle-In-Cell simulations i.e. in the kinetic plasma description the
discovery of a new mechanism of parallel electric field generation was recently
reported. Here we show that the electric field generation parallel to the
uniform unperturbed magnetic field can be obtained in a much simpler framework
using the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) description. In ideal MHD the
electric field parallel to the uniform unperturbed magnetic field appears due
to fast magnetosonic waves which are generated by the interaction of weakly
non-linear Alfv\'en waves with the transverse density inhomogeneity. In the
context of the coronal heating problem a new {\it two stage mechanism} of
plasma heating is presented by putting emphasis, first, on the generation of
parallel electric fields within an {\it ideal MHD} description directly, rather
than focusing on the enhanced dissipation mechanisms of the Alfv\'en waves and,
second, dissipation of these parallel electric fields via {\it kinetic}
effects. It is shown that for a single Alfv\'en wave harmonic with frequency
$\nu = 7$ Hz, and longitudinal wavelength $\lambda_A = 0.63$ Mm for a putative
Alfv\'en speed of 4328 km s$^{-1}$, the generated parallel electric field could
account for 10% of the necessary coronal heating requirement. We conjecture
that wide spectrum (10$^{-4}-10^3$ Hz) Alfv\'en waves, based on the
observationally constrained spectrum, could provide the necessary coronal
heating requirement. By comparing MHD versus kinetic results we also show that
there is a clear indication of the {\it anomalous resistivity} which is 100s of
times greater than the classical Braginskii value.",2006-06-27T14:44:51Z
"Spitzer 4.5 micron Luminosity-Metallicity and Mass-Metallicity Relations
  for Nearby Dwarf Irregular Galaxies","For a sample of 25 dwarf irregular galaxies with distances D < 5 Mpc and
measured oxygen abundances, we present results derived from stellar masses and
galaxy luminosities from near-infrared imaging with IRAC on the Spitzer Space
Telescope. We have constructed the appropriate luminosity-metallicity (L-Z) and
mass-metallicity (M-Z) relations, and compared these relations with their
corresponding relations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We obtain the
following results. 1. The dispersion in the near-infrared L-Z relation is
reduced with respect to the dispersion in the optical L-Z relation, which
agrees with expectations for reduced variations of stellar mass-to-light ratios
at longer wavelengths compared to optical wavelengths. 2. The dispersion in the
optical L-Z relation is similar over approximately 11 mag in optical
luminosity. 3. With our constructed M-Z relation, we have extended the SDSS M-Z
relation to lower masses by about 2.5 dex in stellar mass. 4. The dispersion in
the M-Z relation appears to be comparable over a range of 5.5 dex in stellar
mass.",2006-03-27T20:54:59Z
Optical recombination lines as probes of conditions in planetary nebulae,"Since the last IAU symposium on planetary nebulae (PNe), several deep
spectroscopic surveys of the relatively faint optical recombination lines
(ORLs) emitted by heavy element ions in PNe and H II regions have been
completed. New diagnostic tools have been developed thanks to progress in the
calculations of basic atomic data. Together, they have led to a better
understanding of the physical conditions under which the various types of
emission lines arise. The studies have strengthened the previous conjecture
that nebulae contain another component of cold, high metallicity gas, which is
too cool to excite any significant optical or UV CELs and is thus invisible via
such lines. The existence of such a plasma component in PNe and possibly also
in H II regions provides a natural solution to the long-standing problem in
nebular astrophysics, i.e. the dichotomy of nebular plasma diagnostics and
abundance determinations using ORLs and continua on the one hand and
collisionally excited lines (CELs) on the other.",2006-05-03T08:21:28Z
"Distinguishing Propagation vs. Launch Physics of Astrophysical Jets and
  the Role of Experiments","The absence of other viable momentum sources for collimated flows leads to
the likelihood that magnetic fields play a fundamental role in jet launch
and/or collimation in astrophysical jets. To best understand the physics of
jets, it is useful to distinguish between the launch region where the jet is
accelerated and the larger scales where the jet propagates as a collimated
structure. Observations presently resolve jet propagation, but not the launch
region. Simulations typically probe the launch and propagation regions
separately, but not both together. Here, I identify some of the physics of jet
launch vs. propagation and what laboratory jet experiments to date have probed.
Reproducing an astrophysical jet in the lab is unrealistic, so maximizing the
benefit of the experiments requires clarifying the astrophysical connection.",2006-06-28T06:41:43Z
Exotic bulk viscosity and its influence on neutron star r-modes,"We investigate the effect of exotic matter in particular, hyperon matter on
neutron star properties such as equation of state (EoS), mass-radius
relationship and bulk viscosity. Here we construct equations of state within
the framework of a relativistic field theoretical model. As hyperons are
produced abundantly in dense matter, hyperon-hyperon interaction becomes
important and is included in this model. Hyperon-hyperon interaction gives rise
to a softer EoS which results in a smaller maximum mass neutron star compared
with the case without the interaction. Next we compute the coefficient of bulk
viscosity and the corresponding damping time scale due to the non-leptonic weak
process including $\Lambda$ hyperons. Further, we investigate the role of the
bulk viscosity on gravitational radiation driven r-mode instability in a
neutron star of given mass and temperature and find that the instability is
effectively suppressed.",2006-07-01T11:59:48Z
"Discovery of a cluster of galaxies behind the Milky Way: X-ray and
  optical observations","We report the discovery of Cl 2334+48, a rich cluster of galaxies in the Zone
of Avoidance, identified in public images from the XMM-Newton archive. We
present the main properties of this cluster using the XMM-Newton X-ray data,
along with new optical spectroscopic and photometric observations. Cl 2334+48
is located at z = 0.271 +/- 0.001, as derived from the optical spectrum of the
brightest member galaxy. Such redshift agrees with a determination from the
X-ray spectrum (z = 0.263 (+0.012/-0.010)), in which an intense emission line
is matched to the rest wavelength of the Fe Kalpha complex. Its intracluster
medium has a plasma temperature of 4.92 (+0.50/-0.48) keV, sub-solar abundance
(0.38 +/- 0.12 Zsun), and a bolometric luminosity of 3.2 x 10^44 erg/s. A
density contrast delta = 2500 is obtained in a radius of 0.5 Mpc/h70, and the
corresponding enclosed mass is 1.5 x 10^14 Msun. Optical images show an
enhancement of g'-i' > 2.5 galaxies around the central galaxy, as expected if
these were cluster members. The central object is a luminous E-type galaxy,
which is displaced ~ 40 kpc/h70 from the cluster X-ray center. In addition, it
has a neighbouring arc-like feature (~ 22"" or 90 kpc/h70 from it), probably due
to strong gravitational lensing. The discovery of Cl 2334+48 emphasises the
remarkable capability of the XMM-Newton to reveal new clusters of galaxies in
the Zone of Avoidance.",2006-06-15T18:22:34Z
"Detection of Highly Ionized Metal Absorption Lines in the Ultracompact
  X-ray Dipper 4U 1916-05","We present the high-resolution Chandra X-ray Observatory persistent (non-dip)
spectrum of 4U 1916-05 which revealed narrow absorption lines from hydrogenic
neon, magnesium, silicon, and sulfur, in addition to the previous identified
hydrogenic and helium-like iron absorption lines. This makes 4U 1916-05 only
the second of the classical X-ray dipper systems to show narrow absorption
lines from elements other than iron. We propose two possible explanations for
the small measured line widths (>~ 500-2000 km s^{-1}), compared to the
expected Keplerian velocities (> 1000 km s^{-1}) of the accretion disk in this
50-min orbital period system, and lack of wavelength shifts (>~ 250 km s^{-1}).
First, the ionized absorber may be stationary. Alternatively, the line
properties may measure the relative size of the emission region. From this
hypothesis, we find that the emission region is constrained to be >~ 0.25 times
the radial extent of the absorber. Our results also imply that the ionized
absorber spans a range of ionization parameters.",2006-04-03T21:16:47Z
"Modelling the closest double degenerate system RXJ0806.3+1527 and its
  decreasing period","In the hypothesis that the 5.4m binary RXJ0806.3+1527 consists of a low mass
helium white dwarf (donor) transferring mass towards its more massive white
dwarf companion (primary), we consider as possible donors white dwarfs which
are the result of common envelope evolution occurring when the helium core mass
of the progenitor giant was still very small (~ 0.2Msun), so that they are
surrounded by a quite massive hydrogen envelope (~1/100Msun or larger), and
live for a very long time supported by proton--proton burning. Mass transfer
from such low mass white dwarfs very probably starts during the hydrogen
burning stage, and the donor structure will remain dominated by the burning
shell until it loses all the hydrogen envelope and begins transferring helium.
We model mass transfer from these low mass white dwarfs, and show that the
radius of the donor decreases while they shed the hydrogen envelope. This
radius behavior, which is due to the fact that the white dwarf is not fully
degenerate, has two important consequences on the evolution of the binary: 1)
the orbital period decreases, with a timescale consistent with the period
decrease of the binary RXJ0806.3+1527; 2) the mass transfer rate is a factor of
about 10 smaller than from a fully degenerate white dwarf, easing the problem
connected with the small X-ray luminosity of this object. The possibility that
such evolution describes the system RXJ0806.3+1527 is also consistent with the
possible presence of hydrogen in the optical spectrum of the star, whose
confirmation would become a test of the model.",2006-06-23T06:18:04Z
"An Outbursting Protostar of the FU~Orionis type in the Cygnus OB7
  Molecular Cloud","Context: To follow the early evolution of stars we need to understand how
young stars accrete and eject mass. It is generally assumed that the FU Orionis
phenomenon is related to the variations in the disk accretion, but many
questions remain still open, in particular because of the rarity of FU Ori type
stars.
  Aims: We explore here the characteristics of the outburst and of the
environment of one new object, discovered recently in the in the active star
formation region containing RNO127, within the Cygnus OB7 dark cloud complex.
  Methods: We present an extensive optical and near-infrared study of a new
candidate of FU Orionis object, including its direct imaging, spectroscopy and
scanning Fabry-Perot interferometry.
  Results: The source, associated with the variable reflection nebula,
underwent prodigious outburst. The ""Braid"" nebula, which appeared in 2000, as
is indicated by its name, consists of two intertwined features, illuminated by
the outburst. Subsequent NIR observations revealed the bright source, which was
not visible on 2MASS images, and its estimated brightening was more than 4
magnitudes. Optical and infrared spectral data show features, which are
necessary for the system to be referred to as a FUor object. The bipolar
optical flow directed by the axis of nebula also was found. Various estimates
give the November/December 1999 as the most probable date for the eruption.",2006-05-19T16:27:48Z
Near-Horizon Solution for DGP Perturbations,"We develop a scaling ansatz for the master equation in Dvali, Gabadadze,
Porrati cosmologies, which allows us to solve the equations of motion for
perturbations off the brane during periods when the on-brane evolution is
scale-free. This allows us to understand the behavior of the gravitational
potentials outside the horizon at high redshifts and close to the horizon
today. We confirm that the results of Koyama and Maartens are valid at scales
relevant for observations such as galaxy-ISW correlation. At larger scales,
there is an additional suppression of the potential which reduces the growth
rate even further and would strengthen the ISW effect.",2006-06-13T00:53:26Z
Photometric study of selected cataclysmic variables,"We present time-resolved photometry of five relatively poorly-studied
cataclysmic variables: V1193 Ori, LQ Peg, LD 317, V795 Her, and MCT 2347-3144.
The observations were made using four 1m-class telescopes for a total of more
than 250 h of observation and almost 16,000 data points. For LQ Peg WHT
spectroscopic data have been analysed as well.
  The light curves show a wide range of variability on different time scales
from minutes to months. We detect for the first time a brightness variation of
0.05 mag in amplitude in V1193 Ori on the same timescale as the orbital period,
which we interpret as the result of the irradiation of the secondary. A 20-min
quasi-periodic oscillation is also detected. The mean brightness of the system
has changed by 0.5 mag on a three-month interval, while the flickering was
halved. In LQ Peg a 0.05 mag modulation was revealed with a period of about 3
h. The flickering was much smaller, of the order of 0.025 mag. A possible
quasi-periodic oscillation could exist near 30 min. For this object, the WHT
spectra are single-peaked and do not show any radial-velocity variations. The
data of LD 317 show a decrease in the mean magnitude of the system. No periodic
signal was detected but this is certainly attributable to the very large
flickering observed: between 0.07 and 0.1 mag. For V795 Her, the 2.8-hour
modulation, thought to be a superhump arising from the precession of the disc,
is present. We show that this modulation is not stable in terms of periodicity,
amplitude, and phase. Finally, for MCT 2347-3144, a clear modulation is seen in
a first dataset obtained in October 2002. This modulation is absent in August
2003, when the system was brighter and showed much more flickering.",2006-05-05T16:35:26Z
"An asymmetric shock wave in the 2006 outburst of the recurrent nova RS
  Ophiuchi","Nova outbursts take place in binary star systems comprising a white dwarf and
either a low-mass Sun-like star or, as in the case of the recurrent nova RS
Ophiuchi, a red giant. Although the cause of these outbursts is known to be
thermonuclear explosion of matter transferred from the companion onto the
surface of the white dwarf, models of the previous (1985) outburst of RS
Ophiuchi failed to adequately fit the X-ray evolution and there was controversy
over a single-epoch high-resolution radio image, which suggested that the
remnant was bipolar rather than spherical as modelled. Here we report the
detection of spatially resolved structure in RS Ophiuchi from two weeks after
its 12 February 2006 outburst. We track an expanding shock wave as it sweeps
through the red giant wind, producing a remnant similar to that of a type II
supernova but evolving over months rather than millennia. As in supernova
remnants, the radio emission is non-thermal (synchrotron emission), but
asymmetries and multiple emission components clearly demonstrate that contrary
to the assumptions of spherical symmetry in models of the 1985 explosion, the
ejection is jet-like, collimated by the central binary whose orientation on the
sky can be determined from these observations.",2006-06-09T09:08:17Z
Measurability of vacuum fluctuations and dark energy,"Vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field induce current fluctuations
in resistively shunted Josephson junctions that are measurable in terms of a
physical power spectrum. In this paper we investigate under which conditions
vacuum fluctuations can be gravitationally active, thus contributing to the
dark energy density of the universe. Our central hypothesis is that vacuum
fluctuations are gravitationally active if and only if they are measurable in
terms of a physical power spectrum in a suitable macroscopic or mesoscopic
detector. This hypothesis is consistent with the observed dark energy density
in the universe and offers a resolution of the cosmological constant problem.
Using this hypothesis we show that the observable vacuum energy density rho_vac
in the universe is related to the largest possible critical temperature T_c of
superconductors through rho_vac = sigma (kT_c)^4/(hbar^3 c^3), where sigma is a
small constant of the order 10^-3. This relation can be regarded as an analog
of the Stefan-Boltzmann law for dark energy. Our hypothesis is testable in
Josephson junctions where we predict there should be a cutoff in the measured
spectrum at 1.7 THz if the hypothesis is true.",2006-05-17T15:43:25Z
"Confirmation of the Planet Hypothesis for the Long-period Radial
  Velocity Variations of Beta Geminorum","We present precise stellar radial velocity measurements for the K giant star
Beta Gem spanning over 25 years. These data show that the long period low
amplitude radial velocity variations found by Hatzes & Cochran (1993) are
long-lived and coherent. An examination of the Ca II K emission, spectral line
shapes from high resolution data (R = 210,000), and Hipparcos photometry show
no significant variations of these quantities with the RV period. These data
confirm the planetary companion hypothesis suggested by Hatzes & Cochran
(1993). An orbital solution assuming a stellar mass of 1.7 M_sun yields a
period, P = 589.6 days, a minimum mass of 2.3 M_Jupiter, and a semi-major axis,
and a = 1.6 AU. The orbit is nearly circular (e = 0.02). Beta Gem is the
seventh intermediate mass star shown to host a sub-stellar companion and
suggests that planet-formation around stars much more massive than the sun may
common.",2006-06-21T12:43:24Z
"Atmospheric Circulation of Close-In Extrasolar Giant Planets: I. Global,
  Barotropic, Adiabatic Simulations","We present results from a set of over 300 pseudospectral simulations of
atmospheric circulation on extrasolar giant planets with circular orbits. The
simulations are of high enough resolution (up to 341 total and sectoral modes)
to resolve small-scale eddies and waves, required for reasonable physical
accuracy. In this work, we focus on the global circulation pattern that emerges
in a shallow, ``equivalent-barotropic'', turbulent atmosphere on both tidally
synchronized and unsynchronized planets. A full exploration of the large
physical and numerical parameter-space is performed to identify robust features
of the circulation. For some validation, the model is first applied to Solar
System giant planets. For extrasolar giant planets with physical parameters
similar to HD209458b--a presumably synchronized extrasolar giant planet,
representative in many dynamical respects--the circulation is characterized by
the following features: 1) a coherent polar vortex that revolves around the
pole in each hemisphere; 2) a low number--typically two or three--of
slowly-varying, broad zonal (east-west) jets that form when the maximum jet
speed is comparable to, or somewhat stronger than, those observed on the
planets in the Solar System; and, 3) motion-associated temperature field, whose
detectability and variability depend on the strength of the net heating rate
and the global root mean square wind speed in the atmosphere. In many ways, the
global circulation is Earth-like, rather than Jupiter-like. However, if
extrasolar giant planets rotate faster and are not close-in (therefore not
synchronized), their circulations become more Jupiter-like, for Jupiter-like
rotation rates.",2006-07-14T16:27:37Z
"VI Photometry of Globular Clusters NGC6293 and NGC6541: The Formation of
  the Metal-Poor Inner Halo Globular Clusters","We present VI photometry of the metal-poor inner halo globular clusters
NGC6293 and NGC6541 using the planetary camera of the WFPC2 on board HST. Our
color-magnitude diagrams of the clusters show well-defined BHB populations,
consistent with their low metallicities and old ages. NGC6293 appears to have
blue straggler stars in the cluster's central region. We discuss the
interstellar reddening and the distance modulus of NGC6293 and NGC6541 and
obtain E(B-V) = 0.40 and (m-M)_0 = 14.61 for NGC6293 and E(B-V) = 0.14 and
(m-M)_0 = 14.19 for NGC6541. Our results confirm that NGC6293 and NGC6541 are
clearly located in the Galaxy's central regions (R_{GC} < 3 kpc). We also
discuss the differential reddening across NGC6293. The interstellar reddening
value of NGC6293 appears to vary by Delta E(B-V) ~ 0.02 -- 0.04 mag within our
small field of view.
  The most notable result of our study is that the inner halo clusters NGC6293
and NGC6541 essentially have the same ages as M92, confirming the previous
result from the HST NIC3 observations of NGC6287.",2006-06-29T08:37:56Z
Cosmic ray feedback in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation,"It is well known that cosmic rays (CRs) contribute significantly to the
pressure of the interstellar medium in our own Galaxy, suggesting that they may
play an important role in regulating star formation during the formation and
evolution of galaxies. We here discuss a novel numerical treatment of the
physics of CRs and its implementation in the parallel smoothed particle
hydrodynamics code GADGET-2. In our methodology, the non-thermal CR population
of each gaseous fluid element is approximated by a simple power law spectrum in
particle momentum, characterized by an amplitude, a cut-off, and a fixed slope.
Adiabatic compression, and a number of physical source and sink terms are
modelled which modify the CR pressure of each particle. The most important
sources considered are injection by supernovae and diffusive shock
acceleration, while the primary sinks are thermalization by Coulomb
interactions, and catastrophic losses by hadronic interactions. We also include
diffusion of CRs. Our scheme allows us to carry out the first cosmological
structure formation simulations that self-consistently account for CR physics.
In simulations of isolated galaxies, we find that CRs can significantly reduce
the star formation efficiencies of small galaxies, with virial velocities below
\~80 km/s, an effect that becomes progressively stronger towards low mass
scales. In cosmological simulations at high redshift, the total mass-to-light
ratio of small halos and the faint-end of the luminosity function are strongly
affected. When CR acceleration in shocks is followed as well, up to ~40% of the
energy dissipated at structure formation shocks can appear as CR pressure at
z~3-6, but this fraction drops to ~10% at low redshifts when the shock
distribution becomes increasingly dominated by lower Mach numbers. (abridged)",2006-03-19T23:41:09Z
"Gravity, Dimension, Equilibrium, & Thermodynamics","Is it actually possible to interpret gravitation as space's property in a
pure classical way. Then, we note that extended self-gravitating system
equilibrium depends directly on the number of dimension of the space in which
it evolves. Given those precisions, we review the principal thermodynamical
knowledge in the context of classical gravity with arbitrary dimension of
space. Stability analyses for bounded 3D systems, namely the Antonov
instability paradigm, are then rapproched to some amazing properties of
globular clusters and galaxies.",2006-03-30T07:11:53Z
The recent star formation in NGC 6822 from HST imaging,"We present HST WFPC2 and STIS imaging of the low metallicity galaxy NGC 6822,
performed as part of a study of the young stellar populations in the galaxies
of the Local Group. Eleven WFPC2 pointings, with some overlap, cover two
regions, extending over 19'x19' and 13'x13' respectively, off the galaxy
center. One 25x25'' field observed with STIS' FUV- and NUV- MAMA, includes
Hodge's OB8 association and the HII region Hubble V. We derive the physical
parameters of the stars in the fields and the extinction by comparing the
photometry to grids of model magnitudes. The environments studied in this work
include one of the most luminous (in Halpha) HII regions in the Local Group
(Hubble V) with a compact star cluster, a typical OB association (OB15), the
sparse field population and the outskirts of NGC6822. The color-magnitude
diagrams show similar ages of few Myrs for both OB8 and OB15. The density [per
unit area] of hot massive stars in the core of the OB8 association is higher
than in OB15 by a factor of 12, while the total stellar mass formed is similar.
In both OB15 and OB8 massive star candidates are found. The average extinction
is found to vary among the three environments studied: E(B-V) = 0.22 in the
outer regions, E(B-V) = 0.27 in the fields East of the galaxy main bar, and
E(B-V) = 0.40 in the HII region Hubble V. A quantitative discussion of the
applicability of the reddening-free-index method for photometric determination
of stellar parameters is provided for the filters used in this work, based on
our grids of stellar models.",2006-05-14T21:27:39Z
"Cooling of the quasi-persistent neutron star X-ray transients KS
  1731-260 and MXB 1659-29","We present Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observations that monitor the neutron
star cooling of the quasi-persistent neutron star X-ray transients KS 1731-260
and MXB 1659-29 for approximately 4 years after these sources returned to
quiescence from prolonged outbursts. In both sources the outbursts were long
enough to significantly heat the neutron star crust out of thermal equilibrium
with the core. We analyse the X-ray spectra by fitting absorbed neutron star
atmosphere models to the observations. The results of our analysis strengthen
the preliminary findings of Wijnands et al. that in both sources the neutron
star crust cools down very rapidly suggesting it has a high heat conductivity
and that the neutron star core requires enhanced core cooling processes.
Importantly, we now detect the flattening of the cooling in both sources as the
crust returns to thermal equilibrium with the core. We measure the thermal
equilbrium flux and temperature in both sources by fitting a curve that decays
exponentially to a constant level. The cooling curves cannot be fit with just a
simple exponential decay without the constant offset. We find the constant
bolometric flux and effective temperature components to be (9.2 +/- 0.9)E-14
ergs/cm^2/s and 70.0 +/- 1.6 eV in KS 1731-260 and (1.7 +/- 0.3)E-14
ergs/cm^2/s and 51.6 +/- 1.4 eV in MXB 1659-29. In addition, we find that the
crust of KS 1731-260 cools faster than that of MXB 1659-29 by a factor of ~2,
likely due to different crustal properties. This is the first time that the
cooling of a neutron star crust into thermal equilibrium with the core has been
observed in such detail.",2006-05-19T11:19:46Z
"Dynamical Formation of Close Binaries in Globular Clusters II:
  Cataclysmic Variables","We answer the long-standing question of which production mechanism is
responsible for the cataclysmic variables (CVs) in globular clusters. Arguments
have been given that range from mostly primordial presence to a significant
contribution of later dynamical formation in close stellar encounters. We
conclude, based on a thorough analysis of a homogeneous {\it Chandra} data set,
that the majority of CVs in globulars has a dynamical origin.",2006-05-02T00:40:29Z
"The superimposed photospheric and stellar wind variability of the O-type
  supergiant alpha Cam","(Abridged) We provide empirical constraints on the different physical
components that can act to yield temporal variability in predominantly or
partially wind-formed optical lines of luminous OB stars, and thus potentially
affect the reliable determination of fundamental parameters, including
mass-loss rates via clumped winds. Using time-series spectroscopy from epochs
spread over $\sim$ 4 years, a case study of the O9.5 supergiant $\alpha$ Cam is
presented. We demonstrate that the He I 5876 (2$^3$P$^0$--3$^3$D) line is an
important diagnostic for photospheric and wind variability in this star. The
optical line profiles of $\alpha$ Cam are affected by (i) deep-seated
fluctuations close to, or at, the photosphere, (ii) atmospheric velocity
gradients, and (iii) large-scale stellar wind structure. This study provides
new empirical perspectives on accurate line-synthesis modelling of stellar wind
signatures in massive luminous stars. Using a pure Halpha line-synthesis code
we interpret maximum changes in the red-ward and peak emission of $\alpha$ Cam
in terms of mass-loss rate differences in the range $\sim$ 5.1 $\times$
10$^{-6}$ to 6.5 $\times$ 10$^{-6}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. However, the models
generally fail to reproduce the morphology of blueward (possibly absorptive)
regions of the profiles.",2006-06-29T13:15:48Z
"Clumpiness of Dark Matter and Positron Annihilation Signal: Computing
  the odds of the Galactic Lottery","The small-scale distribution of dark matter in Galactic halos is poorly
known. Several studies suggest that it could be very clumpy, which turns out to
be of paramount importance when investigating the annihilation signal from
exotic particles (e.g. supersymmetric or Kaluza-Klein). In this paper we focus
on the annihilation signal in positrons. We estimate the associated
uncertainty, due to the fact that we do not know exactly how the clumps are
distributed in the Galactic halo. To this aim, we perform a statistical study
based on analytical computations, as well as numerical simulations. In
particular, we study the average and variance of the annihilation signal over
many Galactic halos having the same statistical properties. We find that the
so-called boost factor used by many authors should be handled with care, as i)
it depends on energy and ii) it may be different for positrons, antiprotons and
gamma rays, a fact which has not received any attention before. As an
illustration, we use our results to discuss the positron spectrum measurements
by the HEAT experiment.",2006-03-29T17:28:06Z
Determining the H+ Region/PDR Equation of State in Star Forming Regions,"The emission line regions of starburst galaxies and active nuclei reveal a
wealth of spectroscopic information. A unified picture of the relationship
between ionized, atomic, and molecular gas makes it possible to better
understand these observations. We performed a series of calculations designed
to determine the equation of state, the relationship between density,
temperature, and pressure, through emission-line diagnostic ratios that form in
the H+ region and PDR. We consider a wide range of physical conditions in the
H+ region. We connect the H+ region to the PDR by considering two constant
pressure cases, one with no magnetic field and one where the magnetic field
overwhelms the thermal pressure. We show that diagnostic ratios can yield the
equation of state for single H+ regions adjacent to single PDRs, with the
results being more ambiguous when considering observations of entire galaxies.
As a test, we apply our calculations to the Orion H+/PDR region behind the
Trapezium. We find the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure in the PDR to be
\~1.2. If magnetic and turbulent energy are in equipartition, our results mean
the magnetic field is not the cause of the unexplained broadening in M 42, but
may significantly affect line broadening in the PDR. Since Orion is often used
to understand physical processes in extragalactic environments, our
calculations suggest magnetic pressure should be considered in modeling such
regions.",2006-04-10T16:34:51Z
APEX mapping of H3O+ in the Sgr B2 region,"The cosmic-ray ionization rate (zeta) of dense molecular clouds is a key
parameter for their dynamics and chemistry. Variations of zeta are well
established, but it is unclear if these are related to source column density or
to Galactic location. Using the APEX telescope, we have mapped the 364 GHz line
of H3O+ in the Sgr B2 region and observed the 307 GHz line at selected
positions. With the IRAM 30-m telescope we have observed the 203 GHz line of
H2O-18 at the same positions. Strong H3O+ emission is detected over a ~3x2 pc
region, indicating H3O+ column densities of 10^15 - 10^16 cm^-2 in an 18"" beam.
The H3O+ abundance of ~3 x 10^-9 and H3O+/H2O ratio of ~1/50 in the Sgr B2
envelope are consistent with models with zeta ~4 x 10^-16 s^-1, 3x lower than
derived from H3+ observations toward Sgr A, but 10x that of local dense clouds.
The ionization rates of interstellar clouds thus seem to be to first order
determined by the ambient cosmic-ray flux, while propagation effects cause a
factor of ~3 decrease from diffuse to dense clouds.",2006-05-23T08:29:28Z
"Bright OB stars in the Galaxy - III. Constraints on the radial
  stratification of the clumping factor in hot star winds from a combined
  Halpha, IR and radio analysis","Recent results strongly challenge the canonical picture of massive star
winds: various evidence indicates that currently accepted mass-loss rates,
Mdot, may need to be revised downwards significantly. This is because the most
commonly used mass-loss diagnostics are affected by ``clumping'' (small-scale
density inhomogeneities), influencing our interpretation of observed spectra
and fluxes. Such downward revisions would have dramatic consequences for the
evolution of, and feedback from, massive stars, and thus robust determinations
of the clumping properties and mass-loss rates are urgently needed. Here, we
present a first attempt to constrain the radial stratification of the so-called
clumping factor. To this end, we have analyzed a sample of 19 Galactic O-type
supergiants/giants, by combining data for Halpha, IR, mm and radio fluxes, and
using appropriate analysis methods. Clumping has been included into our
analysis in the ``conventional'' way, by assuming the inter-clump matter to be
void. Because (almost) all our diagnostics depends on the square of density, we
cannot derive absolute clumping factors, but only factors normalized to a
certain minimum. This minimum was usually found to be located in the outermost,
radio-emitting region, i.e., the radio mass-loss rates are the lowest ones,
compared to Mdot derived from Halpha and the IR. The radio rates agree well
with those predicted by theory, but are only upper limits, due to unknown
clumping in the outer wind. Our most important result concerns a (physical)
difference between denser and thinner winds: for denser winds, the innermost
region is more strongly clumped than the outermost one (with a normalized
clumping factor of 4.1+/-1.4), whereas thinner winds have similar clumping
properties in the inner and outer regions.",2006-04-18T06:25:54Z
QSO Absorption Lines from QSOs,"We present the results of a search for metal absorption lines in the spectra
of background QSOs whose sightlines pass close to foreground QSOs. We detect
MgII(2796,2803) absorption in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra of four
z>1.5 QSOs whose lines of sight pass within 26-98 kpc of lower redshift
(z~0.5-1.5) QSOs. The 100% [4/4 pairs] detection of MgII in the background QSOs
is clearly at odds with the incidence of associated (z_abs ~ z_em) systems --
absorbers which exist towards only a few percent of QSOs. Although the quality
of our foreground QSO spectra is not as high as the SDSS data, absorption seen
towards one of the background QSOs clearly does not show up at the same
strength in the spectrum of the corresponding foreground QSO. This implies that
the absorbing gas is distributed inhomogeneously around the QSO, presumably as
a direct consequence of the anisotropic emission from the central AGN. We
discuss possible origins for the MgII lines, including: absorption by gas from
the foreground QSO host galaxy; companion galaxies fuelling the QSO through
gravitational interactions; and tidal debris left by galaxy mergers or
interactions which initiated the QSO activity. No single explanation is
entirely satisfactory, and we may well be seeing a mixture of phenomena.",2006-05-30T21:00:46Z
Exploring the spectroscopic diversity of Type Ia Supernovae,"The velocities and equivalent widths (EWs) of a set of absorption features
are measured for a sample of 28 well-observed Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia)
covering a wide range of properties. The values of these quantities at maximum
are obtained through interpolation/extrapolation and plotted against the
decline rate, and so are various line ratios. The SNe are divided according to
their velocity evolution into three classes defined in a previous work of
Benetti et al.: low velocity gradient (LVG), high velocity gradient (HVG) and
FAINT. It is found that all the LVG SNe have approximately uniform velocities
at B maximum, while the FAINT SNe have values that decrease with increasing
Delta m_15(B), and the HVG SNe have a large spread. The EWs of the Fe-dominated
features are approximately constant in all SNe, while those of Intermediate
mass element (IME) lines have larger values for intermediate decliners and
smaller values for brighter and FAINT SNe. The HVG SNe have stronger Si II
6355-A lines, with no correlation with Delta m_15(B). It is also shown that the
Si II 5972 A EW and three EW ratios, including one analogous to the R(Si II)
ratio introduced by Nugent et al., are good spectroscopic indicators of
luminosity. The data suggest that all LVG SNe have approximately constant
kinetic energy, since burning to IME extends to similar velocities. The FAINT
SNe may have somewhat lower energies. The large velocities and EWs of the IME
lines of HVG SNe appear correlated with each other, but are not correlated with
the presence of high-velocity features in the Ca II infrared triplet in the
earliest spectra for the SNe for which such data exist.",2006-04-21T17:43:36Z
"Mid-Infrared Spectral Diagnostics of Nuclear and Extra-Nuclear Regions
  in Nearby Galaxies","Mid-infrared diagnostics are presented for a large portion of the Spitzer
Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS) sample plus archival data from the
Infrared Space Observatory and the Spitzer Space Telescope. Our main result is
that these mid-infrared diagnostics effectively constrain a target's dominant
power source. The combination of a high ionization line index and PAH strength
serves as an efficient discriminant between AGN and star-forming nuclei,
confirming progress made with ISO spectroscopy on starbursting and
ultraluminous infrared galaxies. The sensitivity of Spitzer allows us to probe
fainter nuclei and star-forming regions within galaxy disks. We find that both
star-forming nuclei and extranuclear regions stand apart from nuclei that are
powered by Seyfert or LINER activity. In fact, we identify areas within four
diagnostic diagrams containing >90% Seyfert/LINER nuclei or >90% HII
regions/HII nuclei. We also find that, compared to starbursting nuclei,
extranuclear regions typically separate even further from AGN, especially for
low-metallicity extranuclear environments. In addition, instead of the
traditional mid-infrared approach to differentiating between AGN and
star-forming sources that utilizes relatively weak high-ionization lines, we
show that strong low-ionization cooling lines of X-ray dominated regions like
[SiII] 34.82 micron can alternatively be used as excellent discrimants.
Finally, the typical target in this sample shows relatively modest interstellar
electron density (~400 cm^{-3}) and obscuration (A_V ~ 1.0 mag for a foreground
screen), consistent with a lack of dense clumps of highly obscured gas and dust
residing in the emitting regions. [Abridged]",2006-04-01T16:19:12Z
"A 2MASS All-Sky View of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy: Variation of the
  Metallicity Distribution Function Along the Sagittarius Stream","We present reliable measurements of the metallicity distribution function
(MDF) at different points along the tidal stream of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf
spheroidal (dSph) galaxy, based on high resolution, echelle spectroscopy of
candidate M giant members of the Sgr system. The Sgr MDF is found to evolve
significantly from a median [Fe/H] ~-0.4 in the core to ~-1.1 dex over a Sgr
leading arm length representing ~2.5-3.0 Gyr of dynamical (i.e. tidal
stripping) age. This is direct evidence that there can be significant chemical
differences between current dSph satellites and the bulk of the stars they have
contributed to the halo. Our results suggest that Sgr experienced a significant
change in binding energy over the past several Gyr, which has substantially
decreased its tidal boundary across a radial range over which there must have
been a significant metallicity gradient in the progenitor galaxy. By accounting
for MDF variation along the debris arms, we approximate the MDF Sgr would have
had several Gyr ago. We also analyze the MDF of a moving group of M giants we
previously discovered towards the North Galactic Cap having opposite radial
velocities to the infalling Sgr leading arm stars there and propose that most
of these represent Sgr trailing arm stars overlapping the Sgr leading arm in
this part of the sky. If so, these trailing arm stars further demonstrate the
strong MDF evolution within the Sgr stream.",2006-05-03T18:16:51Z
Extinction techniques and impact on dust property determination,"The near infrared extinction powerlaw index ($\beta$) and its uncertainty is
derived from three different techniques based on star counts, colour excess and
a combination of them. We have applied these methods to 2MASS data to determine
maps of $\beta$ and near infrared extinction of the small cloud IC 1396 W. The
combination of star counts and colour excess results in the most reliable
method to determine $\beta$. It is found that the use of the correct
$\beta$-map to transform colour excess values into extinction is fundamental
for column density profile analysis of clouds. We describe how artificial
photometric data, based on the model of stellar population synthesis of the
Galaxy (Robin et al. 2003), can be used to estimate uncertainties and derive
systematic effects of the extinction methods presented here. We find that all
colour excess based extinction determination methods are subject to small but
systematic offsets, which do not affect the star counting technique. These
offsets occur since stars seen through a cloud do not represent the same

  OH354.88-0.54 (V1018 Sco)","We present radio observations of the unique, recently formed, planetary
nebula (PN) associated with a very long-period OH/IR variable star V1018 Sco
that is unequivocally still in its asymptoticgiant branch phase. Two regions
within the optical nebula are clearly detected in nonthermal radio continuum
emission, with radio spectral indices comparable to those seen in
colliding-wind Wolf-Rayet binaries. We suggest that these represent shocked
interactions between the hot, fast stellar wind and the cold nebular shell that
represents the PN's slow wind moving away from the central star. This same
interface produces both synchrotron radio continuum and the optical PN
emission. The fast wind is neither spherical in geometry nor aligned withany
obvious optical or radio axis. We also report the detection of transient H2O
maser emission in this nebula.",2006-03-13T19:58:02Z
Dynamical PN Evolution with Magnetic Fields,"Hydrodynamical simulations played an important role in understanding the
dynamics and shaping of planetary nebulae in the past century. However,
hydrodynamical simulations were just a first order approach. The new millennium
arrived with the generalized understanding that the effects of magnetic fields
were necessary to study the dynamics of planetary nebulae. Thus, B-fields
introduced a whole new number of physical possibilities for the modeling. In
this paper, we review observational works done in the last 5 years and several
works on magnetohydrodynamics about proto-planetary nebulae, since all the
effort has been focused on that stage, and discuss different scenarios for the
origin of magnetized winds, and the relation binary-bipolararity.",2006-06-26T18:43:07Z
"C+O detonations in thermonuclear supernovae: Interaction with previously
  burned material","In the context of explosion models for Type Ia Supernovae, we present one-
and two-dimensional simulations of fully resolved detonation fronts in
degenerate C+O White Dwarf matter including clumps of previously burned
material. The ability of detonations to survive the passage through sheets of
nuclear ashes is tested as a function of the width and composition of the ash
region. We show that detonation fronts are quenched by microscopically thin
obstacles with little sensitivity to the exact ash composition. Front-tracking
models for detonations in macroscopic explosion simulations need to include
this effect in order to predict the amount of unburned material in delayed
detonation scenarios.",2006-05-11T15:40:23Z
"The production of short-lived radionuclides by new non-rotating and
  rotating Wolf-Rayet model stars","It has been speculated that WR winds may have contaminated the forming solar
system, in particular with short-lived radionuclides (half-lives in the
approximate 10^5 - 10^8 y range) that are responsible for a class of isotopic
anomalies found in some meteoritic materials. We revisit the capability of the
WR winds to eject these radionuclides using new models of single non-exploding
WR stars with metallicity Z = 0.02. The earlier predictions for non-rotating WR
stars are updated, and models for rotating such stars are used for the first
time in this context. We find that (1) rotation has no significant influence on
the short-lived radionuclide production by neutron capture during the core
He-burning phase, and (2) 26Al, 36Cl, 41Ca, and 107Pd can be wind-ejected by a
variety of WR stars at relative levels that are compatible with the meteoritic
analyses for a period of free decay of around 10^5 y between production and
incorporation into the forming solar system solid bodies. We confirm the
previously published conclusions that the winds of WR stars have a radionuclide
composition that can meet the necessary condition for them to be a possible
contaminating agent of the forming solar system. Still, it remains to be
demonstrated from detailed models that this is a sufficient condition for these
winds to have provided a level of pollution that is compatible with the
observations.",2006-03-21T15:28:40Z
"Non-Gaussianity in the Very Small Array CMB maps with
  Smooth-Goodness-of-fit tests","(Abridged) We have used the Rayner & Best (1989) smooth tests of
goodness-of-fit to study the Gaussianity of the Very Small Array (VSA) data.
Out of the 41 published VSA individual pointings dedicated to cosmological
observations, 37 are found to be consistent with Gaussianity, whereas four
pointings show deviations from Gaussianity. In two of them, these deviations
can be explained as residual systematic effects of a few visibility points
which, when corrected, have a negligible impact on the angular power spectrum.
The non-Gaussianity found in the other two (adjacent) pointings seems to be
associated to a local deviation of the power spectrum of these fields with
respect to the common power spectrum of the complete data set, at angular
scales of the third acoustic peak (l = 700-900). No evidence of residual
systematics is found in this case, and unsubstracted point sources are not a
plausible explanation either. If those visibilities are removed, a cosmological
analysis based on this new VSA power spectrum alone shows no differences in the
parameter constraints with respect to our published results, except for the
physical baryon density, which decreases by 10 percent. Finally, the method has
been also used to analyse the VSA observations in the Corona Borealis
supercluster region (Genova-Santos et al. 2005), which show a strong decrement
which cannot be explained as primordial CMB. Our method finds a clear deviation
(99.82%) with respect to Gaussianity in the second-order moment of the
distribution, and which can not be explained as systematic effects. A detailed
study shows that the non-Gaussianity is produced in scales of l~500, and that
this deviation is intrinsic to the data (in the sense that can not be explained
in terms of a Gaussian field with a different power spectrum).",2006-04-04T17:48:23Z
Shedding New Light on the 3C 273 Jet with the Spitzer Space Telescope,"We have performed infrared imaging of the jet of the quasar 3C 273 at
wavelengths 3.6 and 5.8 microns with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the
Spitzer Space Telescope. When combined with the radio, optical and X-ray
measurements, the IRAC photometry clearly shows that the optical emission is
dominated by the high-energy component of the jet, not by the radio synchrotron
component, as had been assumed to date. The high-energy component may be due to
a second synchrotron component or to IC scattering of ambient photons. In the
former case, we argue that the acceleration of protons exceeding 10^16 eV or
possibly even to 10^19 eV would be taking place in the jet. In contrast, the IC
model, into which highly relativistic Doppler beaming has to be incorporated,
requires very low-energy electrons (~ 1 MeV). The present polarization data in
the radio and optical would favor the former interpretation in the case of the
3C 273 jet. Sensitive and detailed measurements of optical polarization are
important to establish the radiation mechanism responsible for the high-energy
emission. The present study offers new clues as to the controversial origin of
the X-ray emission seen in many quasar jets.",2006-05-20T14:45:46Z
Magnetospheric Gap and Accumulation of Giant Planets Close to the Star,"The bunching of giant planets at a distance of several stellar radii may be
explained by the disruption of the inner part of the disk by the magnetosphere
of the star during the T Tauri stage of evolution. The rotating magnetic field
of the star gives rise to a low density magnetospheric gap where stellar
migration is strongly suppressed. We performed full 3D magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of the disk-magnetosphere interaction and examined conditions for
which the magnetospheric gap is ""empty"", by changing the misalignment angle
between magnetic and rotational axes of the star, Theta, and by lowering the
adiabatic index gamma, which mocks up the effect of heat conductivity and
cooling. Our simulations show that for a wide range of plausible conditions the
gap is essentially empty. However, in the case of large misalignment angles
Theta, part of the funnel stream is located in the equatorial plane and the gap
is not empty. Furthermore, if the adiabatic index is small (gamma=1.1) and the
rotational and magnetic axes are almost aligned, then matter penetrates through
the magnetosphere due to 3D instabilities forming high-density equatorial
funnels. For these two limits there is appreciable matter density in the
equatorial plane of the disk so that a planet may migrate into the star.",2006-06-08T00:27:20Z
"On the validity of the 630 nm Fe I nm lines for the magnetometry of the
  internetwork quiet Sun","The purpose of this work is to analyze the reliability of the magnetic field
strengths inferred from the 630 nm pair of Fe I lines at internetwork quiet Sun
regions. Some numerical experiments have been performed that demonstrate the
inability of these lines to recover the magnetic field strength in such low
flux solar regions. It is shown how different model atmospheres, with magnetic
field strengths ranging from few hundred Gauss to kiloGauss, give rise to
Stokes profiles that can not be distinguished. The reasons for this degeneracy
are discussed.",2006-05-18T08:05:24Z
The Ultraluminous X-ray Source in Holmberg IX and its Environment,"We present optical observations of an ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) in
Holmberg IX, a dwarf galaxy near M81. The ULX has an average X-ray luminosity
of some 10^{40} erg/s. It is located in a huge (400pc x 300pc) ionized nebula
being much larger than normal supernova remnants. From the observed emission
lines (widths and ratios) we find that the structure is due to collisional
excitation by shocks, rather than by photoionization.
  We identify the optical counterpart to be a 22.8 mag blue star (M_V=-5.0)
belonging to a small stellar cluster. From isochrone fitting of our
multi-colour photometry we determine a cluster age of 20 to 50 Myr. We also
discovered strong stellar HeII4686 emission (equivalent width of 10 A) which
proves the identification with the X-ray source, and which suggests the
presence of an X-ray heated accretion disc around the putative black hole.",2006-03-28T16:44:17Z
Deep and wide field imaging of the Coma cluster: the data,"We have obtained deep and wide field imaging of the Coma cluster of galaxies
with the CFH12K camera at CFHT in the B, V, R and I filters. In this paper, we
present the observations, data reduction, catalogs and first scientific
results.
  We investigated the quality of our data by internal and external literature
comparisons. We also checked the realisation of the observational requirements
we set.
  Our observations cover two partially overlapping areas of $42 \times 28$
arcmin$^2$, leading to a total area of 0.72 $\times$ 0.82 deg$^2$. We have
produced catalogs of objects that cover a range of more than 10 magnitudes and
are complete at the 90% level at B$\sim$25, V$\sim$24, R$\sim$24 and
I$\sim$23.5 for stellar-like objects, and at B$\sim$22, V$\sim$21, R$\sim$20.75
and I$\sim$20.5 for faint low-surface-brightness galaxy-like objects.
Magnitudes are in good agreement with published values from R$\sim$16 to
R$\sim$25. The photometric uncertainties are of the order of 0.1 magnitude at
R$\sim$20 and of 0.3 magnitude at R$\sim$25. Astrometry is accurate to
0.5~arcsec and also in good agreement with published data.
  Our catalog provides a rich dataset that can be mined for years to come to
gain new insights into the formation and evolution of the Coma cluster and its
galaxy population. As an illustration of the data quality, we examine the
bright part of the Colour Magnitude Relation (B-R versus R) derived from the
catalog and find that it is in excellent agreement with that derived for
galaxies with redshifts in the Coma cluster, and with previous CMRs estimated
in the literature.",2006-06-19T08:49:03Z
"Formation of Galactic Systems in Light of the Magnesium Abundance in
  Field Stars.III.the Halo","We analyze the relations between the relative magnesium abundances,
metallicities, and Galactic orbital elements for halo stars. We show that the
relative magnesium abundances in protodisk halo stars are virtually independent
of metallicity and lie within a fairly narrow range while presumably accreted
stars demonstrate a large spread in relative magnesium abundances up to
negative [Mg/Fe]. The mean metallicity of magnesium-poor ([Mg/Fe]<0.2 dex)
accreted stars has been found to be displaced toward the negative values when
passing from stars with low azimuthal velocities to those with high ones at
\Delta[Fe/H]=0.5dex. The mean apogalactic radii and inclinations of the orbits
also increase while their eccentricities decrease. As a result negative radial
and vertical gradients in relative magnesium abundances are observed in the
accreted halo in the absence of correlations between the [Mg/Fe] ratios and
other orbital elements, while these correlations are found at a high
significance level for genetically related Galactic stars. We surmise that as
the masses of dwarf galaxies decrease, the maximum SNII masses and hence, the
yield of \alpha-elements in them also decrease. In this case, the relation
between the [Mg/Fe] ratios and the inclinations and sizes of the orbits of
accreted stars is in complete agreement with numerical simulations of dynamical
processes during the interaction of galaxies. Thus the behavior of the
magnesium abundance in accreted stars suggests that the satellite galaxies are
disrupted and lose their stars en masse only after dynamical friction reduces
significantly the sizes of their orbits and drags them into the Galactic plane.
Less massive satellite galaxies are disrupted even before their orbits change
appreciably under tidal forces.",2006-06-23T14:02:31Z
"High-Resolution Infrared Imaging of Herschel 36 SE: A Showcase for the
  Influence of Massive Stars in Cluster Environments","We present high-resolution infrared imaging of the massive star-forming
region around the O-star Herschel 36. Special emphasis is given to a compact
infrared source at 0"".25 southeast of the star. The infrared source, hereafter
Her 36 SE, is extended in the broad-band images, but features spatially
unresolved Br gamma line emission. The line-emission source coincides in
position with the previous HST detections in H alpha and the 2 cm radio
continuum emission detected by VLA interferometry. We propose that the infrared
source Her 36 SE harbors an early B-type star, deeply embedded in a dusty
cloud. The fan shape of the cloud with Herschel 36 at its apex, though,
manifests direct and ongoing destructive influence of the O7V star on Her 36
SE.",2006-05-10T20:04:05Z
The Central Regions of M31 in the 3 - 5 micron Wavelength Region,"Images obtained with NIRI on the Gemini North telescope are used to
investigate the photometric properties of the central regions of M31 in the 3 -
5 micron wavelength range. The light distribution in the central arcsecond
differs from what is seen in the near-infrared in the sense that the difference
in peak brigh tness between P1 and P2 is larger in M' than in K'; no obvious
signature of P3 is dete cted in M'. These results can be explained if there is
a source of emission that contributes ~ 20% of the peak M' light of P1 and has
an effective temperature of no more than a few hundred K that is located
between P1 and P2. Based on the red K-M' color of this source, it is suggested
that the emission originates in a circumstellar dust shell surrounding a single
bright AGB star. A similar bright source that is ~ 8 arcsec from the center of
the galaxy is also detected in M'. Finally, the (L', K-L') color-magnitude
diagram of unblended stars shows a domin ant AGB population with photometric
characteristics that are similar to those of the most luminous M giants in the
Galactic bulge.",2006-04-28T21:43:18Z
Will black holes eventually engulf the universe?,"The Babichev-Dokuchaev-Eroshenko model for the accretion of dark energy onto
black holes has been extended to deal with black holes with non-static metrics.
The possibility that for an asymptotic observer a black hole with large mass
will rapidly increase and eventually engulf the Universe at a finite time in
the future has been studied by using reasonable values for astronomical
parameters. It is concluded that such a phenomenon is forbidden for all black
holes in quintessential cosmological models.",2006-03-28T11:41:12Z
"A 3-Dimensional study of the Local Environment of Bright IRAS Galaxies:
  The AGN/Starburst connection","We present a 3-dimensional study of the local ($\leq 100 h^{-1}$ kpc) and the
large scale ($\leq$ 1 $h^{-1}$ Mpc) environment of Bright IRAS Galaxies
(BIRGs). For this purpose we use 87 BIRGs located at high galactic latitudes
(with 0.008$\leq z \leq$0.018) as well as a control sample of non-active
galaxies having the same morphological, redshift and diameter size
distributions as the corresponding BIRG sample. Using the Center for
Astrophysics (CfA2) and Southern Sky Redshift Survey (SSRS) galaxy catalogues
($m_b\lesssim 15.5$)as well as our own spectroscopic observations
($m_b\lesssim19.0$) for a subsample of the original BIRG sample, we find that
the fraction of BIRGs with a close neighbor is significantly higher than that
of their control sample. Comparing with a related analysis of Sy1 and Sy2
galaxies of Koulouridis et al. (2006) we find that BIRGs have a similar
environment as Sy2s, although the fraction of BIRGs with a bright close
neighbor is even higher than that of Sy2 galaxies. An additional analysis of
the relation between FIR colors and the type of activity of each BIRG shows a
significant difference between the colors of strongly-interacting and
non-interacting starbursts and a resemblance between the colors of
non-interacting starbursts and Sy2s. Our results support the view where close
interactions can drive molecular clouds towards the galactic center, triggering
starburst activity and obscuring the nuclear activity. When the close neighbor
moves away, starburst activity is reduced with the simultaneous appearance of
an obscured (type 2) AGN. Finally, the complete disentanglement of the pair
gives birth to an unobscured (type 1) AGN.",2006-06-14T22:02:34Z
"A Strong X-Ray Flux Ratio Anomaly in the Quadruply Lensed Quasar PG
  1115+080","PG 1115+080 is a quadruply lensed quasar at z=1.72 whose image positions are
well fit by simple models of the lens galaxy (at z=0.31). At optical
wavelengths, the bright close pair of images exhibits a modest flux ratio
anomaly (factors of ~1.2-1.4 over the past 22 years) with respect to these same
models. We show here that as observed in X-rays with Chandra, the flux ratio
anomaly is far more extreme, roughly a factor of 6. The contrasting flux ratio
anomalies in the optical and X-ray band confirm the microlensing hypothesis and
set a lower limit on the size of the optical continuum emission region that is
\~10-100 times larger than expected from a thin accretion disk model.",2006-04-06T21:31:28Z
"Distinguishing Propagation vs. Launch Physics of Astrophysical Jets and
  the Role of Experiments","The absence of other viable momentum sources for collimated flows leads to
the likelihood that magnetic fields play a fundamental role in jet launch
and/or collimation in astrophysical jets. To best understand the physics of
jets, it is useful to distinguish between the launch region where the jet is
accelerated and the larger scales where the jet propagates as a collimated
structure. Observations presently resolve jet propagation, but not the launch
region. Simulations typically probe the launch and propagation regions
separately, but not both together. Here, I identify some of the physics of jet
launch vs. propagation and what laboratory jet experiments to date have probed.
Reproducing an astrophysical jet in the lab is unrealistic, so maximizing the
benefit of the experiments requires clarifying the astrophysical connection.",2006-06-28T06:41:43Z
Toward Resolving the Outflow Engine: An Observational Perspective,"Jets from young stars represent one of the most striking signposts of star
formation. The phenomenon has been researched for over two decades and there is
now general agreement that such jets are generated as a by-product of
accretion; most likely by the accretion disk itself. Thus they mimic what
occurs in more exotic objects such as active galactic nuclei and micro-quasars.
The precise mechanism for their production however remains a mystery. To a
large degree, progress is hampered observationally by the embedded nature of
many jet sources as well as a lack of spatial resolution: Crude estimates, as
well as more sophisticated models, nevertheless suggest that jets are
accelerated and focused on scales of a few AU at most.
  It is only in the past few years however that we have begun to probe such
scales in detail using classical T Tauri stars as touchstones. Application of
adaptive optics, data provided by the HST, use of specialised techniques such
as spectro-astrometry, and the development of spectral diagnostic tools, are
beginning to reveal conditions in the jet launch zone. This has helped
enormously to constrain models. Further improvements in the quality of the
observational data are expected when the new generation of interferometers come
on-line. Here we review some of the most dramatic findings in this area since
Protostars and Planets~IV including indications for jet rotation, i.e. that
they transport angular momentum. We will also show how measurements, such as
those of width and the velocity field close to the source, suggest jets are
initially launched as warm magneto-centrifugal disk winds. (abridged)",2006-05-23T19:01:59Z

"Optical polarimetry and infrared photometry of two AM Her binaries: 1RXS
  J161008.0+035222 and 1RXS J231603.9-052713","We present the first optical circular and linear polarization measurements of
two polar candidates from ROSAT: 1RXS J161008.0+035222 and 1RXS
J231603.9-052713. We also present H band near-infrared photometry of the last
object. The presence of strong circular polarization confirms them as AM Her
systems. 1RXS J231603.9-052713 was observed in two different brightness states.
The orbital phase dependence of the flux and polarization of 1RXS
J161008.0+035222 is reasonably fitted with a simple model in which the binary
is observed at a small inclination and the magnetic field axis is almost
parallel to the white-dwarf rotation axis resulting in the accretion column
axis being seen from top during the whole orbital revolution. The magnetic
field is probably in the 10 to 20 MG range. The circular polarization of 1RXS
J231603.9-052713 is complex and highly variable. The light-curves of that
object have been fitted using a model which includes the white-dwarf, a heated
secondary and a point-like accretion region. The secondary emission contributes
significantly even in optical wavelengths. This model also reproduces the main
features of the optical polarization of 1RXS J231603.9-052713. We estimate the
main parameters of the binary, of the accretion region and the distance to the
system. However, a more precise interpretation of this system should take in
account an extended and inhomogeneous accreting region as well as non-radial
accretion.",2006-04-13T16:23:49Z
"New symmetries in microphysics, new stable forms of matter around us","Extension of particle symmetry implies new conserved charges and the lightest
particles, possessing such charges, should be stable. Created in early
Universe, stable charged heavy leptons and quarks can exist and, hidden in
elusive atoms bound by Coulomb attraction, can play the role of dark matter.
The problem of this scenario is that in the expanding Universe it is not
possible to recombine all the charged particles into elusive ""atoms"", and
positively charged particles, which escape such recombination, bind with
electrons in atoms of anomalous isotopes with pregalactic abundance, generally
exceeding terrestrial upper limits. Realistic scenarios of composite dark
matter, avoiding this problem of anomalous isotope over-production, inevitably
predict the existence of primordial ""atoms"", in which primordial helium traps
all the free negatively charged heavy constituents with charge -2. Study of the
possibility for such primordial heavy alpha-particle with compensated charge to
exist as well as the search for the stable charged constituents in cosmic rays
and accelerators provide crucial test for the new forms of stable matter.",2006-07-04T11:28:41Z
"A search for kilogauss magnetic fields in white dwarfs and hot subdwarf
  stars","We present new results of a survey for weak magnetic fields among DA white
dwarfs with inclusion of some brighter hot subdwarf stars. We have detected
variable circular polarization in the Halpha line of the hot subdwarf star
Feige 34 (SP: sdO). From these data, we estimate that the longitudinal magnetic
field of this star varies from -1.1 +/- 3.2 kG to +9.6 +/- 2.6 kG, with a mean
of about +5 kG and a period longer than 2 h. In this study, we also confirm the
magnetic nature of white dwarf WD1105-048 and present upper limits of kilogauss
longitudinal magnetic fields of 5 brightest DA white dwarfs. Our data support
recent finding that 25% of white dwarfs have kilogauss magnetic fields. This
frequency also confirms results of early estimates obtained using the magnetic
field function of white dwarfs.",2006-05-16T21:33:37Z
Are Short GRBs Really Hard?,"Thanks to the rapid position notice and response by HETE-2 and Swift, the
X-ray afterglow emissions have been found for four recent short gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs; GRB 050509b, GRB 050709, GRB 050724, and GRB 050813). The
positions of three out of four short GRBs are coincident with galaxies with no
current or recent star formation. This discovery tightens the case for a
different origin for short and long GRBs. On the other hand, from the prompt
emission point of view, a short GRB shows a harder spectrum comparing to that
of the long duration GRBs according to the BATSE observations. We investigate
the prompt emission properties of four short GRBs observed by Swift/BAT. We
found that the hardness of all four BAT short GRBs is in between the BATSE
range for short and long GRBs. We will discuss the spectral properties of short
GRBs including the short GRB sample of Konus-Wind and HETE-2 to understand the
hard nature of the BATSE short GRBs.",2006-05-30T13:44:01Z
Disklike Structure in the Semiregular Pulsating Star X Her,"The author presents the results of Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland (BIMA) array
interferometric observations in the CO J=1-0 line toward X Her and EP Aqr, the
semiregular pulsating stars with a composite CO line profile, and also reports
finding of a disklike structure in X Her. In the CO spectrum both of X Her and
EP Aqr, a composite profile including narrow and broad components is seen as
reported by the previous single-dish observations. The spatial structure of the
broad component region of X Her shows a bipolar shape, and that of the narrow
component shows an elliptical/spherical shape. The blue- and red-shifted parts
of the X Her narrow component show a systematic difference in the velocity
integrated intensity map. The spatio-kinetic properties of the X Her narrow
component are reminiscent of a Keplerian rotating disk with a central mass of
0.9 Msun. The spatial distributions of both the narrow and the broad components
of EP Aqr appear to be roughly round with the same peak positions; no
significant velocity gradient is seen. The spatio-kinetic properties of EP Aqr
are reminiscent of a multiple-shell structure model rather than of a bipolar
flow and disk model.",2006-05-04T03:20:09Z
"The Three Dimensional Structural Shape of the Gravitational Potential in
  the Local Group","The Local Group is a small galaxy cluster with the membership of 62 nearby
galaxies including the Milky Way and M31. Although the Local Group has yet to
be virialized, it interacts with the surrounding matter as one gravitationally
bound system. To understand the formation and evolution of the Local Group as
well as its member galaxies, it is important to reconstruct the gravitational
potential field from the surrounding matter distribution in the local cosmic
web. By measuring the anisotropy in the spatial distribution of the Local Group
galaxies, which is assumed to be induced by the local gravitational tidal field
, we resolve the three dimensional structure of the gravitational potential in
the vicinity of the Milky Way smoothed on the Local Group mass scale. Our
results show that (i) the minor principal axis of the Local Group tidal field
is in the equatorial direction of alpha_{p}=15^{h}00^{m} and delta_{p}=20^{d};
(ii) it has a prolate shape with axial ratio of 0.5 +/- 0.13; (iii) the global
tides in the Local Group is quite strong, which may provide a partial
explanation for the low abundance of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group.",2006-05-10T06:14:40Z
Millimetric Properties of Gamma Ray Burst Host Galaxies,"We present millimetre (mm) and submillimetre (submm) photometry of a sample
of host galaxies of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), obtained using the MAMBO2 and
SCUBA bolometer arrays respectively. These observations were obtained as part
of an ongoing project to investigate the status of GRBs as indicators of star
formation. Our targets include two of the most unusual GRB host galaxies,
selected as likely candidate submm galaxies: the extremely red (R-K approx 5)
host of GRB 030115, and the extremely faint (R>29.5) host of GRB 020124.
Neither of these galaxies is detected, but the deep upper limits for GRB 030115
impose constraints on its spectral energy distribution.
  As a framework for interpreting these data, and for predicting the results of
forthcoming submm surveys of Swift-derived host samples, we model the expected
flux and redshift distributions based on luminosity functions of both submm
galaxies and GRBs, assuming a direct proportionality between the GRB rate
density and the global star formation rate density. We derive the effects of
possible sources of uncertainty in these assumptions, including an
anticorrelation between GRB rate and the global average metallicity.",2006-04-21T10:49:48Z
Analysis methods for Atmospheric Cerenkov Telescopes,"Three different analysis techniques for Atmospheric Imaging System are

Width of the 511 KeV Line from the Bulge of the Galaxy,"In this paper I present the detail estimations for the width of the 511 keV
line produced by a mechanism when dark matter is represented by macroscopically
large dense nuggets. I argue that the width of 511 keV emission in this
mechanism is very narrow (in a few keV range) in agreement with all
observations. The dominant mechanism of the annihilation in this case is the
positronium formation e^+e^-to ^1S_0 to 2\gamma rather than a direct e^+e^- to
2\gamma$ annihilation. I also discuss some generic features of the \gamma rays

  photometry and astrometry","We present low-resolution turbulence profiles of the atmosphere above Dome C,
Antarctica, measured with the MASS instrument during 25 nights in March-May
2004. Except for the lowest layer, Dome C has significantly less turbulence
than Cerro Tololo and Cerro Pachon. In particular, the integrated turbulence at
16 km is always less than the median values at the two Chilean sites. From
these profiles we evaluate the photometric noise produced by scintillation, and
the atmospheric contribution to the error budget in narrow-angle differential
astrometry. In comparison with the two mid-latitude sites in Chile, Dome C
offers a potential gain of about 3.6 in both photometric precision (for long
integrations) and narrow-angle astrometry precision. These gain estimates are
preliminary, being computed with average wind-speed profiles, but the validity
of our approach is confirmed by independent data. Although the data from Dome C
cover a fairly limited time frame, they lend strong support to expectations
that Dome C will offer significant advantages for photometric and astrometric
studies.",2006-04-26T08:01:20Z
The HII Region of a Primordial Star,"The concordance model of cosmology and structure formation predicts the
formation of isolated very massive stars at high redshifts in dark matter
dominated halos of 10^5 to 10^6 Msun. These stars photo-ionize their host
primordial molecular clouds, expelling all the baryons from their halos. When
the stars die, a relic HII region is formed within which large amounts of
molecular hydrogen form which will allow the gas to cool efficiently when
gravity assembles it into larger dark matter halos. The filaments surrounding
the first star hosting halo are largely shielded and provide the pathway for
gas to stream into the halo when the star has died. We present the first fully
three dimensional cosmological radiation hydrodynamical simulations that follow
all these effects. A novel adaptive ray casting technique incorporates the time
dependent radiative transfer around point sources. This approach is fast enough
so that radiation transport, kinetic rate equations, and hydrodynamics are
solved self-consistently. It retains the time derivative of the transfer
equation and is explicitly photon conserving. This method is integrated with
the cosmological adaptive mesh refinement code enzo, and runs on distributed
and shared memory parallel architectures. Where applicable the three
dimensional calculation not only confirm expectations from earlier one
dimensional results but also illustrate the multi-fold hydrodynamic
complexities of HII regions. In the absence of stellar winds the circumstellar
environments of the first supernovae and putative early gamma-ray bursts will
be of low density ~1 cm^-3. Albeit marginally resolved, ionization front
instabilities lead to cometary and elephant trunk like small scale structures
reminiscent of nearby star forming regions.",2006-06-01T05:47:59Z
Spatially Resolved X-ray Spectroscopy of Vela Shrapnel A,"We present the detailed X-ray spectroscopy of Vela shrapnel A with the
XMM-Newton satellite. Vela shrapnel A is one of several protrusions identified
as bullets from Vela supernova explosion. The XMM-Newton image shows that
shrapnel A consists of a bright knot and a faint trailing wake. We extracted
spectra from various regions, finding a prominent Si Ly$_\alpha$ emission line
in all the spectra. All the spectra are well represented by the non-equilibrium
ionization (NEI) model. The abundances are estimated to be O$\sim$0.3,
Ne$\sim$0.9, Mg$\sim$0.8, Si$\sim$3, Fe$\sim$0.8 times their solar values. The
non-solar abundance ratio between O and Si indicates that shrapnel A originates
from a deep layer of a progenitor star. We found that the relative abundances
between heavy elements are almost uniform in shrapnel A, which suggests that
the ejecta from supernova explosion are well mixed with swept-up interstellar
medium.",2006-03-17T03:33:53Z
Power spectrum of HI intensity fluctuations in DDO 210,"We measure the power spectrum of HI intensity fluctuations in the extremely
faint (M_B ~ -10.9) dwarf galaxy DDO 210 using a visibility based estimator
that is well suited in very low signal to noise ratio regimes. DDO 210's HI
power spectrum is well fit by a power law $P_HI(U)= A U^{\alpha}$ with
$\alpha=-2.75 \pm0.45$ over the length-scales 80 pc to 500 pc. We also find
that the power spectrum does not change with an increase in the velocity
channel width, indicating that the measured fluctuations correspond mainly to
density fluctuations. However, Kolmogorov turbulence (with a velocity structure
function spectral slope of 2/3) cannot be ruled out from the present
observations. The value of the slope $\alpha$ is similar to that obtained in
the Milkyway. In contrast to the Milkyway, DDO 210 has three orders of
magnitude less HI, no spiral arms, and also no measurable ongoing star
formation. The fact that the power spectrum slope is nonetheless similar in
these two galaxies (and also similar to the values measured for the LMC and
SMC) suggests that there is some universal, star formation independent,
phenomenon responsible for producing fine scale structure in the gas.",2006-07-17T09:58:50Z
Composite Dark Matter and its Charged Constituents,"Stable charged heavy leptons and quarks can exist and hide in elusive atoms,
bound by Coulomb attraction and playing the role of dark matter. However, in
the expanding Universe it is not possible to recombine all the charged
particles into such atoms, and the positively charged particles, which escape
this recombination, bind with electrons in atoms of anomalous isotopes with
pregalactic abundance, exceeding substantially the terrestrial upper limits.
This abundance can not be reduced in the dense matter bodies, if negatively
charged particles have charge -1. Therefore composite dark matter can involve
only negatively charged particles with charge -2, while stable heavy particles
with charge -1 should be excluded. Realistic scenarios of composite dark
matter, avoiding this problem of anomalous isotope over-production, inevitably
predict the existence of primordial ""atoms"", in which primordial helium traps
all the free negatively charged heavy constituents with charge -2. Study of the
possibility for such primordial heavy $\alpha$ particle with compensated charge
to exist as well as the search for the stable charged constituents in cosmic
rays and accelerators provide crucial test for composite dark matter scenarios.",2006-04-25T10:27:16Z
Why X-ray--Selected AGN Appear Optically Dull,"We investigate why half of X-ray--selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) in
deep surveys lack signs of accretion in their optical spectra. The majority of
these ``optically--dull'' AGN are no more than 6 times fainter than their host
galaxies in rest-frame R-band; as such, AGN lines are unlikely to be
overwhelmed by stellar continuum in at least half the sample. We find that
optically--dull AGN have the mid--infrared emission and L(x)/L(IR) ratios
characteristic of local Seyferts, suggesting that the cause of optical dullness
is not missing UV--optical continua. We compare the morphologies of 22
optically--dull and 9 optically--active AGN at 0.5<z<0.8, and find that
optically--dull AGN show a wide range of axis ratio, but optically--active AGN
have only very round axis ratios. We conclude that hard X-rays select AGN in
host galaxies with a wide range of inclination angle, but only those AGN in the
most face-on or spheroidal host galaxies show optical emission lines. Thus,
extranuclear dust in the host galaxy plays an important role in hiding the
emission lines of optically--dull AGN.",2006-03-13T17:50:23Z
"X-Ray Absorption and an X-Ray Jet in the Radio-Loud Broad Absorption
  Line Quasar PG 1004+130","We investigate the X-ray properties of PG 1004+130, a low-redshift radio-loud
broad absorption line (BAL) quasar with a hybrid FR I/FR II radio morphology.
The 22.2 ks XMM-Newton and 41.6 ks Chandra observations presented here are the
first X-ray detections of PG 1004+130 and constitute the highest spectral
quality X-ray observations of a radio-loud BAL quasar available to date. The
Chandra ACIS-S spectrum shows evidence for complex soft X-ray absorption not
detected in the data obtained 1.7 yr previously with XMM-Newton, with a
best-fit intrinsic column density of N_H=1.2e22 cm-2 for the preferred
partial-covering model. There is no significant difference in the hard-band
power-law photon index of ~1.5 between the two observations. The Chandra image
also reveals extended X-ray emission ~8'' (30 kpc) south-east of the nucleus,
aligned with the FR I jet but upstream of the 1.4 GHz radio-brightness peak.
The jet is not detected by HST, and the optical upper limit rules out a simple
single-component synchrotron interpretation of the radio-to-X-ray emission. The
multiwavelength characteristics of the PG 1004+130 jet, including its
relatively flat X-ray power law and concave spectral energy distribution, are
similar to those of powerful FR II jets. The lack of strong beaming in PG
1004+130 limits the efficiency of inverse Compton upscattering, and we consider
the X-ray emission to most likely arise from a second synchrotron component
generated by highly energetic electrons.",2006-07-03T20:47:38Z
"Existence of black holes in Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe
  dominated by dark energy","We study the existence of black holes in a homogeneous and isotropic
expanding Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe dominated by dark energy.
We show that black holes can exist in such a universe by considering some
specific McVittie solutions. Although these solutions violate all three energy
conditions, the FRW background does satisfy the weak energy condition.",2006-07-25T06:12:10Z
Continuous optical monitoring during the prompt emission of GRB 060111B,"We present the time-resolved optical emission of GRB 060111B during its
prompt phase, measured with the TAROT robotic observatory. This is the first
time that the optical emission from a gamma-ray burst has been continuously
monitored with a temporal resolution of a few seconds during the prompt
gamma-ray phase. The temporal evolution of the prompt optical emission at the
level of several seconds is used to provide a clue to the origin of this
emission. The optical emission was found to decay steadily from our first
measure, 28s after the trigger, in contrast to the gamma-ray emission, which
exhibits strong variability at the same time. This behaviour strongly suggests
that the optical emission is due to the reverse shock.",2006-04-04T13:41:08Z
"A Very High Spectral Resolution Study of Ground-State OH Masers in
  W3(OH)","We present VLBA observations of the ground-state hydroxyl masers in W3(OH) at
0.02 km s-1 spectral resolution. Over 250 masers are detected, including 56
Zeeman pairs. Lineshapes are predominantly Gaussian or combinations of several
Gaussians, with normalized deviations typically of the same magnitude as in
masers in other species. Typical FWHM maser linewidths are 0.15 to 0.38 km s-1
and are larger in the 1665 MHz transition than in the other three ground-state
transitions. The satellite-line 1612 and 1720 MHz masers show no evidence of
sigma^+/-2,3 components. The spatial positions of most masers are seen to vary
across the line profile, with many spots showing clear, organized positional
gradients. Equivalent line-of-sight velocity gradients in the plane of the sky
typically range from 0.01 to 1 km s-1 AU-1 (i.e., positional gradients of 1 to
100 AU (km s-1)-1). Small velocity gradients in the 1667 MHz transition support
theoretical predictions that 1667 MHz masers appear in regions with small
velocity shifts along the amplification length. Deconvolved maser spot sizes
appear to be larger in the line wings but do not support a spherical maser
geometry.",2006-04-25T21:19:09Z
"Helium enhancements in globular cluster stars from Asymptotic Giant
  Branch star pollution","Using a chemical evolution model we investigate the intriguing suggestion
that there are populations of stars in some globular clusters (e.g. NGC 2808,
omega Centauri) with enhanced levels of helium (Y from about 0.28 to 0.40)
compared to the majority of the population that presumably have a primordial
helium abundance. We assume that a previous generation of massive
low-metallicity Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars has polluted the cluster
gas via a slow stellar wind. We use two independent sets of AGB yields computed
from detailed models to follow the evolution of helium, carbon, nitrogen and
oxygen in the cluster gas using a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) and a
number of top-heavy IMFs. In no case were we able to fit the observational
constraints, Y > 0.30 and C+N+O approximately constant. Depending on the shape
of the IMF and the yields, we either obtained Y approximately greater than 0.30
and large increases in C+N+O or Y < 0.30 and C+N+O approximately constant.
These results suggest that either AGB stars alone are not responsible for the
large helium enrichment or that any dredge-up from this generation of stars was
less than predicted by standard models.",2006-05-21T21:56:23Z
"The Spitzer c2d Survey of Nearby Dense Cores: III: Low Mass Star
  Formation in a Small Group, L1251B","We present a comprehensive study of a low-mass star-forming region,L1251B, at
wavelengths from the near-infrared to the millimeter. L1251B, where only one
protostar, IRAS 22376+7455, was known previously, is confirmed to be a small
group of protostars based on observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The
most luminous source of L1251B is located 5"" north of the IRAS position. A
near-infrared bipolar nebula, which is not associated with the brightest object
and is located at the southeast corner of L1251B, has been detected in the IRAC
bands. OVRO and SMA interferometric observations indicate that the brightest
source and the bipolar nebula source in the IRAC bands are deeply embedded disk
sources.Submillimeter continuum observations with single-dish telescopes and
the SMA interferometric observations suggest two possible prestellar objects
with very high column densities. Outside of the small group, many young stellar
object candidates have been detected over a larger region of 12' x 12'.
Extended emission to the east of L1251B has been detected at 850 micron; this
""east core"" may be a site for future star formation since no point source has
been detected with IRAC or MIPS. This region is therefore a possible example of
low-mass cluster formation, where a small group of pre- and protostellar
objects (L1251B) is currently forming, alongside a large starless core (the
east core).",2006-05-18T21:46:25Z
Self-Gravity Driven Instabilities in the ISM,"In order to understand star formation it is important to understand the
dynamics of atomic and molecular clouds in the interstellar medium (ISM).
Nonlinear hydrodynamic flows are a key component to the ISM. One route by which
nonlinear flows arise is the onset and evolution of interfacial instabilities.
Interfacial instabilities act to modify the interface between gas components at
different densities and temperatures. Such an interface may be subject to a
host of instabilities, including the Rayleigh-Taylor, Kelvin-Helmholtz, and
Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities. Recently, a new density interface instability
was identified. This self-gravity interfacial instability (SGI) causes any
displacement of the interface to gr ow on roughly a free-fall time scale, even
when the perturbation wavelength is much less than the Jeans length. In
previous work, we used numerical simulations to confirm the expectations of
linear theory and examine the nonlinear evolution of the SGI. We now continue
our study by generalizing our initial conditions to allow the acceleration due
to self-gravity to be non-zero across the interface. We also consider the
behaviour of the SGI for perturbation wavelengths near the Jeans wavelength. We
conclude that the action of self-gravity across a density interface may play a
significant role in the ISM either by fueling the growth of new instabilities
or modifying the evolution of existing instabilities.",2006-03-29T23:26:22Z
"Spitzer/MIPS Limits on Asteroidal Dust in the Pulsar Planetary System
  PSR B1257+1","With the MIPS camera on Spitzer, we have searched for far-infrared emission
from dust in the planetary system orbiting pulsar PSR 1257+12. With accuracies
of 0.05 mJy at 24 um and 1.5 mJy at 70 um, photometric measurements find no
evidence for emission at these wavelengths. These observations place new upper
limits on the luminosity of dust with temperatures between 20 and 1000 K. They
are particularly sensitive to dust temperatures of 100-200 K, for which they
limit the dust luminosity to below $3 \times 10^{-5}$ of the pulsar's spin-down
luminosity, three orders of magnitude better than previous limits. Despite
these improved constraints on dust emission, an asteroid belt similar to the
Solar System's cannot be ruled out.",2006-04-05T22:08:54Z
Note on Redshift Distortion in Fourier Space,"We explore features of redshift distortion in Fourier analysis of N-body
simulations. The phases of the Fourier modes of the dark matter density
fluctuation are generally shifted by the peculiar motion along the line of
sight, the induced phase shift is stochastic and has probability distribution
function (PDF) symmetric to the peak at zero shift while the exact shape
depends on the wave vector, except on very large scales where phases are
invariant by linear perturbation theory. Analysis of the phase shifts motivates
our phenomenological models for the bispectrum in redshift space. Comparison
with simulations shows that our toy models are very successful in modeling
bispectrum of equilateral and isosceles triangles at large scales. In the
second part we compare the monopole of the power spectrum and bispectrum in the
radial and plane-parallel distortion to test the plane-parallel approximation.
We confirm the results of Scoccimarro (2000) that difference of power spectrum
is at the level of 10%, in the reduced bispectrum such difference is as small
as a few percents. However, on the plane perpendicular to the line of sight of
k_z=0, the difference in power spectrum between the radial and plane-parallel
approximation can be more than 10%, and even worse on very small scales. Such
difference is prominent for bispectrum, especially for those configurations of
tilted triangles. The non-Gaussian signals under radial distortion on small
scales are systematically biased downside than that in plane-parallel
approximation, while amplitudes of differences depend on the opening angle of
the sample to the observer. The observation gives warning to the practice of
using the power spectrum and bispectrum measured on the k_z=0 plane as
estimation of the real space statistics.",2006-04-11T07:07:14Z
Rapid Star Formation in the Presence of Active Galactic Nuclei,"Recent observations reveal galaxies in the early Universe (2<z<6.4) with
large reservoirs of molecular gas and extreme star formation rates. For a very
large range of sources, a tight relationship exists between star formation rate
and the luminosity of the HCN J=1-0 spectral line, but sources at redshifts of
z~2 and beyond do not follow this trend. The deficit in HCN is conventionally
explained by an excess of infrared (IR) radiation due to active galactic nuclei
(AGN). We show in this letter not only that the presence of AGN cannot account
for the excess of IR over molecular luminosity, but also that the observed
abundance of HCN is in fact consistent with a population of stars forming from
near-primordial gas.",2006-06-07T16:33:41Z
Source Mergers and Bubble Growth During Reionization,"The recently introduced models of reionization bubbles based on extended
Press-Schechter theory (Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga & Hernquist 2004) are
generalized to include mergers of ionization sources. Sources with a recent
major merger are taken to have enhanced photon production due to star
formation, and accretion onto a central black hole if a black hole is present.
This produces a scatter in the number of ionized photons corresponding to a
halo of a given mass and a change in photon production over time for any given
halo mass. Photon production histories, bubble distributions, and ionization
histories are computed for several different parameter and recombination
assumptions; the resulting distributions interpolate between previously
calculated limiting cases.",2006-03-16T20:54:49Z
"Kinematics of Interstellar Gas in Nearby UV-Selected Galaxies Measured
  with HST/STIS Spectroscopy","We measure Doppler shifts of interstellar absorption lines in HST/STIS
spectra of individual star clusters in nearby UV-selected galaxies. Values for
systemic velocities, which are needed to quantify outflow speeds, are taken
from the literature, and verified with stellar lines. We detect outflowing gas
in eight of 17 galaxies via low-ionization lines (e.g., CII, SiII, AlII), which
trace cold and/or warm gas. The starbursts in our sample are intermediate in
luminosity (and mass) to dwarf galaxies and luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs),
and we confirm that their outflow speeds (ranging from -100 km/s to nearly -520
km/s with an accuracy of ~80 km/s) are intermediate to those previously
measured in dwarf starbursts and LIRGs. We do not detect the outflow in
high-ionization lines (such as CIV or SiIV); higher quality data will be needed
to empirically establish how velocities vary with the ionization state of the
outflow. We do verify that the low-ionization UV lines and optical NaI doublet
give roughly consistent outflow velocities solidifying an important link
between studies of galactic winds at low and high redshift. To obtain higher
signal-to-noise, we create a local average composite spectrum, and compare it
to the high-z Lyman Break composite spectrum. Surprisingly, the low-ionization
lines show similar outflow velocities in the two samples. We attribute this to
a combination of weighting towards higher luminosities in the local composite,
as well as both samples being on average brighter than the ``turnover''
luminosity in the v-SFR relation.",2006-05-09T02:02:01Z
"Observations of Ultracool dwarfs with ULTRACAM on the VLT: a search for
  weather","We present multi-colour photometry of four field ultracool dwarfs with the
triple-beam photometer ultracam. Data were obtained simultaneously in the
Sloan-g' band and a specially designed narrow-band NaI filter. The previously
reported 1.8-hr period of Kelu-1 is here recovered in the g'-band, but the lack
of any significant variability in the NaI light of this object precludes any
conclusion as to the cause of the variability. 2MASS 2057-0252 and DENIS
1441-0945 show no convincing evidence for variability. 2MASS 1300+1912, on the
other hand, shows good evidence for gradual trends in both bands at the 5%
level. These trends are anti-correlated at a high level of significance, a
result which is incompatible with models of starspot-induced variability. It
would seem likely that dust cloud ""weather"" is responsible for the short-term
variability in this object.",2006-05-09T11:08:16Z
Chandra X-Ray Observatory Observations of Neutron Stars: An Overview,"We present a brief review of Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of
neutron stars. The outstanding spatial and spectral resolution of this great
observatory have allowed for observations of unprecedented clarity and
accuracy. Many of these observations have provided new insights into neutron
star physics. We present an admittedly biased and overly brief overview of
these observations, highlighting some new discoveries made possible by the
Observatory's unique capabilities. We also include our analysis of recent
multiwavelength observations of the putative pulsar and its pulsar-wind nebula
in the IC 443 SNR.",2006-06-29T18:43:17Z
Constraints on the Nature of Jets from kpc Scale X-ray Data,"Motivated by the large number of jets detected by the Chandra X-ray
Observatory, and by the inverse Compton X-ray emission model (IC/CMB) for
relativistic jets, we revisit two basic questions: ``If the medium that carries
the jet's energy consists of hot electrons, can we use the physical length of
the jet to constrain the maximum electron energy?'' and ``Why do jets have
knots?'' Based on the two non-thermal emission processes for X-rays from jets,
we consider constraints on the jet medium and other properties from these two
simple questions. We argue that hot pairs cannot be the dominant constituent of
the medium responsible for the jet's momentum flux and that some mechanisms for
producing fluctuating brightness along jets (rather than a monotonically
decreasing intensity) are precluded by observed jet morphologies.",2006-04-25T20:00:08Z
Temperature Variations and Chemical Abundances in Planetary Nebulae,"In this review we present a brief discussion on the observational evidence in
favor of the presence of temperature variations, and conclude that many
planetary nebulae show spatial temperature variations that are larger than
those predicted by 1D static chemically homogeneous photoionization models. To
determine accurate chemical abundances it is necessary to know the cause of
these temperature variations and several possibilities are discussed. The
importance of this problem is paramount to test the models of stellar evolution
of low and intermediate mass stars and of the chemical evolution of galaxies.
We conclude that the proper abundances for chemically homogeneous PNe are those
derived from recombination lines, while for the two-abundance nebular model the
proper heavy element abundances relative to hydrogen are those derived from
visual and UV collisionally excited lines adopting the t2 values derived from
Te([OIII]) and Te(Balmer)",2006-05-23T17:39:45Z
The periodic variations of a white-light flare observed with ULTRACAM,"High time resolution observations of a white--light flare on the active star
EQ PegB show evidence of intensity variations with a period of approximately 10
s. The period drifts to longer values during the decay phase of the flare. If
the oscillation is interpreted as an impulsively--excited, standing--acoustic
wave in a flare loop, the period implies a loop length of 1.7 Mm and 3.4 Mm for
the case of the fundamental mode and the second harmonic, respectively.
However, the small loop lengths imply a very high modulation depth making the
acoustic interpretation unlikely. A more realistic interpretation may be that
of a fast--MHD wave, with the modulation of the emission being due to the
magnetic field. Alternatively, the variations could be due to a series of
reconnection events. The periodic signature may then arise as a result of the
lateral separation of individual flare loops or current sheets with oscillatory
dynamics (i.e. periodic reconnection).",2006-05-08T11:38:47Z
Cosmological Constraints from Hubble Parameter versus Redshift Data,"We use the Simon, Verde, & Jimenez (2005) determination of the redshift
dependence of the Hubble parameter to constrain cosmological parameters in
three dark energy cosmological models. We consider the standard $\Lambda$CDM
model, the XCDM parameterization of the dark energy equation of state, and a
slowly rolling dark energy scalar field with an inverse power-law potential.
The constraints are restrictive, consistent with those derived from Type Ia
supernova redshift-magnitude data, and complement those from galaxy cluster gas
mass fraction versus redshift data.",2006-07-13T18:32:47Z
The Formation and Evolution of Intracluster Light,"Using N-body simulations, we have modeled the production and evolution of
diffuse, low surface brightness intracluster light (ICL) in three simulated
galaxy clusters. Using an observational definition of ICL to be luminosity at a
surface brightness mu_V>26.5 mag/sq.arcsec, we have found that the fraction of
cluster luminosity contained in ICL generally increases as clusters evolve,
although there are large deviations from this trend over short timescales,
including sustained periods of decreasing ICL luminosity. Most ICL luminosity
increases come in short, discrete events which are highly correlated with group
accretion events within the cluster. In evolved clusters we find that ~10-15%
of the clusters' luminosity is at ICL surface brightness. The morphological
structure of the ICL changes with time, evolving from a complex of filaments
and small-scale, relatively high surface brightness features early in a
cluster's history, to a more diffuse and amorphous cluster-scale ICL envelope
at later times. Finally, we also see a correlation between the evolution of ICL
at different surface brightnesses, including a time delay between the evolution
of faint and extremely faint surface brightness features which is traced to the
differing dynamical timescales in the group and cluster environment.",2006-05-23T21:20:16Z
The compact circumstellar material around OH 231.8+4.2,"We have observed the bipolar post-AGB candidate OH 231.8+4.2, using the
mid-infrared interferometer MIDI and the infrared camera with the adaptive
optics system NACO on the Very Large Telescope. An unresolved core (<200 mas in
FWHM) is found at the center of the OH 231.8+4.2 in the 3.8 micron image. This
compact source is resolved with the interferometer. We used two 8-meter
telescopes with four different baselines, which cover projected baseline
lengths from 62 to 47 meters, and projected position angles from 112 to 131
degrees that are almost perpendicular to the bipolar outflow. Fringes from 8 to
9 micron and from 12 to 13.5 micron were clearly detected, whilst the strong
silicate self-absorption allows only marginal detection of visibilities between
9 and 12 micron. The fringes from the four baselines consistently show the
presence of a compact circumstellar object with an inner radius of 30-40 mas,
which is equivalent to 40-50 AU at 1.3 kpc. This clearly shows that the
mid-infrared compact source is not the central star (3 AU) but circumstellar
material. The measured size of the circumstellar material is consistent with
the size of such disks calculated by hydrodynamic models, implying the
circumstellar material may have a disk configuration.",2006-06-23T02:48:55Z

Substructure in lensing clusters and simulations,"We present high-resolution mass reconstructions for five massive
cluster-lenses spanning a redshift range from $z = 0.18$--0.57 utilising
archival {\it Hubble Space Telescope} ({\it HST}) data and applying
galaxy-galaxy lensing techniques. These detailed mass models were obtained from
the observations by combining constraints from the strong and weak lensing
regimes. We ascribe local weak distortions in the shear maps to perturbations
induced by the presence of galaxy haloes around individual bright early-type
cluster member galaxies. This technique constrains the mass enclosed within an
aperture for these subhaloes. We are sensitive to a specific mass range for
these subhaloes, $10^{11}$ -- $10^{12.5} \msun$, which we associate with
galaxy-scale subhaloes. Adopting a parametric model for the subhaloes, we also
derive their velocity dispersion function and the aperture radius function. The
mass spectrum of substructure in the inner regions of the observed clusters is
directly compared with that in simulated clusters extracted from the {\it
Millennium Simulation}. The massfunction, aperture radii and velocity
dispersion function are compared in detail. Overall, we find good agreement
between the distribution of substructure properties retrieved using the lensing
analysis and those obtained from the simulation (truncated abstract).",2006-04-19T20:03:13Z
The non-constant slope of the CIV Baldwin effect in NGC 4151,"The relationship between the emission-line equivalent width and the continuum
luminosity, so called the Baldwin effect, plays an important role in studying
the physics of the broad line region of AGNs. Using the archived ultraviolet
spectra obtained by IUE, HST, and HUT in 1978-2002, we investigated the
intrinsic CIV Baldwin effect of a well-studied Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151. Both
its continuum flux and CIV emission-line flux varied about two orders of
magnitude in more than two decades, making it one of the best targets for
studying the slope variation of the Baldwin effect. We fitted the CIV line
profile of the 490 archived UV spectra of NGC 4151 with the same model
consisting of a few Gaussian components, and derived the slope in the log-log
plot for the total flux of CIV emission line against the UV continuum flux in
different observation epochs.We found that the slope is not constant for NGC
4151, as it varies from 0.58 in the highest flux epoch to 0.83 in the lowest
flux epoch. The slope evidently decreases as the continuum flux increases,
which reinforces the previous findings of the non-constant slope in the H_beta
Baldwin effect of NGC 5548 and the CIV Baldwin effect of Fairall 9. Our result
suggests that such a non-constant slope may not be unusual for AGNs. Its
physical origin is probably related to the different non-linear responses of
the emission line to the variable ionizing continuum caused by the different
accretion modes at different luminosity levels. We briefly discuss the effects
of various absorption components in the CIV line profile of NGC 4151 and argue
that the slope variation is not driven mainly by the absorption effect.
Intensive, long-term and high resolution spectral observations of strongly
variable AGNs are needed in the future to confirm our result.",2006-05-05T07:53:14Z
Vega is a rapidly rotating star,"Vega, the second brightest star in the northern hemisphere, serves as a
primary spectral type standard. While its spectrum is dominated by broad
hydrogen lines, the narrower lines of the heavy elements suggested slow to
moderate rotation, giving confidence that the ground-based calibration of its
visibile spectrum could be safely extrapolated into the ultraviolet and
near-infrared (through atmosphere models), where it also serves as the primary
photometric calibrator. But there have been problems: the star is too bright
compared to its peers and it has unusually shaped absorption line profiles,
leading some to suggest that it is a distorted, rapidly rotating star seen
pole-on. Here we report optical interferometric observations of Vega which
detect the asymmetric brightness distribution of the bright, slightly offset
polar axis of a star rotating at 93% of breakup speed. In addition to
explaining the unusual brightness and line shape pecularities, this result
leads to the prediction of an excess of near-infrared emission compared to the
visible, in agreement with observations. The large temperature differences
predicted across its surface call into question composition determinations,
adding uncertainty to Vega's age and opening the possibility that its debris
disk could be substantially older than previously thought.",2006-03-20T03:07:27Z
"Deep GEMINI GMOS-IFU spectroscopy of BAL QSOs: I. Decoupling the BAL,
  QSO, starburst, NLR, supergiant bubbles and galactic wind in Mrk 231","In this work we present the first results of a study of BAL QSOs (at low and
high redshift), based on very deep Gemini GMOS integral field spectroscopy. In
particular, the results obtained for the nearest BAL IR QSO Mrk 231 are
presented. Very deep three-dimensional spectra and maps clearly show that the
BAL systems I and II are extended (reaching 1.4-1.6"" = 1.2-1.3 kpc, from the
nucleus) and clearly elongated at the position angle close to the radio jet PA.
Which suggest that the BAL systems I and II are both associated with the radio
jet, and supporting the bipolar jet-wind model for some BALs. For the nuclear
region of Mrk 231, the QSO and host-galaxy components were modelled, using a
new technique of decoupling 3D spectra. From this study, the following main
results were found: (i) in the pure host galaxy spectrum an extreme nuclear
starburst component was clearly observed, mainly as a very strong increase in
the flux, at the blue wavelengths; (ii) the BAL system I is observed in the
spectrum of the host galaxy; (iii) in the clean/pure QSO emission spectrum,
only broad lines were detected. 3D GMOS individual spectra (specially in the IR
Ca II triplet) and maps confirm the presence of an extreme and young nuclear
starburst (8 < age < 15 Myr), which was detected mainly in a ring or toroid
with a radius r = 0.3"" = 200 pc, around the very nucleus. The physical
properties of the four expanding nuclear bubbles were analysed, using the GMOS
3D spectra and maps. These results suggest that an important part of the
nuclear NLR is generated by the OF process and the associated low velocity
ionizing shocks.",2006-07-04T15:16:55Z
"First Results from the CHARA Array VII: Long-Baseline Interferometric
  Measurements of Vega Consistent with a Pole-On, Rapidly Rotating Star","We have obtained high-precision interferometric measurements of Vega with the
CHARA Array and FLUOR beam combiner in the K' band at projected baselines
between 103m and 273m. The measured visibility amplitudes beyond the first lobe
are significantly weaker than expected for a slowly rotating star characterized
by a single effective temperature and surface gravity. Our measurements, when
compared to synthetic visibilities and synthetic spectrophotometry from a
Roche-von Zeipel gravity-darkened model atmosphere, provide strong evidence for
the model of Vega as a rapidly rotating star viewed very nearly pole-on. Our
best fitting model indicates that Vega is rotating at ~91% of its angular
break-up rate with an equatorial velocity of 275 km/s. Together with the
measured vsin(i), this velocity yields an inclination for the rotation axis of
5 degrees. For this model the pole-to-equator effective temperature difference
is 2250 K, a value much larger than previously derived from spectral line
analyses. The derived equatorial T_eff of 7900 K indicates Vega's equatorial
atmosphere may be convective and provides a possible explanation for the
discrepancy. The model has a luminosity of ~37 Lsun, a value 35% lower than
Vega's apparent luminosity based on its bolometric flux and parallax, assuming
a slowly rotating star. The model luminosity is consistent with the mean
absolute magnitude of A0V stars. Our model predicts the spectral energy
distribution of Vega as viewed from its equatorial plane; a model which may be
employed in radiative models for the surrounding debris disk.",2006-03-13T21:13:17Z
"Associated 21-cm HI absorption towards the radio galaxy 3C452
  (J2245+3941)","We report the detection of 21-cm HI absorption towards the core of the
Fanaroff-Riley II radio galaxy 3C452 (J2245+3941). The absorption profile is
well resolved into three components; the strongest and narrowest component
being coincident with the velocity corresponding to [O III] emission lines
while the other two components are blue-shifted with respect to it by ~30 and
115 km\s. If the systemic velocity of the host galaxy is determined from
low-ionization lines, which are red-shifted with respect to the [O III] doublet
by about ~200 km\s, then both the [O III] emission and 21-cm absorption lines
are associated with outflowing material. The neutral hydrogen column density is
estimated to be N(HI) = 6.39X10^{20}(T_s/100)(1.0/f_c) cm^{-2}, where T_s and
f_c are the spin temperature and partial coverage of the background source
respectively. If the 21-cm absorber is also responsible for the nuclear
extinction at infrared wavelengths and x-ray absorption, then for a spin
temperature of ~8000 K, the absorber occults only ~10 per cent of the radio
core.",2006-05-17T19:51:28Z
The superburst recurrence time in luminous persistent LMXBs,"Theory and observations favor stable helium burning as the most important
means to produce fuel for superbursts on neutron star surfaces. However, all
known superbursters exhibit unstable burning as well. This ambiguity prompted
us to search for superbursts in data from the BeppoSAX Wide Field Cameras of
ten luminous LMXBs, most of which do not exhibit normal type-I X-ray bursts. We
found no superbursts and determine a lower limit on the recurrence time which
varies between 30 and 76 days (90% confidence). All recurrence time limits
except one are longer than the observed recurrence time for GX 17+2. This
difference can be understood if the mass accretion rate in GX 17+2 is several
tens of percent higher than in the other sources; alternatively, the accreted
material in GX 17+2 might be hydrogen deficient, leading to larger carbon
yields than in the other sources. We compare our results to the latest models
of superbursts. As our search method is indiscriminate of the burst ignition
scenario, the recurrence time limits may also be applied to other bursts of
similar duration and brightness.",2006-05-28T19:33:05Z
"Optical Counterparts of Ultra-Luminous X-ray Sources identified from
  Archival Hubble Space Telescope/WFPC2","We present a systematic analysis of archival HST WFPC2 ``Association'' data
sets that correlate with the Chandra positions of a set of 44 ultra-luminous
X-ray sources (ULXs) of nearby galaxies. We have improved the Chandra-HST
relative astrometry whenever possible. Disparate numbers of potential ULX
counterparts are found, and in some cases none are found. The lack of or low
number of counterparts in some cases may be due to insufficient depth in the
WFPC2 images. Particularly in late-type galaxies, the HST image in the ULX
region was often complex or crowded. We therefore address various scenarios for
the nature of the ULX since it is not known which, if any, of the sources found
are true counterparts. The optical luminosities of the sources are typically in
the range 10^4-6 L_sun. In several cases color information is available, with
the colors roughly tending to be more red in early-type galaxies. This suggests
that, in general, the (potential) counterparts found in early-type galaxies are
likely to be older stellar populations, and are probably globular clusters.
Several early-type galaxy counterparts have blue colors, which may be due to
younger stellar populations in the host galaxies, however these could also be
background sources. In spiral galaxies the sources may also be due to localized
structure in the disks rather than bound stellar systems. Alternatively some of
the counterparts in late-type galaxies may be isolated supergiant stars. The
observed X-ray/optical flux ratio is diluted by the optical emission of the
cluster in cases where the system is an X-ray binary in a cluster, particularly
in the case of a low-mass X-ray binaries in old cluster. (abridged)",2006-05-22T14:16:10Z
Statistics of the drifting subpulse phenomenon,"We present the statistical results of a systematic, unbiased search for
subpulse modulation of 187 pulsars performed with the Westerbork Synthesis
Radio Telescope (WSRT) in the Netherlands at an observing wavelength of 21 cm
(Weltevrede et al. 2006). We have increased the list of pulsars that show the
drifting subpulse phenomenon by 42, indicating that more than 55% of the
pulsars show this phenomenon. The large number of new drifters we have found
allows us, for the first time, to do meaningful statistics on the drifting
phenomenon. We find that the drifting phenomenon is correlated with the pulsar
age such that drifting is more likely to occur in older pulsars. Pulsars that
drift more coherently seem to be older and have a lower modulation index.
Contrary claims from older studies, both P3 (the repetition period of the
drifting subpulse pattern) and the drift direction are found to be uncorrelated
with other pulsar parameters.",2006-05-08T16:26:52Z
A Detection of [CII] line emission in the z=4.7 QSO BR1202-0725,"We present ~3'' resolution imaging of the z=4.7 QSO BR1202-0725 at 900 micron
from the Submillimeter Array. The two submillimeter continuum components are
clearly resolved from each other, and the positions are consistent with
previous lower frequency images. In addition, we detect [CII] line emission
from the northern component. The ratio of [CII] to far-infrared luminosity is
0.04% for the northern component, and an upper limit of < 0.03% is obtained for
the southern component. These ratios are similar to the low values found in
local ultraluminous galaxies, indicating that the excitation conditions are
different from those found in local field galaxies. X-ray emission is detected
by Chandra from the southern component at
L$_{0.5-2keV}=3\times10^{45}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, and detected at 99.6% confidence
from the northern component at L$_{0.5-2keV}\sim3\times10^{44}$erg~s$^{-1}$,
supporting the idea that BR1202-0725 is a pair of interacting galaxies at z=4.7
that each harbor an active nucleus.",2006-06-02T06:44:06Z
"XMM-Newton Discovery of the X-ray Transient XMMU J181227.8-181234 in the
  Galactic Plane","We report the discovery of an X-ray transient, observed in outburst with
XMM-Newton on March 20, 2003, and with position 18h12m27.8s, -18 12 34 (J2000,
approximate positional error 2""). No known source is present at this position
and the source was not detected during published ROSAT or ASCA observations of
that region. However, the source may be associated with 1H1812-182 detected by
HEAO 1, although the error bars on the HEAO 1 position are very large and the
two sources could also be unrelated. Therefore, we name the source XMMU
J181227.8-181234. Initially, the source was not detected using the All-Sky
Monitor (ASM) on-board the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, however, reprocessing
of the ASM data shows that the source was in fact detected and it was active
for about 50 days. The X-ray spectrum of this transient is fitted equally well
by an absorbed power-law (with a spectral index of 2.5) or multi-colour disk
blackbody model (with kT ~ 2 keV), where we find that the source is highly
absorbed. We detect an unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV flux in the range (2-5)E-9 ergs
cm^{-2} s^{-1}, which at a distance of 8 kpc corresponds to a 0.5-10 keV
luminosity of (1-4)E37 ergs s^{-1}. No pulsations were detected by timing
analysis. A colour-colour diagram from ASM data of different accreting objects
suggests that the transient is a high-mass X-ray binary, as is also suggested
by the high absorption compared to the average interstellar value in the
direction of the source. However, the power-law spectral index is far more
typical of a low-mass X-ray binary. Thus, we are unable to conclusively
identify the nature of the transient. We also report on three sources first
detected by the ASCA Galactic Plane Survey that are close to this transient.",2006-03-27T19:00:16Z
Host galaxies and environments of compact extragalactic radio sources,"The main goal of this thesis is to study the interrelation of powerful radio
sources with their hosts. The objects of study are GPS and CSS sources. Due to
their small size, GPS/CSS sources are excellent probes of this relation.
Furthermore, their young age allows us to compare them to the larger, old radio
sources and establish a time-line evolution of this relation.
  This thesis combines imaging and spectroscopy of GPS/CSS sources at different
wavelengths, and all our studies lead to the same conclusion: the presence and
expansion of powerful radio sources clearly affect the properties and evolution
of their hosts. All chapters of the thesis find evidence of strong interaction
between the host and the radio source. Furthermore, the radio source and host
can significantly affect each others evolution. However, this influence takes
place in different ways. The influence that the host has on the radio source is
somehow indirect. However it can completely change its destiny: depending of
the contents, distribution and density of the gas, the radio source will die
early, expand and grow into the large FR sources, or remain confined inside its
host. In contrast, the influence of the radio source on its host seems to be
more direct and takes place during its expansion through the host: the radio
source will affect the kinematics and ionization of the emission line gas, and
may change the star formation history of the host.",2006-05-20T03:52:38Z
"Gas stripping in galaxy groups - the case of the starburst spiral NGC
  2276","Ram pressure stripping of galactic gas is generally assumed to be inefficient
in galaxy groups due to the relatively low density of the intragroup medium and
the small velocity dispersions of groups. To test this assumption, we obtained
Chandra X-ray data of the starbursting spiral NGC 2276 in the NGC 2300 group of
galaxies, a candidate for a strong galaxy interaction with hot intragroup gas.
The data reveal a shock-like feature along the western edge of the galaxy and a
low-surface-brightness tail extending to the east, similar to the morphology
seen in other wavebands. Spatially resolved spectroscopy shows that the data
are consistent with intragroup gas being pressurized at the leading western
edge of NGC 2276 due to the galaxy moving supersonically through the intragroup
medium at a velocity ~850 km/s. Detailed modelling of the gravitational
potential of NGC 2276 shows that the resulting ram-pressure could significantly
affect the morphology of the outer gas disc but is probably insufficient to
strip large amounts of cold gas from the disc. We estimate the mass loss rates
due to turbulent viscous stripping and starburst outflows being swept back by
ram pressure, showing that both mechanisms could plausibly explain the presence
of the X-ray tail. Comparison to existing HI measurements shows that most of
the gas escaping the galaxy is in a hot phase. With a total mass loss rate of
roughly 5 M_Sun/yr, the galaxy could be losing its entire present HI supply
within a Gyr. This demonstrates that the removal of galactic gas through
interactions with a hot intragroup medium can occur rapidly enough to transform
the morphology of galaxies in groups. Implications of this for galaxy evolution
in groups and clusters are briefly discussed.",2006-04-26T17:46:11Z
"A close look into the carbon disk at the core of the planetary nebula
  CPD-568032","We present high spatial resolution observations of the dusty core of the
Planetary Nebula with Wolf-Rayet central star CPD-568032. These observations
were taken with the mid-infrared interferometer VLTI/MIDI in imaging mode
providing a typical 300 mas resolution and in interferometric mode using
UT2-UT3 47m baseline providing a typical spatial resolution of 20 mas. The
visible HST images exhibit a complex multilobal geometry dominated by faint
lobes. The farthest structures are located at 7"" from the star. The mid-IR
environment of CPD-568032 is dominated by a compact source, barely resolved by
a single UT telescope in a 8.7 micron filter. The infrared core is almost fully
resolved with the three 40-45m projected baselines ranging from -5 to 51 degree
but smooth oscillating fringes at low level have been detected in spectrally
dispersed visibilities. This clear signal is interpreted in terms of a ring
structure which would define the bright inner rim of the equatorial disk.
Geometric models allowed us to derive the main geometrical parameters of the
disk. For instance, a reasonably good fit is reached with an achromatic and
elliptical truncated Gaussian with a radius of 97+/-11 AU, an inclination of
28+/-7 degree and a PA for the major axis at 345+/-7 degree. Furthermore, we
performed some radiative transfer modeling aimed at further constraining the
geometry and mass content of the disk, by taking into account the MIDI
dispersed visibilities, spectra, and the large aperture SED of the source.
These models show that the disk is mostly optically thin in the N band and
highly flared.",2006-06-30T05:00:53Z
Magnetars as cooling neutron stars with internal heating,"We study thermal structure and evolution of magnetars as cooling neutron
stars with a phenomenological heat source in a spherical internal layer. We
explore the location of this layer as well as the heating rate that could
explain high observable thermal luminosities of magnetars and would be
consistent with the energy budget of neutron stars. We conclude that the heat
source should be located in an outer magnetar's crust, at densities rho < 5e11
g/cm^3, and should have the heat intensity of the order of 1e20 erg/s/cm^3.
Otherwise the heat energy is mainly emitted by neutrinos and cannot warm up the
surface.",2006-05-18T11:01:00Z
"Planetesimal formation via fragmentation in self-gravitating
  protoplanetary discs","An unsolved issue in the standard core accretion model for gaseous planet
formation is how kilometre-sized planetesimals form from, initially,
micron-sized dust grains. Solid growth beyond metre sizes can be difficult both
because the sticking efficiency becomes very small, and because these particles
should rapidly migrate into the central star. We consider here how metre-sized
particles evolve in self-gravitating accretion discs using simulations in which
the gravitational influence of the solid particles is also included.
Metre-sized particles become strongly concentrated in the spiral structures
present in the disc and, if the solid to gas density ratio is sufficiently
high, can fragment due to their own self-gravity to form planetesimals
directly. This result suggests that planetesimal formation may occur very early
in the star formation process while discs are still massive enough to be
self-gravitating. The dependence of this process on the surface density of the
solids is also consistent with the observation that extrasolar planets are
preferentially found around high metallicity stars.",2006-07-12T20:01:04Z
"Laboratory Testing of a Lyot Coronagraph Equipped with an Eighth-Order
  Notch Filter Image Mask","We have built a series of notch filter image masks that make the Lyot
coronagraph less susceptible to low-spatial-frequency optical aberrations. In
this paper, we present experimental results of their performance in the lab
using monochromatic light. Our tests show that these ``eighth-order'' masks are
resistant to tilt and focus alignment errors, and can generate contrast levels
of 2 x 10^-6 at 3 lambda/D and 6 x 10^-7 at 10 lambda/D without the use of
corrective optics such as deformable mirrors. This work supports recent
theoretical studies suggesting that eighth-order masks can provide the
Terrestrial Planet Finder Coronagraph with a large search area, high off-axis
throughput, and a practical requisite pointing accuracy.",2006-04-07T15:36:49Z
"Jet Breaks in Short Gamma-Ray Bursts. II: The Collimated Afterglow of
  GRB 051221A","We report the best evidence to date of a jet break in a short Gamma-Ray Burst
(GRB) afterglow, using Chandra and Swift XRT observations of the X-ray
afterglow of GRB 051221A. The combined X-ray light curve, which has three
breaks, is similar to those commonly observed in Swift observations of long
GRBs. A flat segment of the light curve at ~0.1 days after the burst represents
the first clear case of strong energy injection in the external shock of a
short GRB afterglow. The last break occurs at ~4 days post-burst and breaks to
a power-law decay index of ~2. We interpret this as a jet break, with important
implications for models of short GRBs, since it requires collimation of the
afterglow into a jet with an initial opening angle ~4-8 degrees and implies a
total jet kinetic energy of E_jet ~(1-5) x 10^{49} erg. Combined with the lack
of a jet break in GRB 050724, this suggests a wide range in jet collimation in
short GRBs, with at least some having collimation similar to that found in long
GRBs, though with significantly lower jet energies.",2006-04-13T21:20:34Z
UBVRI twilight sky brightness at ESO-Paranal,"Twilight studies have proved to be important tools to analyze the atmospheric
structure with interesting consequences on the characterization of astronomical
sites. Active discussions on this topic have been recently restarted in
connection with the evaluation of Dome C, Antarctica as a potential
astronomical site and several site-testing experiments, including twilight
brightness measurements, are being prepared. The present work provides for the
first time absolute photometric measurements of twilight sky brightness for
ESO-Paranal (Chile), which are meant both as a contribution to the site
monitoring and as reference values in the analysis of other sites, including
Dome C. The UBVRI twilight sky brightness was estimated on more than 2000 FORS1
archival images, which include both flats and standard stars observations taken
in twilight, covering a Sun zenith distance range 94-112 deg. The comparison
with a low altitude site shows that Paranal V twilight sky brightness is about
30% lower, implying that some fraction of multiple scattering has to take place
at an altitude of a few km above the sea level.",2006-04-06T10:16:57Z
"Time Dependent Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer Calculations For
  3-Dimensional Supernova Spectra, Lightcurves, and Polarization","We discuss Monte-Carlo techniques for addressing the 3-dimensional
time-dependent radiative transfer problem in rapidly expanding supernova
atmospheres. The transfer code SEDONA has been developed to calculate the
lightcurves, spectra, and polarization of aspherical supernova models. From the
onset of free-expansion in the supernova ejecta, SEDONA solves the radiative
transfer problem self-consistently, including a detailed treatment of gamma-ray
transfer from radioactive decay and with a radiative equilibrium solution of
the temperature structure. Line fluorescence processes can also be treated
directly. No free parameters need be adjusted in the radiative transfer
calculation, providing a direct link between multi-dimensional hydrodynamical
explosion models and observations. We describe the computational techniques
applied in SEDONA, and verify the code by comparison to existing calculations.
We find that convergence of the Monte Carlo method is rapid and stable even for
complicated multi-dimensional configurations. We also investigate the accuracy
of a few commonly applied approximations in supernova transfer, namely the
stationarity approximation and the two-level atom expansion opacity formalism.",2006-06-06T17:10:05Z
"Generation of density inhomogeneities by magnetohydrodynamic waves in

a high-density contrast by magnetohydrodynamic waves in regions in which the
ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure is small. The initial state is a uniform
background perturbed by fast-mode wave. Our most significant result is that
dense structures persist for far longer in a two-dimensional simulation than in
the one-dimensional case. Once formed, these structures persist as long as the
fast-mode amplitude remains high.",2006-05-10T13:01:09Z
"A Correlation Between Pre-Main Sequence Stellar Rotation Rates and IRAC
  Excesses in Orion","Early observations of T Tauri stars suggested that stars with evidence of
circumstellar accretion disks rotated slower than stars without such evidence,
but more recent results are not as clear. Near-IR circumstellar disk
indicators, though the most widely available, are subject to uncertainties that
can result from inner disk holes and/or the system inclination. Mid-infrared
observations are less sensitive to such effects, but until now, these
observations have been difficult to obtain. The Spitzer Space Telescope now
easily enables mid-infrared measurements of large samples of PMS stars covering
a broad mass range in nearby star-forming regions. Megeath and collaborators
surveyed the Orion Molecular Clouds (~1 Myr) with the IRAC instrument (3.6,
4.5, 5.8, 8 microns) as part of a joint IRAC and MIPS GTO program. We examine
the relationship between rotation and Spitzer mid-IR fluxes for ~900 stars in
Orion for stars between 3 and 0.1 Msun. We find in these Spitzer data the
clearest indication to date that stars with longer periods are more likely than
those with short periods to have IR excesses suggestive of disks.",2006-04-05T17:25:30Z

"Whole Earth Telescope observations of the pulsating subdwarf B star PG
  0014+067","PG 0014+067 is one of the most promising pulsating subdwarf B stars for
seismic analysis, as it has a rich pulsation spectrum. The richness of its
pulsations, however, poses a fundamental challenge to understanding the
pulsations of these stars, as the mode density is too complex to be explained
only with radial and nonradial low degree (l < 3) p-modes without rotational
splittings. One proposed solution, for the case of PG 0014+067 in particular,
assigns some modes with high degree (l=3). On the other hand, theoretical
models of sdB stars suggest that they may retain rapidly rotating cores, and so
the high mode density may result from the presence of a few rotationally-split
triplet (l=1), quintuplet (l=2) modes, along with radial (l=0) p-modes. To
examine alternative theoretical models for these stars, we need better
frequency resolution and denser longitude coverage. Therefore, we observed this
star with the Whole Earth Telescope for two weeks in October 2004. In this
paper we report the results of Whole Earth Telescope observations of the
pulsating subdwarf B star PG 0014+067. We find that the frequencies seen in PG
0014+067 do not appear to fit any theoretical model currently available;
however, we find a simple empirical relation that is able to match all of the
well-determined frequencies in this star.",2006-04-14T17:30:24Z
"A Comprehensive Study of 2 000 Narrow Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies from the
  Sloan Digital Sky Survey: I. The Sample","This is the first paper in a series dedicated to the study of the
emission-line and continuum properties of narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies
(NLS1s). We carried out a systematic search for NLS1s from objects assigned as
``QSOs'' or ``galaxies'' in the spectroscopic sample of the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey Data Release 3 (SDSS DR3) by a careful modeling of their emission lines
and continua. The result is a uniform sample comprising $\sim 2~000$ NLS1. This
sample dramatically increases the number of known NLS1 by a factor of $\sim 10$
over previous compilations. This paper presents the parameters of the prominent
emission lines and continua, which were measured accurately with typical
uncertainties $<10%$. Taking advantage of such an unprecedented large and
uniform sample with accurately measured spectral parameters, we carried out
various statistical analysis, some of which were only possible for the first
time (abbreviated).",2006-03-28T11:28:58Z
"Evolution of the Luminosity-Metallicity-Stellar Mass correlation in a
  hierarchical scenario","We study the evolution of the Stellar Mass-Metallicity Relation and the
Luminosity-Metallicity Relation by performing numerical simulations in a
cosmological framework. We find that the slope and the zero point of the
Luminosity-Metallicity Relation evolve in such a way that, at a given
metallicity, systems were ~3 mag brighter at z=3 compared to galaxies in the
local universe, which is consistent with the observational trend. The local
Stellar Mass-Metallicity Relation shows also a good agreement with recent
observations. We identify a characteristic stellar mass M_c ~ 10^(10.2) M_sun/h
at which the slope of the Stellar Mass-Metallicity Relation decreases for
larger stellar masses. Our results indicate that M_c arises naturally as a
consequence of the hierarchical building up of the structure.",2006-03-02T20:22:49Z
Measurability of vacuum fluctuations and dark energy,"Vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field induce current fluctuations
in resistively shunted Josephson junctions that are measurable in terms of a
physical power spectrum. In this paper we investigate under which conditions
vacuum fluctuations can be gravitationally active, thus contributing to the
dark energy density of the universe. Our central hypothesis is that vacuum
fluctuations are gravitationally active if and only if they are measurable in
terms of a physical power spectrum in a suitable macroscopic or mesoscopic
detector. This hypothesis is consistent with the observed dark energy density
in the universe and offers a resolution of the cosmological constant problem.
Using this hypothesis we show that the observable vacuum energy density rho_vac
in the universe is related to the largest possible critical temperature T_c of
superconductors through rho_vac = sigma (kT_c)^4/(hbar^3 c^3), where sigma is a
small constant of the order 10^-3. This relation can be regarded as an analog
of the Stefan-Boltzmann law for dark energy. Our hypothesis is testable in
Josephson junctions where we predict there should be a cutoff in the measured
spectrum at 1.7 THz if the hypothesis is true.",2006-05-17T15:43:25Z
"Atmospheric scintillation at Dome C, Antarctica: implications for
  photometry and astrometry","We present low-resolution turbulence profiles of the atmosphere above Dome C,
Antarctica, measured with the MASS instrument during 25 nights in March-May
2004. Except for the lowest layer, Dome C has significantly less turbulence
than Cerro Tololo and Cerro Pachon. In particular, the integrated turbulence at
16 km is always less than the median values at the two Chilean sites. From
these profiles we evaluate the photometric noise produced by scintillation, and
the atmospheric contribution to the error budget in narrow-angle differential
astrometry. In comparison with the two mid-latitude sites in Chile, Dome C
offers a potential gain of about 3.6 in both photometric precision (for long
integrations) and narrow-angle astrometry precision. These gain estimates are
preliminary, being computed with average wind-speed profiles, but the validity
of our approach is confirmed by independent data. Although the data from Dome C
cover a fairly limited time frame, they lend strong support to expectations
that Dome C will offer significant advantages for photometric and astrometric
studies.",2006-04-26T08:01:20Z
Saving Planetary Systems: Dead Zones & Planetary Migration,"The tidal interaction between a disk and a planet leads to the planet's
migration. A long-standing question regarding this mechanism is how to stop the
migration before planets plunge into their central stars. In this paper, we
propose a new, simple mechanism to significantly slow down planet migration,
and test the possibility by using a hybrid numerical integrator to simulate the
disk-planet interaction. The key component of the scenario is the role of low
viscosity regions in protostellar disks known as dead zones, which affect
planetary migration in two ways. First of all, it allows a smaller-mass planet
to open a gap, and hence switch the faster type I migration to the slower type
II migration. Secondly, a low viscosity slows down type II migration itself,
because type II migration is directly proportional to the viscosity. We present
numerical simulations of planetary migration by using a hybrid symplectic
integrator-gas dynamics code. Assuming that the disk viscosity parameter inside
the dead zone is (alpha=1e-4-1e-5), we find that, when a low-mass planet (e.g.
1-10 Earth masses) migrates from outside the dead zone, its migration is
stopped due to the mass accumulation inside the dead zone. When a low-mass
planet migrates from inside the dead zone, it opens a gap and slows down its
migration. A massive planet like Jupiter, on the other hand, opens a gap and
slows down inside the dead zone, independent of its initial orbital radius. The
final orbital radius of a Jupiter mass planet depends on the dead zone's
viscosity. For the range of alpha's noted above, this can vary anywhere from 7
AU, to an orbital radius of 0.1 AU that is characteristic of the hot Jupiters.",2006-06-09T16:11:57Z
"Non-Equilibrium Ionization Model for Stellar Cluster Winds and its
  Application","We have developed a self-consistent physical model for super stellar cluster
winds based on combining a 1-D steady-state adiabatic wind solution and a
non-equilibrium ionization calculation. Comparing with the case of collisional
ionization equilibrium, we find that the non-equilibrium ionization effect is
significant in the regime of a high ratio of energy to mass input rate and
manifests in a stronger soft X-ray flux in the inner region of the star
cluster. Implementing the model in X-ray data analysis softwares (e.g., XSPEC)
directly facilitates comparisons with X-ray observations. Physical quantities
such as the mass and energy input rates of stellar winds can be estimated by
fitting observed X-ray spectra. The fitted parameters may then be compared with
independent measurements from other wavelengths. Applying our model to the star
cluster NGC 3603, we find that the wind accounts for no more than 50% of the
total ""diffuse"" emission, and the derived mass input rate and terminal velocity
are comparable to other empirical estimates. The remaining emission most likely
originate from numerous low-mass pre-main-sequence stellar objects.",2006-07-17T20:07:27Z
Spitzer 24 micron Survey of Debris Disks in the Pleiades,"We performed a 24 micron 2 Deg X 1 Deg survey of the Pleiades cluster, using
the MIPS instrument on Spitzer. Fifty four members ranging in spectral type
from B8 to K6 show 24 micron fluxes consistent with bare photospheres. All Be
stars show excesses attributed to free-free emission in their gaseous
envelopes. Five early-type stars and four solar-type stars show excesses
indicative of debris disks. We find a debris disk fraction of 25 % for B-A
members and 10 % for F-K3 ones. These fractions appear intermediate between
those for younger clusters and for the older field stars. They indicate a decay
with age of the frequency of the dust-production events inside the planetary
zone, with similar time scales for solar-mass stars as have been found
previously for A-stars.",2006-06-02T00:25:34Z
"Spectral analyses of eighteen hot H-deficient (pre-) white dwarfs from
  the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4","Context: The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4 has provided spectra of
several new PG 1159 stars and DO white dwarfs. This increase in known hot
H-deficient compact objects significantly improves the statistics and helps to
investigate late stages of stellar evolution. Aims: From the optical SDSS
spectra, effective temperatures and surface gravities are derived in order to
place the observed objects in an evolutionary context. Especially the
connection between PG 1159 stars and DO white dwarfs shall be investigated.
Method: Using our non-LTE model atmospheres and applying chi^2-fitting
techniques, we determine stellar parameters and their errors. We derive total
stellar masses for the DO white dwarfs using model evolutionary tracks.
Results: We confirm three PG 1159 stars, with one showing ultra-high excitation
ion features, and one sdO which we originally classified as a PG 1159 star.
Additionally, we re-analysed the known PG 1159 star, PG 1424+535, with our new
models. Furthermore, we present the first spectral analyses of thirteen DO
white dwarfs, three of which show M-star features in their spectra, while two
display ultra-high excitation ion features.",2006-05-22T09:08:01Z
"Astrophysical Explosions Driven by a Rotating, Magnetized, Gravitating
  Sphere","We present the results of a numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulation that
demonstrates a mechanism by which magnetic fields tap rotational energy of a
stellar core and expel the envelope. Our numerical setup, designed to focus on
the basic physics of the outflow mechanism, consists of a solid, gravitating
sphere, which may represent the compact core of a star, surrounded by an
initially hydrostatic envelope of ionized gas. The core is threaded by a
dipolar magnetic field that also permeates the envelope. At the start of the
simulation, the core begins to rotate at 10% of the escape speed. The magnetic
field is sufficiently strong to drive a magneto-rotational explosion, whereby
the entire envelope is expelled, confirming the expectation of analytical
models. Furthermore, the dipolar nature of the field results in an explosion
that is enhanced simultaneously along the rotation axis (a jet) and along the
magnetic equator. While the initial condition is simplified, the simulation
approximates circumstances that may arise in astrophysical objects such as Type
II supernovae, gamma ray bursts, and proto-planetary nebulae.",2006-06-29T20:19:24Z
"Force-free magnetosphere of an aligned rotator with differential
  rotation of open magnetic field lines","Here we briefly report on results of self-consistent numerical modeling of a
differentially rotating force-free magnetosphere of an aligned rotator. We show
that differential rotation of the open field line zone is significant for
adjusting of the global structure of the magnetosphere to the current density
flowing through the polar cap cascades. We argue that for most pulsars
stationary cascades in the polar cap can not support stationary force-free
configurations of the magnetosphere.",2006-07-09T17:19:22Z
"Mass spectrum of primordial black holes from inflationary perturbation
  in the Randall-Sundrum braneworld: a limit on blue spectra","The mass spectrum of the primordial black holes formed by density
perturbation in the radiation-dominated era of the Randall-Sundrum type-2
cosmology is given. The spectrum coincides with standard four-dimensional one
on large scales but the deviation is apparent on smaller scales. The mass
spectrum is initially softer than standard four-dimensional one, while after
accretion during the earliest era it becomes harder than that. We also show
expected extragalactic diffuse photon background spectra varying the initial
perturbation power-law power spectrum and give constraints on the blue spectra
and/or the reheating temperature. The most recent observations on the small
scale density perturbation from WMAP, SDSS and Lyman-\alpha Forest are used.
What we get are interpreted as constraints on the smaller scale inflation on
the brane connected to the larger one at the scale of Lyman-\alpha Forest. If
we set the bulk curvature radius to be 0.1 mm and assume the reheating
temperature is higher than 10^6 GeV, the scalar spectral index from the smaller
scale inflation is constrained to be n \lesssim 1.3. Typically, the constraints
are tighter than standard four-dimensional one, which is also revised by us
using the most recent observations.",2006-03-19T00:01:40Z

"Comment on: Protecting Life in the Milky Way: Metals Keep the GRBs Away
  by Stanek et al","Stanek et al. (astro-ph/0604113) have noted that the four low-redshift
long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LSB) observed to date all occurred in faint,
metal-poor galaxies. Given this selection, they argue that it is improbable
that there has been a substantial population of Milky Way galaxy bursts
sufficiently recently to affect life on Earth. This argument ignores the
heterogeneity of stellar populations in the Milky Way, with evidence for
continuing mergers with low-metallicity dwarf galaxies; observational analysis
that points to LSBs being hosted by such galaxies undergoing interaction; and
the existence of a likely recent GRB remnant in our galaxy.",2006-04-20T19:53:25Z

atmospheric neutrinos have been recorded by AMANDA and the sensitivity for
cosmic neutrinos has continuously improved. So far no cosmic neutrino signals

"The evolution of the bi-modal colour distribution of galaxies in SDSS
  groups","We analyse $u-r$ colour distributions for several samples of galaxies in
groups drawn from the Fourth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. For
all luminosity ranges and environments considered the colour distributions are
well described by the sum of two Gaussian functions. We find that the fraction
of galaxies in the red sequence is an increasing function of group virial mass.
We also study the evolution of the galaxy colour distributions at low redshift,
$z\le0.18$ in the field and in groups for galaxies brighter than
$M_r-5\log(h)=-20$, finding significant evidence of recent evolution in the
population of galaxies in groups. The fraction of red galaxies monotonically
increases with decreasing redshift, this effect implies a much stronger
evolution of galaxies in groups than in the field.",2006-07-12T20:34:51Z
"The Abundance of Distant and Extremely Red Galaxies: The Role of AGN
  Feedback in Hierarchical Models","We investigate the effect of AGN feedback associated to the bright QSO phase
onto the color distribution of galaxies from z=0 up to z=4. To this aim, we
insert a blast-wave model of AGN feedback in our semi-analytic model of galaxy
formation, which includes the growth of supermassive black holes and the AGN
activity triggered by interactions of the host galaxies. The AGN feedback is
directly related to the impulsive, luminous quasar phase. We test our model by
checking the consistency of its results against i) the QSO luminosity functions
from z=0 to z=4; ii) the observed local relation between the black hole mass
m_{BH} and the mass of the host galaxy. At low redshift the inclusion of AGN
feedback enhances the number of red bright galaxies, so that the color
distribution of M_r<-22 objects is entirely dominated by red (u-r>1.5)
galaxies; at 0.5< z< 2 it yields rest-frame U-V color distribution in agreement
with existing observations. In the range z=1.5-2.5, we find that 31% of
galaxies contribute to the EROs population with m_K<20 (Vega system); at such a
magnitude, the model yields an EROs surface density of 6.3 10^3 /deg^2 matching
existing data; about 80 % of the above density is contributed by passive
galaxies with old stellar populations. Extending our analysis to z=4, the model
matches the observed surface density 1.5 10^3 /deg^2 of DRGs at m_K=20; such a
population is predicted to be dominated by galaxies with old stellar
populations for z>2.5.",2006-05-04T11:32:59Z
Wide-field Corrector for a Gregory Telescope,"A form of prime focus corrector for the Gregory system is proposed that
provides the sub-arcsecond field of view up to 3 degrees in diameter for the
spectral range 0.35-0.90 microns. The corrector includes five lenses made of
same glass (fused silica is preferable). The distinctive feature of the
corrector consists in dissimilar use of the central and edge zones of a front
lens disposed in the exit pupil of a two-mirror system.
  As an example, the f/1.9 telescope is considered with the 6.5-m aperture and
the total length 8.8~m. Its primary and secondary mirrors are pure ellipsoids
close to concave paraboloid and concave sphere, respectively. In the basic
configuration, all surfaces of the corrector are spherical. The diameter of a
star image D_{80} varies from 0''.25 on the optical axis up to 0''.50 at the
edge of the 2.3-deg field. Only slightly worse images shows spherical corrector
for the 2.4-deg field of view. The fraction of vignetted rays grows on 1.7%
from the center of field to its edges. Aspherization of some lens surfaces
allows to reach sub-arcsecond images in the field of 3.0 in diameter.",2006-05-15T14:11:59Z
"All-wavelength Extended Groth strip International Survey: the
  environment of X-ray sources at z~1","We explore the environment of z~1 AGN using a sample of 53 spectroscopically
identified X-ray sources in the All-wavelength Extended Groth strip
International Survey. We quantify the local density in the vicinity of an X-ray
source by measuring the projected surface density of spectroscopically
identified optical galaxies within a radius defined by the 3rd nearest
neighbour. Our main result is that X-ray selected AGN at z~1 avoid underdense
regions at the 99.89% confidence level. Moreover, although we find that the
overall population shares the same (rich) environment with optical galaxies of
similar U-B and M_B, there is also tentative evidence (96%) that AGN with blue
colors (U-B<1) reside in denser environments compared to optical galaxies. We
argue that the results above are a consequence of the whereabouts of massive
galaxies, capable of hosting supermassive black holes at their centers, with
available cold gas reservoirs, the fuel for AGN activity. At z~1 an increasing
fraction of such systems are found in dense regions.",2006-07-12T20:53:14Z
Extinction techniques and impact on dust property determination,"The near infrared extinction powerlaw index ($\beta$) and its uncertainty is
derived from three different techniques based on star counts, colour excess and
a combination of them. We have applied these methods to 2MASS data to determine
maps of $\beta$ and near infrared extinction of the small cloud IC 1396 W. The
combination of star counts and colour excess results in the most reliable
method to determine $\beta$. It is found that the use of the correct
$\beta$-map to transform colour excess values into extinction is fundamental
for column density profile analysis of clouds. We describe how artificial
photometric data, based on the model of stellar population synthesis of the
Galaxy (Robin et al. 2003), can be used to estimate uncertainties and derive
systematic effects of the extinction methods presented here. We find that all
colour excess based extinction determination methods are subject to small but
systematic offsets, which do not affect the star counting technique. These
offsets occur since stars seen through a cloud do not represent the same
population as stars in an extinction free control field.",2006-04-11T13:15:49Z

"Multi-wavelength properties of the high-energy bright Seyfert 1 galaxy
  IGR J18027-1455","A new sample of hard X-ray sources in the Galactic Plane is being revealed by
the regular observations performed by the INTEGRAL satellite. The full
characterization of these sources is mandatory to understand the hard X-ray
sky. Here we report new multifrequency radio, infrared and optical observations
of the source IGR J18027-1455, as well as a multi-wavelength study from radio
to hard X-rays. The radio counterpart of IGR J18027-1455 is not resolved at any
observing frequency. The radio flux density is well fitted by a simple power
law with a spectral index alpha=-0.75+/-0.02. This value is typical of
optically thin non-thermal synchrotron emission originated in a jet. The NIR
and optical spectra show redshifted emission lines with z=0.034, and a broad
Halpha line profile with FWHM ~3400 km/s. This suggests an Active Galactic
Nucleus (AGN) of type 1 as the optical counterpart of IGR J18027-1455. We
confirm the Seyfert 1 nature of the source, which is intrinsically bright at
high energies both in absolute terms and when scaled to a normalized 6 cm
luminosity. Finally, comparing its X-ray luminosity with isotropic indicators,
we find that the source is Compton thin and AGN dominated. This indicates that
INTEGRAL might have just seen the tip of the iceberg, and several tens of such
sources should be unveiled during the course of its lifetime.",2006-06-28T20:07:40Z
"A study on the use of the PACS bolometer arrays for submillimeter
  ground-based telescopes","A new kind of bolometric architecture has been successfully developed for the
PACS photometer onboard the Herschel submillimeter observatory. These new
generation CCD-like arrays are buttable and enable the conception of large
fully sampled focal planes. We present a feasibility study of the adaptation of
these bolometer arrays to ground-based submillimeter telescopes. We have
developed an electro-thermal numerical model to simulate the performances of
the bolometers under specific ground-based conditions (different wavelengths
and background powers for example). This simulation permits to determine the
optimal parameters for each condition and shows that the bolometers can be
background limited in each transmission window between 200 and 450 microns. We
also present a new optical system that enables to have a maximum absorption of
the bolometer in each atmospheric windows. The description of this system and
measurements are showed.",2006-06-19T03:13:38Z
"Accurate Extra-Galactic Distances and Dark Energy: Anchoring the
  Distance Scale with Rotational Parallaxes","We investigate how the uncertainty on the Hubble constant (H_0) affects the
uncertainty in the Equation of State (EOS) of Dark Energy and the total density
of the Universe (Omega_tot). We use the approximate relations between the
cosmological parameters [Spergel etal (2007)] and use error-propagation to
estimate the effects of improving the CMB parameters and H_0 on the EOS of Dark
Energy (DE). First we assume that the additional data does not improve
significantly, but decrease the error on H_0 by a factor <~10. Second, we allow
improved additional data but current H_0 errors (i.e., the DE Task Force case).
In the 1st scenario, improvements of the CMB parameters hardly change the
accuracy of the EOS and Omega_tot, unless H_0 can be measured with an accuracy
of a few %. We find that a combination of moderate improvements for both H_0
and other data significantly constrains the evolution of dark energy, but at a
reduced cost. We review several methods (and their strengths and weaknesses)
that might yield extra-galactic distances with errors of about 1%. We review:
the Velocity Field method, two Maser methods, two Light Echo techniques, the
Binary Star method, and the Rotational Parallax (RP) technique. Because these
methods substantially rely on geometry rather than astrophysics or cosmology,
their results are quite robust. We focus on the advantages of the RP technique
which can provide single-step, bias-free distances to nearby spirals. These
distances can be used to improve the zero-point for other methods which in turn
allow for a much improved H_0 errors. Achieving an accuracy of ~2% in the
distances to M31, M33 and the LMC by the RP method requires proper motions from
future astrometric missions (SIM, GAIA and OBSS, or the SKA).",2006-07-27T10:55:10Z
Deployable Payloads with Starbug,"We explore the range of wide field multi-object instrument concepts taking
advantage of the unique capabilities of the Starbug focal plane positioning
concept. Advances to familiar instrument concepts, such as fiber positioners
and deployable fiber-fed IFUs, are discussed along with image relays and
deployable active sensors. We conceive deployable payloads as components of
systems more traditionally regarded as part of telescope systems rather than
instruments - such as adaptive optics and ADCs. Also presented are some of the
opportunities offered by the truly unique capabilities of Starbug, such as
microtracking to apply intra-field distortion correction during the course of
an observation.",2006-06-14T02:13:26Z
QSO Absorption Lines from QSOs,"We present the results of a search for metal absorption lines in the spectra
of background QSOs whose sightlines pass close to foreground QSOs. We detect
MgII(2796,2803) absorption in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra of four
z>1.5 QSOs whose lines of sight pass within 26-98 kpc of lower redshift
(z~0.5-1.5) QSOs. The 100% [4/4 pairs] detection of MgII in the background QSOs
is clearly at odds with the incidence of associated (z_abs ~ z_em) systems --
absorbers which exist towards only a few percent of QSOs. Although the quality
of our foreground QSO spectra is not as high as the SDSS data, absorption seen
towards one of the background QSOs clearly does not show up at the same
strength in the spectrum of the corresponding foreground QSO. This implies that
the absorbing gas is distributed inhomogeneously around the QSO, presumably as
a direct consequence of the anisotropic emission from the central AGN. We
discuss possible origins for the MgII lines, including: absorption by gas from
the foreground QSO host galaxy; companion galaxies fuelling the QSO through
gravitational interactions; and tidal debris left by galaxy mergers or
interactions which initiated the QSO activity. No single explanation is
entirely satisfactory, and we may well be seeing a mixture of phenomena.",2006-05-30T21:00:46Z
"An Interacting Dark Energy Model for the Expansion History of the
  Universe","We explore a model of interacting dark energy where the dark energy density
is related by the holographic principle to the Hubble parameter, and the decay
of the dark energy into matter occurs at a rate comparable to the current value
of the Hubble parameter. We find this gives a good fit to the observational
data supporting an accelerating Universe, and the model represents a possible
alternative interpretation of the expansion history of the Universe.",2006-06-16T15:42:17Z
"Cut-out sets, fractal voids and cosmic structure","""Cut-out sets"" are fractals that can be obtained by removing a sequence of
disjoint regions from an initial region of d-dimensional euclidean space.
Conversely, a description of some fractals in terms of their void complementary
set is possible. The essential property of a sequence of fractal voids is that
their sizes decrease as a power law, that is, they follow Zipf's law. We prove
the relation between the box dimension of the fractal set (in d <= 3) and the
exponent of the Zipf law for convex voids; namely, if the Zipf law exponent e
is such that 1 < e < d/(d-1) and, in addition, we forbid the appearance of
degenerate void shapes, we prove that the corresponding cut-out set has box
dimension d/e (d-1 < d/e < d). We explore the application of this result to the
large scale distribution of matter in cosmology, in connection with ``cosmic
foam'' models.",2006-03-21T15:39:30Z
"Evidence for Shocked Molecular Gas in the Galactic SNR CTB 109
  (G109.1-1.0)","We report the detection of molecular clouds around the X-ray bright interior
feature in the Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) CTB 109 (G109.1-1.0). This
feature, called the Lobe, has been previously suggested to be the result of an
interaction of the SNR shock wave with a molecular cloud complex. We present
new high resolution X-ray data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and new high
resolution CO data from the Five College Radio Observatory which show the
interaction region with the cloud complex in greater detail. The CO data reveal
three clouds around the Lobe in the velocity interval -57 < v < -52 km s^-1.
The velocity profiles of 12CO at various parts of the east cloud are well fit
with a Gaussian; however, at the position where the CO cloud and the Lobe
overlap, the velocity profile has an additional component towards higher
negative velocities. The molecular hydrogen density in this part of the cloud
is relatively high (N_H2 = 1.9 x 10^20 cm^-2), whereas the foreground
absorption in X-rays (N_H = 4.5 x 10^21 cm^-2), obtained from Chandra data, is
lower than in other parts of the cloud and in the north and south cloud. These
results indicate that this cloud has been hit by the SNR blast wave on the
western side, forming the bright X-ray Lobe.",2006-04-07T14:22:22Z
"High-precision elements of double-lined spectroscopic binaries from
  combined interferometry and spectroscopy. Application to the beta Cephei star
  beta Centauri","We present methodology to derive high-precision estimates of the fundamental
parameters of double-lined spectroscopic binaries. We apply the methods to the
case study of the double-lined beta Cephei star beta Centauri. We also present
a detailed analysis of beta Centauri's line-profile variations caused by its
oscillations. We point out that a systematic error in the orbital amplitudes,
and any quantities derived from them, occurs if the radial velocities of
blended component lines are computed without spectral disentangling. This
technique is an essential ingredient in the derivation of the physical
parameters if the goal is to obtain a precision of only a few percent. We have
devised iteration schemes to obtain the orbital elements for systems whose
lines are blended throughout the orbital cycle. We find the following
parameters for beta Cen: $M_1=10.7\pm 0.1 M_\odot$ and $M_2=10.3\pm 0.1
M_\odot$, an age of $(14.1\pm 0.6)\times 10^6$ years. We deduce two oscillation
frequencies for the broad-lined primary of beta Centauri with degrees higher
than 2. We propose that our iteration schemes be used in any future derivations
of the spectroscopic orbital parameters of double-lined binaries with blended
component lines to which disentangling can be successfully applied.",2006-05-09T08:05:10Z
"Supermassive black hole formation during the assembly of pre-galactic
  discs","In this paper we discuss the evolution of gravitationally unstable
pre-galactic discs that result from the collapse of haloes at high redshift $z
\approx 10$ or so, which have not yet been enriched by metals. In cases where
molecular hydrogen formation is suppressed the discs are maintained at a
temperature of a few thousand degrees Kelvin. However, when molecular hydrogen
is present cooling can proceed down to a few hundred degrees Kelvin. Analogous
to the case of the larger scale proto-galactic discs, we assume that the
evolution of these discs is mainly driven by angular momentum redistribution
induced by the development of gravitational instabilities in the disc. We also
properly take into account the possibility of disc fragmentation. We thus show
that this simple model naturally predicts the formation of supermassive black
holes in the nuclei of such discs and provides a robust determination of their
mass distribution as a function of halo properties. We estimate that roughly 5%
of discs resulting from the collapse of haloes with $M\approx 10^7 M_{\odot}$
should host a massive black hole with a mass $M_{\rm BH}\approx 10^5
M_{\odot}$. We confirm our arguments with time-dependent calculations of the
evolution of the surface density and of the accretion rate in these primordial
discs. This mechanism offers an efficient way to form seed black holes at high
redshift. The predicted masses for our black hole seeds enable the comfortable
assembly of $10^9 M_{\odot}$ black holes powering the luminous quasars detected
by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at $z = 6$ for a concordance cosmology.

Black-Hole Accretion Disc as an Analogue Gravity Model,"We formulate and solve the equations governing the transonic behaviour of a
general relativistic black-hole accretion disc with non-zero advection
velocity. We demonstrate that a relativistic Rankine-Hugoniot shock may form
leading to the formation of accretion powered outflow. We show that the
critical points of transonic discs generally do not coincide with the
corresponding sonic points. The collection of such sonic points forms an
axisymmetric hypersurface, generators of which are the acoustic null geodesics,
i.e. the phonon trajectories. Such a surface is shown to be identical with an
acoustic event horizon. The acoustic surface gravity and the corresponding
analogue horizon temperature $T_{AH}$ at the acoustic horizon are then computed
in terms of fundamental accretion parameters. Physically, the analogue
temperature is associated with the thermal phonon radiation analogous to the
Hawking radiation of the black-hole horizon.Thus, an axisymmetric black-hole
accretion disc is established as a natural example of the classical analogue
gravity model, for which two kinds of horizon exist simultaneously. We have
shown that for some values of astrophysically relevant accretion parameters,
the analogue temperature exceeds the corresponding Hawking temperature. We
point out that acoustic {\it white holes} can also be generated for a
multi-transonic black-hole accretion with a shock. Such a white hole, produced

inner and the outer sonic points. Finally, we discuss possible applications of
our work to other astrophysical events which may exhibit analogue effects.",2006-04-21T20:12:21Z
"Refining a relativistic, hydrodynamic solver: Admitting
  ultra-relativistic flows","We have undertaken the simulation of hydrodynamic flows with bulk Lorentz
factors in the range 10^2--10^6. We discuss the application of an existing
relativistic, hydrodynamic primitive-variable recovery algorithm to a study of
pulsar winds, and, in particular, the refinement made to admit such
ultra-relativistic flows. We show that an iterative quartic root finder breaks
down for Lorentz factors above 10^2 and employ an analytic root finder as a
solution. We find that the former, which is known to be robust for Lorentz
factors up to at least 50, offers a 24% speed advantage. We demonstrate the
existence of a simple diagnostic allowing for a hybrid primitives recovery
algorithm that includes an automatic, real-time toggle between the iterative
and analytical methods. We further determine the accuracy of the iterative and
hybrid algorithms for a comprehensive selection of input parameters and
demonstrate the latter's capability to elucidate the internal structure of
ultra-relativistic plasmas. In particular, we discuss simulations showing that
the interaction of a light, ultra-relativistic pulsar wind with a slow, dense
ambient medium can give rise to asymmetry reminiscent of the Guitar nebula
leading to the formation of a relativistic backflow harboring a series of
internal shockwaves. The shockwaves provide thermalized energy that is
available for the continued inflation of the PWN bubble. In turn, the bubble
enhances the asymmetry, thereby providing positive feedback to the backflow.",2006-05-31T22:12:38Z
"Search for Diffuse Astrophysical Neutrino Flux Using Ultra-High-Energy
  Upward-Going Muons in Super-Kamiokande I","Many astrophysical models predict a diffuse flux of high-energy neutrinos
from active galactic nuclei and other extra-galactic sources. At muon energies
above 1 TeV, the upward-going muon flux induced by neutrinos from active
galactic nuclei is expected to exceed the flux due to atmospheric neutrinos. We
have performed a search for this astrophysical neutrino flux by looking for
upward-going muons in the highest energy data sample from the Super-Kamiokande
detector using 1679.6 live days of data. We found one extremely high energy
upward-going muon event, compared with an expected atmospheric neutrino
background of 0.46 plus or minus 0.23 events. Using this result, we set an
upper limit on the diffuse flux of upward-going muons due to neutrinos from
astrophysical sources in the muon energy range 3.16-100 TeV.",2006-06-06T21:56:04Z
"The CMB Initial Data and Fundamental Operator Quantization of General
  Relativity","The observational data on CMB radiation revealed that our Universe can be an
ordinary physical object moving with respect to the Earth observer with the
occasional initial data. This fact allows us to apply the theory of irreducible
unitary representations of the Poincare group in order to describe the Universe
in the framework of the fundamental operator quantization of General Relatvity
and Standard Model of elementary particles. The simplest fit of the
observational CMB data is given that includes occasional gauge-invariant and
frame-covariant initial data and their units of measurement.",2006-04-10T11:37:49Z
The atypical emission-line star Hen3-209,"We analyse observations, spanning 15 years, dedicated to the extreme
emission-line object Hen3-209. Our photometric data indicate that the
luminosity of the star undergoes marked variations with a peak-to-peak
amplitude of 0.65mag. These variations are recurrent, with a period of
16.093+-0.005d. The spectrum of Hen3-209 is peculiar with many different lines
(HI, HeI, FeII,...) showing P Cygni profiles. The line profiles are apparently
changing in harmony with the photometry. The spectrum also contains [OIII]
lines that display a saddle profile topped by three peaks, with a maximum
separation of about 600km/s. Hen3-209 is most likely an evolved luminous object
suffering from mass ejection events and maybe belonging to a binary system.",2006-06-26T15:32:31Z
Heating of the Solar Corona by Dissipative Alfven Solitons,"Solar photospheric convection drives myriads of dissipative Alfven solitons
(hereinafter called alfvenons) capable of accelerating electrons and ions to
energies of hundreds of keV and producing the X-ray corona. Alfvenons are exact
solutions of two-fluid equations for a collisionless plasma and represent
natural accelerators for conversion of the electromagnetic energy flux driven
by convective flows into kinetic energy of charged particles in space and
astrophysical plasmas. Their properties have been experimentally verified in
the magnetosphere, where they accelerate auroral electrons to tens of keV.",2006-04-25T07:14:01Z
"Evolutionary Implications from SDSSJ085338.27+033246.1: A Spectacular N
  arrow-Line Seyfert 1 Galaxy with Young Post-starburst","We analyze the physical properties of post-starburst AGN SDSS
J085338.27+033246.1 according to its optical spectrum and discuss its
implications on AGN's evolution. The spectra PCA method is developed to extract
emission lines and absorption features from the total light spectrum. The
emission-line analysis indicates that the object can be classified as a NLS1
with FeII/H$\beta_{\rm{B}}=2.4\pm0.2$, large Eddington ratio ($\sim0.34$),
small black hole mass ($\sim1.1\times10^{7}M_{\odot}$) and intermediately
strong radio emission. A simple SSP model indicates that the absorption
features are reproduced by a $\sim$100 Myr old starburst with a mass of
$\sim7\times10^{9}M_{\odot}$ rather well. The current SFR
$\sim3.0M_{\odot}\rm{yr^{-1}}$ inferred from the [OII] emission is much smaller
than the past average SFR$\sim70M_{\odot}\rm{yr^{-1}}$, however. The line ratio
diagnosis using the BPT diagrams indicates that the narrow emission lines are
almost entirely emitted from HII regions. We further discuss a possible
evolutionary path that links AGN and starburst phenomena.",2006-05-16T03:02:50Z
"A compact dusty disk around the Herbig Ae star HR 5999 resolved with
  VLTI / MIDI","We have used mid-infrared long-baseline interferometry with MIDI at the VLTI
to resolve the circumstellar material around the Herbig Ae star HR 5999,
providing the first direct measurement of its angular size, and to derive
constraints on the spatial distribution of the dust. A set of ten spectrally
dispersed (8-13 micron) interferometric measurements of HR 5999 was obtained.
The characteristic size of the emission region depends on the projected
baseline length and position angle, and it ranges between ~ 5-15
milliarcseconds (Gauss FWHM), corresponding to remarkably small physical sizes
of ~ 1-3 AU. To derive constraints on the geometrical distribution of the dust,
we compared our interferometric measurements to 2D, frequency-dependent
radiation transfer simulations of circumstellar disks and envelopes. For disk
models with radial power-law density distributions, the relatively weak but
very extended emission from outer disk regions (>~ 3 AU) leads to model
visibilities that are significantly lower than the observed visibilities,
making these models inconsistent with the MIDI data. Disk models in which the
density is truncated at outer radii of ~ 2-3 AU, on the other hand, provide
good agreement with the data. A satisfactory fit to the observed MIDI
visibilities of HR 5999 is found with a model of a geometrically thin disk that
is truncated at 2.6 AU and seen under an inclination angle of 58 degr. Neither
models of a geometrically thin disk seen nearly edge-on, nor models of
spherical dust shells can achieve agreement between the observed and predicted
visibilities. The reason why the disk is so compact remains unclear; we
speculate that it has been truncated by a close binary companion.",2006-07-21T09:06:08Z
Radio Spectrum and Distance of the SNR HB9,"New images are presented of the supernova remnant (SNR) HB9 based on 408 MHz
and 1420 MHz continuum emission and HI-line emission data of the Canadian
Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS) by the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory
(DRAO). Two methods of spectral index analysis for HB9 are presented and
compared: one removes compact sources at both frequencies but is limited to the
resolution of the 408 MHz image; the other removes compact sources only in the
1420 MHz image so is effective at higher spatial resolution. The second allows
more detailed spectral index variation studies than the first. The two T-T plot
methods and new integrated flux densities give spectral index
(S_{\nu}\propto\nu^{-alpha}) for the whole of HB9 of 0.48+-0.03; and
0.47+-0.06, respectively. These are lower than previous spectral index for HB9
(alpha=0.61). Spatial variations of spectral index are derived using the second
method and yield a steeper spectral index for interior regions than for the
rim. This can be explained by a standard curved interstellar electron energy
spectrum combined with lower interior magnetic field compared to that near the
outer shock, which results in a larger proportion of steep spectrum emission
for lines-of-sight through the central body of the SNR. HI observations show
structures probably associated with the SNR in the radial velocity range -3 to
-9 km/s and suggest a distance of 0.8+-0.4 kpc for the SNR. This is consistent
with the distance to the radio pulsar 0458+46, offset from the center of HB9 by
23'. However the pulsar spindown and kinematic ages are significantly greater
than estimates of the SNR age: the Sedov age for HB9 is 6600 yr and the
evaporative cloud model yields ages of 4000-7,000 yr.",2006-06-23T18:43:43Z
"Abundance Anomalies in Galactic Globular Clusters - Looking for the
  Stellar Culprits","Galactic globular cluster stars exhibit abundance patterns which are not
shared by their field counterparts. It is clear from recent spectroscopic
observations of GC turnoff stars that these abundance anomalies were already
present in the gas from which the observed stars formed. This provides
undisputed support to the so-called self-enrichment scenario according to which
a large fraction of GC low-mass stars have formed from material processed
through hydrogen-burning at high temperatures and then lost by more massive and
faster evolving stars (and perhaps mixed with some original gas). Within this
framework we present a new method to derive the Initial Mass Function of the
polluter stars.",2006-06-09T07:43:17Z
Exact versus approximate beaming formulas in Gamma-Ray Burst afterglows,"We present the exact analytic expressions to compute, assuming the emitted
Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) radiation is not spherically symmetric but is confined
into a narrow jet, the value of the detector arrival time at which we start to
""see"" the sides of the jet, both in the fully radiative and adiabatic regimes.
We obtain this result using our exact analytic expressions for the EQuiTemporal
Surfaces (EQTSs) in GRB afterglows. We re-examine the validity of three
different approximate formulas currently adopted for the adiabatic regime in
the GRB literature. We also present an empirical fit of the numerical solutions
of the exact equations, compared and contrasted with the three above
approximate formulas. The extent of the differences is such as to require a
reassessment on the existence and entity of beaming in the cases considered in
the current literature, as well as on its consequences on the GRB energetics.",2006-05-12T23:14:23Z
The Role of Pressure in GMC Formation II: The H_2 - Pressure Relation,"We show that the ratio of molecular to atomic gas in galaxies is determined
by hydrostatic pressure and that the relation between the two is nearly linear.
The pressure relation is shown to be good over three orders of magnitude for 14
galaxies including dwarfs, HI-rich, and H_2-rich galaxies as well as the Milky
Way. The sample spans a factor of five in mean metallicity. The rms scatter of
individual points of the relation is only about a factor of two for all the
galaxies, though some show much more scatter than others. Using these results,
we propose a modified star formation prescription based on pressure determining
the degree to which the ISM is molecular. The formulation is different in high
and low pressure regimes defined by whether the gas is primarily atomic or
primarily molecular. This formulation can be implemented in simulations and
provides a more appropriate treatment of the outer regions of spiral galaxies
and molecule-poor systems such as dwarf irregulars and damped Lyman-alpha
systems.",2006-05-01T20:00:01Z
Perspectives of High Energy Neutrino Astronomy,"This work discusses the perspectives to observe fluxes of high energy
astrophysical neutrinos with the planned km3 telescopes. On the basis of the
observations of GeV and TeV gamma-rays, and of ultra high energy cosmic rays,
it is possible to construct well motivated predictions that indicate that the
discovery of such fluxes is probable. However the range of these predictions is
broad, and the very important opening of the ``neutrino window'' on the high
energy universe is not guaranteed with the current design of the detectors. The
problem of enlarging the detector acceptance using the same (water/ice
Cherenkov) or alternative (acoustic/radio) techniques is therefore of central
importance.",2006-05-21T15:20:20Z
"A Time Delay for the Largest Gravitationally Lensed Quasar: SDSS
  J1004+4112","We present 426 epochs of optical monitoring data spanning 1000 days from
December 2003 to June 2006 for the gravitationally lensed quasar SDSS
J1004+4112. The time delay between the A and B images is 38.4+/-2.0 days in the
expected sense that B leads A and the overall time ordering is C-B-A-D-E. The
measured delay invalidates all published models. The models failed because they
neglected the perturbations from cluster member galaxies. Models including the
galaxies can fit the data well, but strong conclusions about the cluster mass
distribution should await the measurement of the longer, and less substructure
sensitive, delays of the C and D images. For these images, a CB delay of
681+/-15 days is plausible but requires confirmation, while CB and AD delays of
>560 days and > 800 days are required. We clearly detect microlensing of the
A/B images, with the delay-corrected flux ratios changing from B-A=0.44+/-0.01
mag in the first season to 0.29+/-0.01 mag in the second season and 0.32+/-0.01
mag in the third season.",2006-07-21T20:05:20Z
"A Comprehensive Search for Gamma-Ray Lines in the First Year of Data
  from the INTEGRAL Spectrometer","We have carried out an extensive search for gamma-ray lines in the first year
of public data from the Spectrometer (SPI) on the INTEGRAL mission. INTEGRAL
has spent a large fraction of its observing time in the Galactic Plane with
particular concentration in the Galactic Center (GC) region (~ 3 Msec in the
first year). Hence the most sensitive search regions are in the Galactic Plane
and Center. The phase space of the search spans the energy range 20-8000 keV
and line widths from 0-1000 keV (FWHM). It includes both diffuse and point-like
emission. We have searched for variable emission on time scales down to ~ 1000
sec. Diffuse emission has been searched for on a range of different spatial
scales from ~ 20 deg (the approximate field-of-view of the spectrometer) up to
the entire Galactic Plane. Our search procedures were verified by the recovery
of the known gamma-ray lines at 511 keV and 1809 keV at the appropriate
intensities and significances. We find no evidence for any previously unknown
gamma-ray lines. The upper limits range from a few x 10^-5 cm^-2 s^-1 to a few
x 10^-2 cm^-2 s^-1 depending on line width, energy and exposure; regions of
strong instrumental background lines were excluded from the search. Comparison
is made between our results and various prior predictions of astrophysical
lines.",2006-04-12T17:44:35Z
"Cut-out sets, fractal voids and cosmic structure","""Cut-out sets"" are fractals that can be obtained by removing a sequence of
disjoint regions from an initial region of d-dimensional euclidean space.
Conversely, a description of some fractals in terms of their void complementary
set is possible. The essential property of a sequence of fractal voids is that
their sizes decrease as a power law, that is, they follow Zipf's law. We prove
the relation between the box dimension of the fractal set (in d <= 3) and the
exponent of the Zipf law for convex voids; namely, if the Zipf law exponent e
is such that 1 < e < d/(d-1) and, in addition, we forbid the appearance of
degenerate void shapes, we prove that the corresponding cut-out set has box
dimension d/e (d-1 < d/e < d). We explore the application of this result to the
large scale distribution of matter in cosmology, in connection with ``cosmic
foam'' models.",2006-03-21T15:39:30Z
Enrichment in the Centaurus cluster of galaxies,"We perform a detailed spatially-resolved, spectroscopic, analysis of the core
of the Centaurus cluster of galaxies using a deep Chandra X-ray observation and
XMM-Newton data. The Centaurus cluster core has particularly high metallicity,
upto twice Solar values, and we measure the abundances of Fe, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S,
Ar, Ca and Ni. We map the distribution of these elements in many spatial
regions,and create radial profiles to the east and west of the centre. The
ratios of the most robustly determined elements to iron are consistent with
Solar ratios, indicating that there has been enrichment by both Type Ia and
Type II supernovae. For a normal initial stellar mass function it represents
the products of about 4x10^10 solar masses of star formation. This star
formation can have occured either continuously at a rate of 5 solar masses per
year for the past 8 Gyr or more,or was part of the formation of the central
galaxy at earlier times. Either conclusion requires that the inner core of the
Centaurus cluster has not suffered a major disruption within the past 8 Gyr, or
even longer.",2006-07-06T15:33:22Z
The Red Halo Phenomenon,"Optical and near-IR observations of the halos of disk galaxies and blue
compact galaxies have revealed a very red spectral energy distribution, which
cannot easily be reconciled with a normal, metal-poor stellar population like
that in the stellar halo of the Milky Way. Here, spectral evolutionary models
are used to explore the consequences of these observations. We demonstrate that
a stellar population of low to intermediate metallicity, but with an extremely
bottom-heavy initial mass function, can explain the red halos around both types
of objects. Other previously suggested explanations, like nebular emission or
very metal-rich stars, are shown to fail in this respect. This indicates that,
if the reported halo colours are correct, halo populations dominated by
low-mass stars may be a phenomenon common to galaxies of very different Hubble
types. Potential tests of this hypothesis are discussed, along with its
implications for the baryonic dark matter content of galaxies.",2006-06-09T06:11:43Z
"Basic considerations about experimental approaches to the B-mode of the
  CMB Polarization","The B-mode detection of Cosmic Microwave Background polarization will require
new technological developments, able to get sensitivities at least 2 orders of
magnitude better than for the E-mode. This really ambitious goal cannot be
reached simply by either improving the present technology or by adding more
detectors to current design, at least in the frame of having a new space
mission operating within a decade. Thus, the scientific community have to take
important decisions about the most suitable technologies on which converge the
needed effort. Basically, at present two receiver families do exist: bolometric
and radiometric. Both of them are continuoulsly improving their basic
performances, but the optimal approach to B-modes may require some decisions
have to be taken in short time scale. In any case, radiometric and bolometric
receivers have to deal with some common sources of systematics as well as they
both require some cryogenics. Thus, we should expect that systematics and
cryogenics may play as watershed line in designing future experiments aimed at
measuring the B-mode of Cosmic Microwave Background.",2006-04-07T15:56:08Z
"Observational evidence for AGN fueling. I. The merging of NGC6104 with a
  companion","We investigate in details the kinematics and morphology of the Seyfert galaxy
NGC6104 in order to identify the mechanism of gas transportation to the active
galactic nucleus (AGN). Our observational data were obtained at the 6-m Special
Astrophysical Observatory telescope with the MPFS integral-field spectrograph
and the SCORPIO universal device in three modes: direct imaging, a scanning
Fabry-Perot interferometer, and long-slit spectroscopy. Images from the HST
archive were invoked to study the structure of the circumnuclear region. An
analysis of deep images has revealed that NGC6104 is in the phase of active
merging with a companion galaxy. We have been able to study the detailed
picture of ionized gas motions up to galactocentric distances of 14 kpc and to
construct the stellar velocity field for the inner region. The radial gas
motions toward the AGN along the central bar play a significant role at
galactocentric distances of 1-5 kpc. In addition, we have detected an outflow
of ionized gas from the nucleus that presumably resulted from the intrusion of
a radio jet into the ambient interstellar medium. Using diagnostic diagrams, we
estimate the contributions from the AGN and star formation to the galactic gas
ionization. We estimate the bar pattern speed by the Tremaine-Weinberg method
and show that the inner ring observed in the galactic images has a resonant
nature. Two possible ring formation scenarios (before and during the
interaction with a companion) are discussed.",2006-07-08T18:36:57Z
CMB quadrupole suppression: II. The early fast roll stage,"Within the effective field theory of inflation, an initialization of the
classical dynamics of the inflaton with approximate equipartition between the
kinetic and potential energy of the inflaton leads to a brief fast roll stage
that precedes the slow roll regime. The fast roll stage leads to an attractive
potential in the wave equations for the mode functions of curvature and tensor
perturbations. The evolution of the inflationary perturbations is equivalent to
the scattering by this potential and a useful dictionary between the scattering
data and observables is established.Implementing methods from scattering theory
we prove that this attractive potential leads to a suppression of the
quadrupole moment for CMB and B-mode angular power spectra. The scale of the
potential is determined by the Hubble parameter during slow roll. Within the
effective field theory of inflation at the grand unification (GUT) energy scale
we find that if inflation lasts a total number of efolds N_{tot} ~ 59, there is
a 10-20% suppression of the CMB quadrupole and about 2-4% suppression of the
tensor quadrupole. The suppression of higher multipoles is smaller, falling off
as 1/l^2. The suppression is much smaller for N_{tot} > 59, therefore if the
observable suppression originates in the fast roll stage, there is the upper
bound N_{tot} ~ 59.",2006-07-21T16:55:56Z
Predicting the Starquakes in PSR J0537-6910,"We report on more than 7 years of monitoring of PSR J0537-6910, the 16 ms
pulsar in the Large Magellanic Cloud, using data acquired with the RXTE. During
this campaign the pulsar experienced 23 sudden increases in frequency
(``glitches'') amounting to a total gain of over six ppm of rotation frequency
superposed on its gradual spindown of d(nu)/d(t) = -2e-10 Hz/s. The time
interval from one glitch to the next obeys a strong linear correlation to the
amplitude of the first glitch, with a mean slope of about 400 days ppm (6.5
days per uHz), such that these intervals can be predicted to within a few days,
an accuracy which has never before been seen in any other pulsar. There appears
to be an upper limit of ~40 uHz for the size of glitches in_all_ pulsars, with
the 1999 April glitch of J0537 as the largest so far. The change in the
spindown of J0537 across the glitches, Delta(d(nu)/d(t)), appears to have the
same hard lower limit of -1.5e-13 Hz/s, as, again, that observed in all other
pulsars. The spindown continues to increase in the long term,
d(d(nu)/d(t))/d(t) = -1e-21 Hz/s/s, and thus the timing age of J0537 (-0.5 nu
d(nu)/d(t)) continues to decrease at a rate of nearly one year every year,
consistent with movement of its magnetic moment away from its rotational axis
by one radian every 10,000 years, or about one meter per year. J0537 was likely
to have been born as a nearly-aligned rotator spinning at 75-80 Hz, with a
|d(nu)/d(t)| considerably smaller than its current value of 2e-10 Hz/s. The
pulse profile of J0537 consists of a single pulse which is found to be flat at
its peak for at least 0.02 cycles.",2006-05-01T19:57:48Z
"The Nainital-Cape Survey -- II:Report for pulsation in five chemically
  peculiar A-type stars and presentation of 140 null results","To search photometric variability in chemically peculiar A type stars in the
northern hemisphere. High-speed photometric observations of Ap and Am star
candidates have been carried out from ARIES (Manora Peak, Nainital) using a
three-channel fast photometer attached to the ARIES 104-cm Sampurnanand
telescope. This paper presents three new variables: HD 113878, HD 118660 and HD
207561. During the time span of the survey (1999 December to 2004 January)
pulsations of the $\delta$ Sct type were also found for the two evolved Am
stars HD 102480 and HD 98851, as reported in Joshi et al. (2002, 2003).
Additionally, we present 140 null results of the survey for this time span. The
star HD 113878 pulsates with a period of 2.31 hr, which is typical of $\delta$
Sct stars. HD 118660 exhibits multi-periodic variability with a prominent
period of nearly 1 hr. These periods need to be investigated and make HD 118660
a particularly interesting target for further observations. For HD 207561, a
star classified as Am, a probable pulsation with a period of 6 min was found in
the light curves obtained on two consecutive nights. Both HD 102480 and HD
98851 exhibit unusual alternating high and low amplitude maxima, with a period
ratio of 2:1. The analysis of the null results confirms the photometric quality
of the Nainital",2006-05-18T07:32:01Z
"Radio observations of comet 9P/Tempel 1 with the Australia Telescope
  facilities during the Deep Impact encounter","We present radio observations of comet 9P/Tempel 1 associated with the Deep
Impact spacecraft collision of 2005 July 4. Weak 18-cm OH emission was detected
with the Parkes 64-m telescope, in data averaged over July 4 to 6, at a level
of 12 +/- 3 mJy km/s, corresponding to OH production rate 2.8 x 10^{28}
molecules/second (Despois et al. inversion model, or 1.0 x 10^{28} /s for the
Schleicher & A'Hearn model). We did not detect the HCN 1-0 line with the Mopra
22-m telescope over the period July 2 to 6. The 3 sigma limit of 0.06 K km/s
for HCN on July 4 after the impact gives the limit to the HCN production rate
of < 1.8 x 10^{25} /s. We did not detect the HCN 1-0 line, 6.7 GHz CH_3OH line
or 3.4-mm continuum with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) on July
4, giving further limits on any small-scale structure due to an outburst. The 3
sigma limit on HCN emission of 2.5 K km/s from the ATCA around impact
corresponds to limit < 4 x 10^{29} HCN molecules released by the impact.",2006-04-24T08:38:12Z
Quantitative X-ray spectroscopy of massive stars,"Radiative transfer in a clumped winds is used to describe X-ray emission line
profiles observed in the XMM-Newton RGS spectrum of the OI star Zeta Puppis. It
is shown that this X-ray spectrum can be explained as originating from a
multi-temperature collisional plasma located in the wind acceleration zone. The
X-rays are attenuated in the clumped stellar wind, which gives characteristic
profiles to the emergent lines. We specifically study the N VII emission line
in the spectrum of Zeta Pup. Long RGS exposures reveal that the N VII line
profile is structured. On the basis of our Zeta Pup atmosphere model, we rule
out the presence of N VII in the cool wind component. We suggest that the
detailed N VII line structure is due to self-absorption in the hot plasma. Wind
clumping also affects the transfer of ionizing radiation in high-mass X-ray
binaries (HMXBs). We derive analytical formulae for the ionisation parameter in
dependence on the parameters of wind clumping.",2006-05-22T13:56:44Z
"Neutrino Spectra from Low and High Luminosity Populations of Gamma Ray
  Bursts","The detection of GRB 060218 at z=0.033 by {\em Swift} within 1.5 years of
operation, together with the detection of GRB 980425 at $z=0.0085$ by BeppoSAX,
suggest that these low-luminosity (LL) GRBs have a much higher event rate than
the canonical high-luminosity (HL) GRBs, and they form a distinct new component
in the GRB luminosity function. We explore the contribution of this previously
neglected GRB population to the diffuse neutrino background within the internal
shock model and compare it with that of the canonical HL population. By
considering a wide range of distributions of various parameters (e.g.
luminosity, spectral break energy, duration, variability time, Lorentz factor,
redshift) for both populations, we find that although it is difficult to detect
neutrinos from the individual LL GRBs, the contribution of the LL population to
the diffuse neutrino background is more than the HL population above about
$10^{8}$ GeV.",2006-06-30T02:03:40Z
"The Search for other Earths: limits on the giant planet orbits that
  allow habitable terrestrial planets to form","Gas giant planets are far easier than terrestrial planets to detect around
other stars, and are thought to form much more quickly than terrestrial
planets. Thus, in systems with giant planets, the late stages of terrestrial
planet formation are strongly affected by the giant planets' dynamical
presence. Observations of giant planet orbits may therefore constrain the
systems that can harbor potentially habitable, Earth-like planets. We present
results of 460 N-body simulations of terrestrial accretion from a disk of Moon-
to Mars-sized planetary embryos. We systematically vary the orbital semimajor
axis of a Jupiter-mass giant planet between 1.6 and 6 AU, and eccentricity
between 0 and 0.4. We find that for Sun-like stars, giant planets inside
roughly 2.5 AU inhibit the growth of 0.3 Earth-mass planets in the habitable
zone. If planets accrete water from volatile-rich embryos past 2-2.5 AU, then
water-rich habitable planets can only form in systems with giant planets beyond

accretion and water delivery. The majority of the current sample of extra-solar
giant planets appears unlikely to form habitable planets.",2006-05-04T20:04:19Z
"H-alpha Observations of a Large Sample of Galaxies at z~2: Implications
  for Star Formation in High Redshift Galaxies","Using H-alpha spectra of 114 rest-frame UV-selected galaxies at z~2, we
compare inferred star formation rates (SFRs) with those determined from the UV
continuum luminosity. After correcting for extinction using standard techniques
based on the UV continuum slope, we find excellent agreement between the
indicators, with <SFR_Ha> = 31 Msun/yr and <SFR_UV> = 29 Msun/yr. The agreement
between the indicators suggests that the UV luminosity is attenuated by an
typical factor of ~4.5 (with a range from no attenuation to a factor of ~100
for the most obscured object in the sample), in good agreement with estimates
of obscuration from X-ray, radio and mid-IR data. The H-alpha luminosity is
attenuated by a factor of ~1.7 on average, and the maximum H-alpha attenuation
is a factor of ~5. In agreement with X-ray and mid-IR studies, we find that the
SFR increases with increasing stellar mass and at brighter K magnitudes, to
<SFR_Ha> ~ 60 Msun/yr for galaxies with K<20; the correlation between K
magnitude and SFR is much stronger than the correlation between stellar mass
and SFR. All galaxies in the sample have SFRs per unit area Sigma_SFR in the
range observed in local starbursts. We compare the instantaneous SFRs and the
past average SFRs as inferred from the ages and stellar masses, finding that
for most of the sample, the current SFR is an adequate representation of the
past average. There is some evidence that the most massive galaxies (M_star
>10^11 Msun) have had higher SFRs in the past.",2006-04-18T20:47:21Z
Imaging the Dust Trail and Neckline of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko,"We report on the results of nearly 10 hours of integration of the dust trail
and neckline of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P henceforth) using the Wide
Field Imager at the ESO/MPG 2.2m telescope in La Silla. The data was obtained
in April 2004 when the comet was at a heliocentric distance of 4.7 AU outbound.
67P is the target of the Rosetta spacecraft of the European Space Agency.
Studying the trail and neckline can contribute to the quantification of
mm-sized dust grains released by the comet. We describe the data reduction and
derive lower limits for the surface brightness. In the processed image, the
angular separation of trail and neckline is resolved. We do not detect a coma
of small, recently emitted grains.",2006-03-27T13:00:59Z
Properties of Post-AGB stars,"A review is presented of the most relevant results obtained in the last few
years on this rare class of astronomical sources. Multi-wavelength analysis of
an increasing number of post-AGB stars reveal that they constitute a more
inhomogeneous population of stars than previously thought. The new data
available allow us to study these sources with unprecedent spatial resolution
and to extend our spectroscopic knowledge in a systematic way to the infrared
for the first time, where crucial information is contained on the chemical
composition of the gas and dust in their circumstellar shells. The overall
infrared properties derived from ISO and Spitzer data can be used to trace the
mass loss history and the chemical evolution of the ejected material. The new
results impose severe observational constraints to the current nucleosynthesis
models and suggest that the evolution is mainly determined not only by the
initial mass but also by the metallicity of the progenitor star. Post-AGB
samples are likely to grow in the near future with the advent of new data from
space facilities like Spitzer or Akari. Studies of post-AGB stars in the
galactic halo, the Magellanic Clouds and other galaxies of the Local Group will
certainly improve our knowledge on the evolutionary connections between AGB
stars and PNe.",2006-05-18T15:23:26Z
AD Mensae: a dwarf nova in the period gap,"AD Men was classified as a probable long-period dwarf nova based on its
long-term variability. Recent spectroscopic data instead suggested a
short-period system. With the here presented observations we aim at clarifying
its nature. Time--resolved photometry and spectroscopy has been used to get
information on the orbital period of this system. The light curve shows the
typical flickering and a clear hump--like periodic modulation with an average
amplitude of 0.3mag and a period of P=2.20(02)h. The radial velocity
measurements of the Halpha emission line confirm this value as the orbital
period. AD Men is thus located at the lower end of, but clearly inside, the gap
of the period distribution of cataclysmic variables, making it one of only 11
dwarf novae in this important period range.",2006-04-12T14:49:06Z
"FH Leonis, the first dwarf nova member of a multiple star system?","Sudden brightenings of HD 96273 or BD+07 2411B were observed with the
HIPPARCOS satellite in 1992,which still require a convincing explanation. A new
analysis of all known data of these two stars is given, including additional
information on the Balmer line equivalent widths. The brightenings can be
explained as SU UMa type dwarf nova outbursts, superimposed on the combined
light of two normal F and G type main sequence stars. Since the hypothetical
dwarf nova turns out to be located at the same distance as HD 96273 and BD+07
2411B, we possibly see here the first case of a cataclysmic variable as a
member of a multiple star system. Questions on history and evolution, as well
as possible ways to confirm this interpretation, are briefly outlined.",2006-03-27T16:00:44Z
"Spitzer/MIPS Limits on Asteroidal Dust in the Pulsar Planetary System
  PSR B1257+1","With the MIPS camera on Spitzer, we have searched for far-infrared emission
from dust in the planetary system orbiting pulsar PSR 1257+12. With accuracies
of 0.05 mJy at 24 um and 1.5 mJy at 70 um, photometric measurements find no
evidence for emission at these wavelengths. These observations place new upper
limits on the luminosity of dust with temperatures between 20 and 1000 K. They
are particularly sensitive to dust temperatures of 100-200 K, for which they
limit the dust luminosity to below $3 \times 10^{-5}$ of the pulsar's spin-down
luminosity, three orders of magnitude better than previous limits. Despite
these improved constraints on dust emission, an asteroid belt similar to the
Solar System's cannot be ruled out.",2006-04-05T22:08:54Z
A Spitzer Infrared Radius for the Transiting Extrasolar Planet HD209458b,"We have measured the infrared transit of the extrasolar planet HD209458b
using the Spitzer Space Telescope. We observed two primary eclipse events (one
partial and one complete transit) using the 24 micron array of the Multiband
Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS). We analyzed a total of 2392 individual
images (10-second integrations) of the planetary system, recorded before,
during, and after transit. We perform optimal photometry on the images and use
the local zodiacal light as a short-term flux reference. At this long
wavelength, the transit curve has a simple box-like shape, allowing robust
solutions for the stellar and planetary radii independent of stellar limb
darkening, which is negligible at 24 microns. We derive a stellar radius of
R$_*$ = 1.06 $\pm$ 0.07 R$_\sun$, a planetary radius of R$_p$ = 1.26 $\pm$ 0.08
R$_J$, and a stellar mass of 1.17 M$_\sun$. Within the errors, our results
agree with the measurements at visible wavelengths. The 24-micron radius of the
planet therefore does not differ significantly compared to the visible result.
We point out the potential for deriving extrasolar transiting planet radii to
high accuracy using transit photometry at slightly shorter IR wavelengths where
greater photometric precision is possible.",2006-06-05T20:43:56Z
Structures in the Great Attractor Region,"To further our understanding of the Great Attractor (GA), we have undertaken
a redshift survey using the 2dF on the AAT. Clusters and filaments in the GA
region were targeted with 25 separate pointings resulting in approximately 2600
new redshifts. Targets included poorly studied X-ray clusters from the CIZA
catalogue as well as the Cen-Crux and PKS 1343-601 clusters, both of which lie
close to the classic GA centre. For nine clusters in the region, we report
velocity distributions as well as virial and projected mass estimates. The
virial mass of CIZA J1324.7-5736, now identified as a separate structure from
the Cen-Crux cluster, is found to be ~3x10^14 M_sun, in good agreement with the
X-ray inferred mass. In the PKS 1343-601 field, five redshifts are measured of
which four are new. An analysis of redshifts from this survey, in combination
with those from the literature, reveals the dominant structure in the GA region
to be a large filament, which appears to extend from Abell S0639 (l=281\deg,
b=+11\deg) to (l~5\deg, b~-50\deg), encompassing the Cen-Crux, CIZA
J1324.7-5736, Norma and Pavo II clusters. Behind the Norma Cluster at cz~15000
km/s, the masses of four rich clusters are calculated. These clusters
(Triangulum-Australis, Ara, CIZA J1514.6-4558 and CIZA J1410.4-4246) may
contribute to a continued large-scale flow beyond the GA. The results of these
observations will be incorporated into a subsequent analysis of the GA flow.",2006-03-24T23:46:19Z
"The Nainital-Cape Survey -- II:Report for pulsation in five chemically
  peculiar A-type stars and presentation of 140 null results","To search photometric variability in chemically peculiar A type stars in the
northern hemisphere. High-speed photometric observations of Ap and Am star
candidates have been carried out from ARIES (Manora Peak, Nainital) using a
three-channel fast photometer attached to the ARIES 104-cm Sampurnanand
telescope. This paper presents three new variables: HD 113878, HD 118660 and HD
207561. During the time span of the survey (1999 December to 2004 January)
pulsations of the $\delta$ Sct type were also found for the two evolved Am
stars HD 102480 and HD 98851, as reported in Joshi et al. (2002, 2003).
Additionally, we present 140 null results of the survey for this time span. The
star HD 113878 pulsates with a period of 2.31 hr, which is typical of $\delta$
Sct stars. HD 118660 exhibits multi-periodic variability with a prominent
period of nearly 1 hr. These periods need to be investigated and make HD 118660
a particularly interesting target for further observations. For HD 207561, a
star classified as Am, a probable pulsation with a period of 6 min was found in
the light curves obtained on two consecutive nights. Both HD 102480 and HD
98851 exhibit unusual alternating high and low amplitude maxima, with a period
ratio of 2:1. The analysis of the null results confirms the photometric quality
of the Nainital",2006-05-18T07:32:01Z
"X-ray emission from the double neutron star binary B1534+12: Powered by
  the pulsar wind?","We report the detection of the double neutron star binary (DNSB) B1534+12 (=
J1537+1155) with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. This DNSB (orbital period 10.1
hr) consists of the millisecond (recycled) pulsar J1537+1155A (P_A=37.9 ms) and
a neutron star not detected in the radio. After the remarkable double pulsar
binary J0737-3039, it is the only other DNSB detected in X-rays. We measured
the flux of (2.2\pm 0.6)\times10^{-15} ergs s^{-1} cm^{-2} in the 0.3-6 keV
band. The small number of collected counts allows only crude estimates of
spectral parameters. The power-law fit yields the photon index of 3.2\pm 0.5
and the unabsorbed 0.2-10 keV luminosity L_X=6\times10^{29} ergs s^{-1} =
3\times 10^{-4}Edot_A, where Edot_A is the spin-down power of J1537+1155A.
Alternatively, the spectrum can be fitted by a blackbody model with T = 2.2 MK
and the projected emitting area of ~ 5\times 10^3 m^2. The distribution of
photon arrival times over binary orbital phase shows a deficit of X-ray
emission around apastron, which suggests that the emission is caused by
interaction of the relativistic wind from J1537+1155A with its neutron star
companion. We also reanalyzed the Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of
J0737-3039 and found that its X-ray spectrum is similar to the spectrum of
B1534+12, and its X-ray luminosity is about the same fraction of Edot_A, which
suggests similar X-ray emission mechanisms. However, the X-ray emission from
J0737-3039 does not show orbital phase dependence. This difference can be
explained by the smaller eccentricity of J0737-3039 or a smaller misalignment
between the equatorial plane of the millisecond pulsar and the orbital plane of
the binary.",2006-03-31T15:54:24Z
HD 65949: The Highest Known Mercury Excess Of Any CP Star?,"ESO spectra of HD 65949 show it to be unlike any of the well-known types
within its temperature range $\approx$ 13600K. It is neither a silicon, nor a
mercury-manganese star, though it has a huge Hg II line at $\lambda$3984. We
estimate $\log({\rm Hg/H}) + 12.0 \approx 7.4$. This is higher than any
published stellar mercury abundance. HD 65949 is a member of a nearby open
cluster, NGC 2516, which is only slightly older than the Pleiades, and has been
of recent interest because of its numerous X-ray emission stars, including HD
65949 itself, or a close companion. A longitudinal magnetic field of the order
of -290 Gauss at the 4.7~$\sigma$ level was very recently diagnosed from
accurate circular spectropolarimetric observations with FORS 1 at the VLT.
  The spectral lines are sharp, allowing a thorough identification study.
Second spectra of Ti, Cr, and Fe are rich. Mn II is well identified but not
unusually strong. Numerous lines of S II and P II are found, but not Ga II. The
resonance lines of Sr II are strong. While many Y II lines are identified, and
Nb II is very likely present, {\it no} Zr II lines were found. Xe II is well
identified. Strong absorptions from the third spectra of the lanthanides Pr,
Nd, and Ho are present, but lines from the second spectra of lanthanides are
extremely weak or absent. Among lines from the heavier elements, those of Pt II
are clearly present, and the heaviest isotope, $^{198}$Pt, is indicated. The
uncommon spectrum of Re II is certain, while Os II and Te II are highly
probable. Several of the noted anomalies are unusual for a star as hot as HD

"Can Experiments Studying Ultrahigh Energy Cosmic Rays Measure the
  Evolution of the Sources?","Interactions between cosmic ray protons and the photons of the cosmic
microwave background radiation, as well as the expansion of the universe, cause
cosmic rays to lose energy in a way that depends on the distance from the
cosmic nray source to the earth. Because of this, there is a correlation
between cosmic ray energies and the average redshift of their origin. This
correlation may be exploited to measure the evolution of the sources of cosmic
rays.
  Sky surveys of Quasi Stellar Objects (QSO's) and Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN's), made at optical and x-ray wavelengths, are consistent in showing that
the evolution of such objects exhibits a break at a redshift, z, of about 1.6.
At smaller redshifts, the luminosity density of QSO's and AGN's follows a
$(1+z)^m$ distribution, with $m \sim 2.6$, and exhibit a much flatter
distribution above the break. Measurements of the star formation rate are also
consistent with this picture.
  If QSO's and AGN's are sources of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays the break in
their evolution should appear in the cosmic ray spectrum at an energy of about
$10^{17.6}$ eV. This is the energy of the second knee.",2006-03-29T17:14:35Z
Reconstructing holographic quintessence,"The holographic dark energy model is an attempt for probing the nature of
dark energy within the framework of quantum gravity. The dimensionless
parameter $c$ determines the main property of the holographic dark energy. With
the choice of $c\geq 1$, the holographic dark energy can be described
completely by a quintessence scalar field. In this paper, we show this
quintessential description of the holographic dark energy with $c\geq 1$ and
reconstruct the potential of the quintessence as well as the dynamics of the
scalar field.",2006-04-23T07:40:39Z
"Effects of color superconductivity on the nucleation of quark matter in
  neutron stars","We study the nucleation of quark matter drops at the center of cold
deleptonized neutron stars. This is relevant in the determination of the
critical mass $M_{cr}$ of hadronic stars above which it is possible a
transition to a quark star (strange or hybrid). We investigate the dependence
of $M_{cr}$ upon the parameters of the quark model (the Bag constant $B$, the
pairing gap $\Delta$, and the surface tension $\sigma$ of the quark-hadron
interphase) and for different parametrization of the hadronic equations of
state. The dependence of $M_{cr}$ on $B$, $\Delta$ and $\sigma$ is mild if the
parameters of the quark model correspond to hybrid stars, and strong if they
correspond to strange stars. For a large part of the parameter space
corresponding to hybrid stars, the critical mass is very close (but smaller
than) the maximum mass of hadronic stars, and therefore compatible with a
""mixed"" population of compact stars (pure hadronic up to the critical mass and
hybrid above the critical mass). For very large $B$ the critical mass is never
smaller than the maximum mass of hadronic stars, implying that quark stars
cannot form through the here studied mechanism. The energy released in the
conversion is $3 \times 10^{52}$ erg - $4 \times 10^{53}$ erg, i.e. sufficient
to power a gamma ray burst.",2006-03-23T16:23:40Z
Dust Processing in Disks around T Tauri Stars,"The 8-14 micron emission spectra of 12 T Tauri stars in the Taurus/Auriga
dark clouds and in the TW Hydrae association obtained with the Infrared
Spectrograph (IRS; The IRS is a collaborative venture between Cornell
University and Ball Aerospace Corporation funded by NASA through the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory and the Ames Research Center.) on board Spitzer are
analyzed. Assuming the 10 micron features originate from silicate grains in the
optically thin surface layers of T Tauri disks, the 8-14 micron dust emissivity
for each object is derived from its Spitzer spectrum. The emissivities are fit
with the opacities of laboratory analogs of cosmic dust. The fits include small
nonspherical grains of amorphous silicates (pyroxene and olivine), crystalline
silicates (forsterite and pyroxene), and quartz, together with large fluffy
amorphous silicate grains. A wide range in the fraction of crystalline silicate
grains as well as large silicate grains among these stars are found. The dust
in the transitional-disk objects CoKu Tau/4, GM Aur, and DM Tau has the
simplest form of silicates, with almost no hint of crystalline components and
modest amounts of large grains. This indicates that the dust grains in these
objects have been modified little from their origin in the interstellar medium.
Other stars show various amounts of crystalline silicates, similar to the wide
dispersion of the degree of crystallinity reported for Herbig Ae/Be stars of
mass <2.5 solar masses. Late spectral type, low-mass stars can have significant
fractions of crystalline silicate grains. Higher quartz mass fractions often
accompany low amorphous olivine-to-amorphous pyroxene ratios. It is also found
that lower contrast of the 10 micron feature accompanies greater crystallinity.",2006-05-17T14:50:52Z
"The N2K Consortium VI: Doppler Shifts Without Templates and Three New
  Short-Period Planets","We present a modification to the iodine cell Doppler technique that
eliminates the need for an observed stellar template spectrum. For a given
target star, we iterate toward a synthetic template spectrum beginning with an
existing spectrum of a similar star. We then perturb the shape of this
first-guess template to match the program observation of the target star taken
through an iodine cell. The elimination of a separate template observation
saves valuable telescope time, a feature that is ideally suited for the
quick-look strategy employed by the ``Next 2000 Stars'' (N2K) planet search
program. Tests using Keck/HIRES spectra indicate that synthetic templates yield
a short-term precision of 3 m/s and a long-term, run-to-run precision of 5 m/s.
We used this new Doppler technique to discover three new planets: a 1.5 Mjup
planet in a 2.1375 d orbit around HD 86081; a 0.71 Mjup planet in circular,
26.73 d orbit around HD 224693; and a Saturn-mass planet in an 18.179 d orbit
around HD 33283. The remarkably short period of HD 86081b bridges the gap
between the extremely short-period planets detected in the OGLE survey and the
16 Doppler-detected hot jupiters (P < 15 d), which have an orbital period
distribution that piles up at about three days. We have acquired photometric
observations of two of the planetary host stars with the automated photometric
telescopes at Fairborn Observatory. HD 86081 and HD 224693 both lack detectable
brightness variability on their radial velocity periods, supporting
planetary-reflex motion as the cause of the radial velocity variability. HD
86081 shows no evidence of planetary transits in spite of a 17.6% transit
probability.",2006-04-17T03:54:28Z
Search for Lambda-Doubling Transitions of SiH in Orion KL,"A recent submillimeter line survey of Orion KL claimed detection of SiH. This
paper reports on GBT observations of the 5.7 GHz Lambda-doubling transitions of
SiH in Orion. Many recombination lines, including C164-delta, are seen, but SiH
is not detected. The nondetection corresponds to an upper limit of 1.5 x 10^15
cm^-2 (4 sigma) for the beam-averaged column density of SiH. This suggests that
the fractional abundance of SiH in the extended ridge is no more than twice
that in the hot core.",2006-06-20T20:44:49Z
"Near-Infrared and Optical Luminosity Functions from the 6dF Galaxy
  Survey","Luminosity functions and their integrated luminosity densities are presented
for the 6dF Galaxy Survey (6dFGS). This ongoing survey ultimately aims to
measure around 150,000 redshifts and 15,000 peculiar velocities over almost the
entire southern sky at |b|>10 deg. The main target samples are taken from the
2MASS Extended Source Catalog and the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey catalogue, and
comprise 138,226 galaxies complete to (K, H, J, rF, bJ) = (12.75, 13.00, 13.75,
15.60, 16.75). These samples are comparable in size to the optically-selected
Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey samples, and improve on
recent near-infrared-selected redshift surveys by more than an order of
magnitude in both number and sky coverage. The partial samples used in this
paper contain a little over half of the total sample in each band and are ~90
percent complete.
  Luminosity distributions are derived using the 1/Vmax, STY and SWML
estimators, and probe 1 to 2 absolute magnitudes fainter in the near-infrared
than previous surveys. The effects of magnitude errors, redshift incompleteness
and peculiar velocities have been taken into account and corrected throughout.
Generally, the 6dFGS luminosity functions are in excellent agreement with those
of similarly-sized surveys. Our data are of sufficient quality to demonstrate
that a Schechter function is not an ideal fit to the true luminosity
distribution, due to its inability to simultaneously match the faint end slope
and rapid bright end decline. Integrated luminosity densities from the 6dFGS
are consistent with an old stellar population and moderately declining star
formation rate.",2006-03-22T16:44:50Z
"Self-consistent theory of turbulent transport in the solar tachocline.
  II. Tachocline confinement","We provide a consistent theory of the tachocline confinement (or anisotropic
momentum transport) within an hydrodynamical turbulence model. The goal is to
explain helioseismological data, which show that the solar tachocline thickness
is at most 5% of the solar radius, despite the fact that, due to radiative
spreading, this transition layer should have thickened to a much more
significant value during the sun's evolution. Starting from the first principle
with the physically plausible assumption that turbulence is driven externally
(e.g. by plumes penetrating from the convection zone), we derive turbulent
(eddy) viscosity in the radial (vertical) and azimuthal (horizontal) directions
by incorporating the crucial effects of shearing due to radial and latitudinal
differential rotations in the tachocline. We show that the simultaneous
presence of both shears induces effectively a much more efficient momentum
transport in the horizontal plane than in the radial direction. In particular,
in the case of strong radial turbulence (driven by overshooting plumes from the
convection zone), the ratio of the radial to horizontal eddy viscosity is
proportional to ${\cal A}^{-1/3}$, where ${\cal A}$ is the strength of the
shear due to radial differential rotation. In comparison, in the case of
horizontally driven turbulence, this ratio becomes of order $-\epsilon^2$, with
negative radial eddy viscosity. Here, $\epsilon$ ($\ll 1$) is the ratio of the
radial to latitudinal shear. The resulting anisotropy in momentum transport
could thus be sufficiently strong to operate as a mechanism for the tachocline
confinement against spreading.",2006-05-04T12:27:32Z
"Tomography of the Reionization Epoch with Multifrequency CMB
  Observations","We study the constraints that future multifrequency Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) experiments will be able to set on the metal enrichment
history of the Inter Galactic Medium at the epoch of reionisation. We forecast
the signal to noise ratio for the detection of the signal introduced in the CMB
by resonant scattering off metals at the end of the Dark Ages. We take into
account systematics associated to inter-channel calibration, PSF reconstruction
errors and innacurate foreground removal. We develop an algorithm to optimally
extract the signal generated by metals during reionisation and to remove
accurately the contamination due to the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.
Although demanding levels of foreground characterisation and control of
systematics are required, they are very distinct from those encountered in
HI-21cm studies and CMB polarization, and this fact encourages the study of
resonant scattering off metals as an alternative way of conducting tomography
of the reionisation epoch. An ACT-like experiment with optimistic assumtions on
systematic effects, and looking at clean regions of the sky, can detect changes
of 3%-12% (95% c.l.) of the OIII abundance (with respect its solar value) in
the redshift range $z\in$ [12,22], for reionization redshift $z_{\rm re}>10$.
However, for $z_{\rm re} <10$, it can only set upper limits on NII abundance
increments of $\sim$ 60% its solar value in the redshift range $z\in$ [5.5,9],
(95% c.l.). These constraints assume that inter-channel calibration is accurate
down to one part in $10^{4}$, which constitutes the most critical technical
requirement of this method, but still achievable with current technology.",2006-04-14T05:07:51Z
Gauss-Bonnet braneworld and WMAP three year results,"We compare predictions for the spectral index and tensor-scalar ratio in
models of patch inflation with the WMAP three year data. There are three cases
of these models of inflation, which arise in the Gauss-Bonnet braneworld
scenario: Gauss-Bonnet (GB), Randall-Sundrum (RS), and 4D general relativity
(GR). We consider the large-field potential $V \propto \phi^p$ in both
commutative and noncommutative spacetimes, and find that in the cases of the GB
and GR patch cosmologies, the quadratic potential is observationally favored,
while the quartic potential is ruled out in most patches. Strong noncommutative
inflation is excluded in all cases because it leads to a blue-tilted scalar
spectral index.",2006-05-27T18:53:26Z
Gamma Ray Burst Constraints on Ultraviolet Lorentz Invariance Violation,"We present a unified general formalism for ultraviolet Lorentz invariance
violation (LV) testing through electromagnetic wave propagation, based on both
dispersion and rotation measure data. This allows for a direct comparison of
the efficacy of different data to constrain LV. As an example we study the
signature of LV on the rotation of the polarization plane of $\gamma$-rays from
gamma ray bursts in a LV model. Here $\gamma$-ray polarization data can provide
a strong constraint on LV, 13 orders of magnitude more restrictive than a
potential constraint from the rotation of the cosmic microwave background
polarization proposed by Gamboa, L\'{o}pez-Sarri\'{o}n, and Polychronakos
(2006).",2006-07-04T19:40:05Z
"Outer irregular satellites of the planets and their relationship with
  asteroids, comets and Kuiper Belt objects","Outer satellites of the planets have distant, eccentric orbits that can be
highly inclined or even retrograde relative to the equatorial planes of their
planets. These irregular orbits cannot have formed by circumplanetary accretion
and are likely products of early capture from heliocentric orbit. The irregular
satellites may be the only small bodies remaining which are still relatively
near their formation locations within the giant planet region. The study of the
irregular satellites provides a unique window on processes operating in the
young solar system and allows us to probe possible planet formation mechanisms
and the composition of the solar nebula between the rocky objects in the main
asteroid belt and the very volatile rich objects in the Kuiper Belt. The gas
and ice giant planets all appear to have very similar irregular satellite
systems irrespective of their mass or formation timescales and mechanisms.
Water ice has been detected on some of the outer satellites of Saturn and
Neptune whereas none has been observed on Jupiter's outer satellites.",2006-05-01T20:32:36Z

particular concentration in the Galactic Center (GC) region (~ 3 Msec in the
first year). Hence the most sensitive search regions are in the Galactic Plane
and Center. The phase space of the search spans the energy range 20-8000 keV
and line widths from 0-1000 keV (FWHM). It includes both diffuse and point-like
emission. We have searched for variable emission on time scales down to ~ 1000
sec. Diffuse emission has been searched for on a range of different spatial
scales from ~ 20 deg (the approximate field-of-view of the spectrometer) up to
the entire Galactic Plane. Our search procedures were verified by the recovery
of the known gamma-ray lines at 511 keV and 1809 keV at the appropriate
intensities and significances. We find no evidence for any previously unknown
gamma-ray lines. The upper limits range from a few x 10^-5 cm^-2 s^-1 to a few
x 10^-2 cm^-2 s^-1 depending on line width, energy and exposure; regions of
strong instrumental background lines were excluded from the search. Comparison
is made between our results and various prior predictions of astrophysical
lines.",2006-04-12T17:44:35Z
"Constraints on the mass of a habitable planet with water of nebular
  origin","From an astrobiological point of view, special attention has been paid to the
probability of habitable planets in extrasolar systems. The purpose of this
study is to constrain a possible range of the mass of a terrestrial planet that
can get water. We focus on the process of water production through oxidation of
the atmospheric hydrogen--the nebular gas having been attracted
gravitationally--by oxide available at the planetary surface. For the water
production to work well on a planet, a sufficient amount of hydrogen and enough
high temperature to melt the planetary surface are needed. We have simulated
the structure of the atmosphere that connects with the protoplanetary nebula
for wide ranges of heat flux, opacity, and density of the nebular gas. We have
found both requirements are fulfilled for an Earth-mass planet for wide ranges
of the parameters. We have also found the surface temperature of planets of <=
0.3 Earth masses is lower than the melting temperature of silicate (~ 1500K).
On the other hand, a planet of more than several Earth masses becomes a gas
giant planet through runaway accretion of the nebular gas.",2006-06-06T13:30:16Z
Remarks on Rapid vs. Slow Star Formation,"We discuss problems with some observational estimates indicating long
protostellar core lifetimes and large stellar age spreads in molecular clouds.
We also point out some additional observational constraints which suggest that
protostellar cores do not have long lifetimes before collapsing. For external
galaxies, we argue that the widths of spiral arms does not imply a long
star-formation process, since the formation of massive stars will disrupt
molecular clouds, move material around, compress it in other regions which
produce new star-forming clouds. Thus, it seems unavoidable that this cyclical
process will result in an extended period of enhanced star formation, which
does not represent the survival time of any individual molecular cloud. We
argue that the rapid star formation indicated observationally is also easier to
understand theoretically than the traditional scenario of slow quasi-static
contraction with ambipolar diffusion.",2006-05-10T17:59:58Z
"First stars IX -Mixing in extremely metal-poor giants. Variation of the
  12C/13C, [Na/Mg] and [Al/Mg] ratios","Extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars preserve a fossil record of the composition
of the ISM when the Galaxy formed. It is crucial, however, to verify whether
internal mixing has modified their surface. We aim to understand the CNO
abundance variations found in some, but not all EMP field giants analysed
earlier. Mixing beyond the first dredge-up of standard models is required, and
its origin needs clarification.The 12C/13C ratio is the most robust diagnostic
of deep mixing, because it is insensitive to the adopted stellar parameters and
should be uniformly high in near-primordial gas. We have measured 12C and 13C
abundances in 35 EMP giants from high-quality VLT/UVES spectra. Correlations
with other abundance data are used to study the depth of mixing.The 12C/13C
ratio is found to correlate with [C/Fe] (and Li/H), and clearly anti-correlate
with [N/Fe]. Evidence for such deep mixing is observed in giants above log
L/Lsolar = 2.6, brighter than in less metal-poor stars, but matching the bump
in the luminosity function in both cases. Three of the mixed stars are also
Na-and Al-rich, another signature of deep mixing, but signatures of the ON
cycle are not clearly seen in these stars. Extra mixing processes clearly occur
in luminous RGB stars. The Na-and Al-rich giants could be AGB stars themselves,
but an inhomogeneous early ISM or pollution from a binary companion remain
possible alternatives (abridged).",2006-05-02T15:59:07Z
2MASS J05162881+2607387: A New Low-Mass Double-Lined Eclipsing Binary,"We show that the star known as 2MASS J05162881+2607387 (hereafter J0516) is a
double-lined eclipsing binary with nearly identical low-mass components. The
spectroscopic elements derived from 18 spectra obtained with the High
Resolution Spectrograph on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope during the Fall of 2005
are K_1=88.45 +/- 0.48 km/s and K_2=90.43 +/- 0.60 km/s, resulting in a mass
ratio of$q=K_1/K_2 = 0.978 +/- 0.018 and minimum masses of M_1 sin^{3}i=0.775
+/- 0.016 solar masses and M_2 sin^{3}i=0.759 +/- 0.012 solar masses,
respectively. We have extensive differential photometry of J0516 obtained over
several nights between 2004 January-March (epoch 1) and 2004 October-2005
January plus 2006 January (epoch 2) using the 1m telescope at the Mount Laguna
Observatory. The source was roughly 0.1 mag brighter in all three bandpasses
during epoch 1 when compared to epoch 2. Also, phased light curves from epoch 1
show considerable out-of-eclipse variability, presumably due to bright spots on
one or both stars. In contrast, the phased light curves from epoch 2 show
little out-of-eclipse variability. The light curves from epoch 2 and the radial
velocity curves were analyzed using our ELC code with updated model atmospheres
for low-mass stars. We find the following: M_1=0.787 +/- 0.012 solar masses,
R_1=0.788 +/- 0.015 solar radii, M_2=0.770 +/- 0.009 solar masses, and
R_2=0.817 +/- 0.010 solar radii. The stars in J0516 have radii that are
significantly larger than model predictions for their masses, similar to what
is seen in a handful of other well-studied low-mass double-lined eclipsing
binaries. We compiled all recent mass and radius determinations from low-mass
binaries and determine an empirical mass-radius relation of the form R = 0.0324
+ 0.9343M + 0.0374M^2, where the quantities are in solar units.",2006-08-04T17:53:41Z
"Effects of cold dark matter decoupling and pair annihilation on
  cosmological perturbations","Weakly interacting massive particles are part of the lepton-photon plasma in
the early universe until kinetic decoupling, after which time the particles
behave like a collisionless gas with nonzero temperature. The Boltzmann
equation for WIMP-lepton collisions is reduced to a Fokker-Planck equation for
the evolution of the WIMP distribution including scalar density perturbations.
This equation and the Einstein and fluid equations for the plasma are solved
numerically including the acoustic oscillations of the plasma before and during
kinetic decoupling, the frictional damping occurring during kinetic decoupling,
and the free-streaming damping occurring afterwards and throughout the
radiation-dominated era. An excellent approximation reduces the solution to
quadratures for the cold dark matter density and velocity perturbations. The
subsequent evolution is followed through electron pair annihilation and the
radiation-matter transition; analytic solutions are provided for both large and
small scales. For a 100 GeV WIMP with bino-type interactions, kinetic
decoupling occurs at a temperature $T_d=23$ MeV. The transfer function in the
matter-dominated era leads to an abundance of small cold dark matter halos;
with a smooth window function the Press-Schechter mass distribution is $dn/d\ln
M\propto M^{-1/3}$ for $M<10^{-4} (T_d/$10 MeV)$^{-3}$ M$_\odot$.",2006-07-14T02:36:22Z
"Revisiting the characteristics of the spectral lags in short gamma-ray
  bursts","In this paper, we restudy the spectral lag features of short bright gamma-ray
bursts (T90 < 2.6s) with a BATSE time-tagged event (TTE) sample including 65
single pulse bursts. We also make an investigation on the characteristics of
ratios between the spectral lag and the full width at half maximum ($FWHM$) of
the pulses, called relative spectral lags (RSLs). We draw the conclusions as
follows: 1) Spectral lags of short GRBs are normally distributed and
concentrated on around the value of 0.014 with 40 percent of them having
negative lags. With K-S test, we find the lag distribution is identical with a
normal one caused by white noises, which indicates the lags of the vast
majority of short bursts are so small that they are negligible as Norris et al.
have suggested.",2006-04-17T11:25:55Z
Results from the GMT Ground-Layer Experiment at the Magellan Telescopes,"We present results from our two year study of ground-layer turbulence as seen
through the 6.5-meter Magellan Telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory. The
experiment consists of multiple, moderate resolution, Shack-Hartmann wavefront
sensors deployed over a large 16 arcminute field. Over the two years of the
experiment, the ground-layer turbulence has been sampled on eleven nights in a
variety of seeing and wind conditions. On most nights the ground-layer
turbulence contributes 10% to the total visible-band seeing, although a few
nights exhibit ground-layer contributions up to 30%. We present the
ground-layer turbulence on the sampled nights as well as a demonstration of its
strength as a function of field size. This information is combined with data
from a MASS-DIMM seeing monitor adjacent to the Magellan Telescopes to infer
the annual ground-layer contribution to seeing at Las Campanas.",2006-06-13T23:17:13Z
"Fluorine Abundance Variations as a Signature of Enhanced Extra Mixing in
  Red Giants of the Globular Cluster M4","We show that enhanced extra mixing in low-mass red giants can result in a
fluorine abundance that is correlated with abundance variations of other
elements participating in H burning, such as C, N, O and Na. This finding is
used to explain the fluorine abundance variations recently found in bright red
giants of the globular cluster M4.",2006-04-24T20:24:39Z
"The Black Hole in NGC 3379: A Comparison of Gas and Stellar Dynamical
  Mass Measurements with HST and Integral-Field Data","We combine Hubble Space Telescope spectroscopy and ground-based
integral-field data from the SAURON and OASIS instruments to study the central
black hole in the nearby elliptical galaxy NGC 3379. From these data, we obtain
kinematics of both the stars and the nuclear gaseous component. Axisymmetric
three-integral models of the stellar kinematics find a black hole of mass 1.4
(+2.6 / -1.0) x 10^8 M_sun (3 sigma errors). These models also probe the
velocity distribution in the immediate vicinity of the black hole and reveal a
nearly isotropic velocity distribution throughout the galaxy and down to the
black hole sphere of influence R_BH. The morphology of the nuclear gas disc
suggests that it is not in the equatorial plane; however the core of NGC 3379
is nearly spherical. Inclined thin-disc models of the gas find a nominal black
hole of mass 2.0 (+/- 0.1) x 10^8 M_sun (3 sigma errors), but the model is a
poor fit to the kinematics. The data are better fit by introducing a twist in
the gas kinematics (with the black hole mass assumed to be 2.0 x 10^8 M_sun),
although the constraints on the nature and shape of this perturbation are
insufficient for more detailed modelling. Given the apparent regularity of the
gas disc's appearance, the presence of such strong non-circular motion
indicates that caution must be used when measuring black hole masses with gas
dynamical methods alone.",2006-05-19T01:35:51Z
Cosmology with CMB anisotropy,"Measurements of CMB anisotropy and, more recently, polarization have played a
very important role allowing precise determination of various parameters of the
`standard' cosmological model. The expectation of the paradigm of inflation and
the generic prediction of the simplest realization of inflationary scenario in
the early universe have also been established -- `acausally' correlated initial
perturbations in a flat, statistically isotropic universe, adiabatic nature of
primordial density perturbations. Direct evidence for gravitational instability
mechanism for structure formation from primordial perturbations has been
established. In the next decade, future experiments promise to strengthen these
deductions and uncover the remaining crucial signature of inflation -- the
primordial gravitational wave background.",2006-07-12T12:12:58Z
"Comparison of the Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Ray Flux Observed by AGASA,
  HiRes and Auger","The current measurements of the cosmic ray energy spectrum at ultra-high
energies ($\text{E}>10^{19}$ eV) are characterized by large systematic errors
and poor statistics. In addition, the experimental results of the two
experiments with the largest published data sets, AGASA and HiRes, appear to be
inconsistent with each other, with AGASA seeing an unabated continuation of the
energy spectrum even at energies beyond the GZK cutoff energy at $10^{19.6}$
eV. Given the importance of the related astrophysical questions regarding the
unknown origin of these highly energetic particles, it is crucial that the
extent to which these measurements disagree be well understood. Here we
evaluate the consistency of the two measurements for the first time with a
model-independent method that accounts for the large statistical and systematic
errors of current measurements. We further compare the AGASA and HiRes spectra
with the recently presented Auger spectrum. The method directly compares two
measurements, bypassing the introduction of theoretical models for the shape of
the energy spectrum. The inconsistency between the observations is expressed in
terms of a Bayes Factor, a standard statistic defined as the ratio of a
separate parent source hypothesis to a single parent source hypothesis.
Application to the data shows that the two-parent hypothesis is disfavored. We
expand the method to allow comparisons between an experimental flux and that
predicted by any model.",2006-06-14T14:31:47Z
"UV and FIR selected star-forming galaxies at z=0: differences and
  overlaps","We study two samples of local galaxies, one is UV (GALEX) selected and the
other FIR (IRAS) selected, to address the question whether UV and FIR surveys
see the two sides ('bright' and 'dark') of the star formation of the same
population of galaxies or two different populations of star forming galaxies.
No significant difference between the L$_{tot}$ ($=L_{60}+L_{FUV}$) luminosity
functions of the UV and FIR samples is found. Also, after the correction for
the `Malmquist bias' (bias for flux limited samples), the FIR-to-UV ratio v.s.
L$_{tot}$ relations of the two samples are consistent with each other. In the
range of $9 \la \log(L_{tot}/L_\sun) \la 12$, both can be approximated by a
simple linear relation of $\log (L_{60}/L_{FUV})=\log(L_{tot}/L_\sun)-9.66$.
These are consistent with the hypothesis that the two samples represent the
same population of star forming galaxies, and their well documented differences
in L$_{tot}$ and in FIR-to-UV ratio are due only to the selection effect. A
comparison between the UV luminosity functions shows marginal evidence for a
population of faint UV galaxies missing in the FIR selected sample. The
contribution from these 'FIR-quiet' galaxies to the overall UV population is
insignificant, given that the K-band luminosity functions (i.e. the stellar
mass functions) of the two samples do not show any significant difference.",2006-04-04T12:41:53Z
The nature of (sub)-mm galaxies in hierarchical models,"We present a hierarchical galaxy formation model which can account for the
number counts of sources detected through their emission at sub-millimetre
wavelengths. The first stage in our approach is an ab initio calculation of the
star formation histories for a representative sample of galaxies, which is
carried out using the semi-analytical galaxy formation model GALFORM. These
star formation histories are then input into the spectro-photometric code
GRASIL, to produce a spectral energy distribution for each galaxy. Dust
extinction and emission are treated self consistently in our model, without
having to resort to ad-hoc assumptions about the amount of attenuation by dust
or the temperature at which the dust radiates. We argue that it is necessary to
modify the form of the stellar initial mass function in starbursts in order to
match the observed number of sub-mm sources, if we are to retain the previous
good matches enjoyed between observations and model predictions in the local
universe. We also list some other observational tests that have been passed by
our model.",2006-03-24T18:09:52Z
"Formation and Evolution of Planetary Systems: Upper Limits to the Gas
  Mass in Disks Around Sun-like Stars","We have carried out a sensitive search for gas emission lines at infrared and
millimeter wavelengths for a sample of 15 young sun-like stars selected from
our dust disk survey with the Spitzer Space Telescope. We have used
mid-infrared lines to trace the warm (300-100 K) gas in the inner disk and
millimeter transitions of 12CO to probe the cold (~20 K) outer disk. We report
no gas line detections from our sample. Line flux upper limits are first
converted to warm and cold gas mass limits using simple approximations allowing
a direct comparison with values from the literature. We also present results
from more sophisticated models following Gorti and Hollenbach (2004) which
confirm and extend our simple analysis. These models show that the SI line at
25.23 micron can set constraining limits on the gas surface density at the disk
inner radius and traces disk regions up to a few AU. We find that none of the
15 systems have more than 0.04 MJ of gas within a few AU from the disk inner
radius for disk radii from 1 AU up to ~40 AU. These gas mass upper limits even
in the 8 systems younger than ~30 Myr suggest that most of the gas is dispersed
early. The gas mass upper limits in the 10-40 AU region, that is mainly traced
by our CO data, are <2 Mearth. If these systems are analogs of the Solar
System, either they have already formed Uranus- and Neptune-like planets or
they will not form them beyond 100 Myr. Finally, the gas surface density upper
limits at 1 AU are smaller than 0.01% of the minimum mass solar nebula for most
of the sources. If terrestrial planets form frequently and their orbits are
circularized by gas, then circularization occurs early.",2006-06-27T22:28:17Z
"VLT/UVES Observations of Interstellar Molecules and Diffuse Bands in the
  Magellanic Clouds","We discuss the abundances of interstellar CH, CH+, and CN in the Magellanic
Clouds (MC), derived from spectra of 7 SMC and 13 LMC stars obtained (mostly)
with the VLT/UVES. CH and/or CH+ are detected toward 3 SMC and 9 LMC stars; CN
is detected toward 2 stars. In the MC, the CH/H2 ratio is comparable to that
found for diffuse Galactic molecular clouds in some sight lines, but is lower
by factors up to 10-15 in others. The abundance of CH in the MC thus appears to
depend on local physical conditions -- and not just on metallicity. The
observed relationships between the column density of CH and those of CN, CH+,
Na I, and K I in the MC are generally consistent with the trends observed in
our Galaxy. Using existing data for the rotational populations of H2, we
estimate temperatures, radiation field strengths, and local hydrogen densities
for the diffuse molecular gas. Densities estimated from N(CH), assuming that CH
is produced via steady-state gas-phase reactions, are considerably higher; much
better agreement is found by assuming that the CH is made via the (still
undetermined) process(es) responsible for the observed CH+. The UVES spectra
also reveal absorption from the diffuse interstellar bands at 5780, 5797, and
6284 A in the MC. On average, the three DIBs are weaker by factors of 7-9 (LMC)
and about 20 (SMC), compared to those observed in Galactic sight lines with
similar N(H I), and by factors of order 2-6, relative to E(B-V), N(Na I), and
N(K I). The detection of several of the ``C2 DIBs'', with strengths similar to
those in comparable Galactic sight lines, however, indicates that no single,
uniform scaling factor (e.g., one related to metallicity) applies to all DIBs
(or all sight lines) in the MC. (abstract abridged)",2006-03-14T00:25:04Z
"Meteoritical and dynamical constraints on the growth mechanisms and
  formation times of asteroids and Jupiter","Peak temperatures inside meteorite parent bodies are closely linked to
accretion times. Most iron meteorites come from bodies that accreted <0.5 Myr
after CAIs formed and were melted by 26Al and 60Fe, probably inside 2 AU.
Chondrite groups accreted intermittently over 4 Myr starting 1 Myr after CAIs
formed when planetary embryos may already have formed at ~1 AU. Meteorite
evidence precludes accretion of late-forming chondrites on the surface of
early-formed bodies; instead chondritic and non-chondritic meteorites probably
formed in separate planetesimals. Maximum metamorphic temperatures in chondrite
groups correlate inversely with mean chondrule age, as expected for 26Al
heating. Dynamical models suggest that asteroids accreted before Jupiter.
Therefore Jupiter probably reached its current mass >3-5 Myr after CAIs formed.
This precludes formation of Jupiter via a gravitational instability <1 Myr
after the solar nebula formed, and strongly favors core accretion. Shocks
formed by gravitational instabilities in the disk, proto-Jupiter, or by
planetary embryos may have produced some chondrules. The minimum lifetime for
the solar nebula of 3-5 Myr inferred from CAI and chondrule ages may exceed the
median 3 Myr lifetime for protoplanetary disks, but is well within the total
1-10 Myr range. Shorter formation times for extrasolar planets may help to
explain why their orbits are unlike those of solar giant planets.",2006-07-13T23:11:41Z
"A Catalog of Spectroscopically Confirmed White Dwarfs from the Sloan

the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4. We have selected the stars through
photometric cuts and spectroscopic modeling, backed up by a set of visual
inspections. Roughly 6000 of the stars are new discoveries, roughly doubling
the number of spectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs. We analyze the stars by
performing temperature and surface gravity fits to grids of pure hydrogen and
helium atmospheres. Among the rare outliers are a set of presumed helium-core
DA white dwarfs with estimated masses below 0.3 Msun, including two candidates
that may be the lowest masses yet found. We also present a list of 928 hot

"Extended inverse-Compton emission from distant, powerful radio galaxies","We present Chandra observations of two relatively high redshift FRII radio
galaxies, 3C 432 and 3C 191 (z=1.785 and z=1.956 respectively), both of which
show extended X-ray emission along the axis of the radio jet or lobe. This
X-ray emission is most likely to be due to inverse-Compton scattering of Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Under this assumption we estimate the
minimum energy contained in the particles responsible. This can be extrapolated
to determine a rough estimate of the total energy. We also present new, deep
radio observations of 3C 294, which confirm some association between radio and
X-ray emission along the NE-SW radio axis and also that radio emission is not
detected over the rest of the extent of the diffuse X-ray emission. This,
together with the offset between the peaks of the X-ray and radio emissions may
indicate that the jet axis in this source is precessing.",2006-06-09T16:52:29Z
Multi-Frequency VLBI Observations of NRAO 530,"We report on VLBA observations of a gamma-ray bright blazar NRAO 530 at
multiple frequencies (5, 8, 15, 22, 39, 43, and 45 GHz) in 1997 and 1999. These
multi-epoch multi-frequency high-resolution VLBI images exhibit a consistent
core-dominated morphology with a bending jet to the north of the core. The
quasi-simultaneous data observed at five frequencies (5, 8, 15, 22 and 43 GHz)
in February 1997 enable us to estimate the spectra of compact VLBI components
in this highly variable source. Flat spectra are seen in central two components

the south end is identified as the core.",2006-05-23T00:40:53Z

Heliocentric Orbits (NEACHOs) have corroborated once more the existence of the
March maximum in their flux by raising its confidence level to 99.99%. In
addition, these experiments permitted us to identify several FEU-167-1-type PM
tubes, with a few times thicker inner Al coating, which appear to be capable to
detect, without any scintillator, the crossing of negatively charged daemons.

"Spitzer Space Telescope Infrared Imaging and Spectroscopy of the Crab
  Nebula","We present 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, 24, and 70 micron images of the Crab Nebula
obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope IRAC and MIPS cameras, Low- and
High-resolution Spitzer IRS spectra of selected positions within the nebula,
and a near-infrared ground-based image made in the light of [Fe II]1.644
micron. The 8.0 micron image, made with a bandpass that includes [Ar II]7.0
micron, resembles the general morphology of visible H-alpha and near-IR [Fe II]
line emission, while the 3.6 and 4.5 micron images are dominated by continuum
synchrotron emission. The 24 micron and 70 micron images show enhanced emission
that may be due to line emission or the presence of a small amount of warm dust
in the nebula on the order of less than 1% of a solar mass. The ratio of the
3.6 and 4.5 micron images reveals a spatial variation in the synchrotron power
law index ranging from approximately 0.3 to 0.8 across the nebula. Combining
this information with optical and X-ray synchrotron images, we derive a
broadband spectrum that reflects the superposition of the flatter spectrum jet
and torus with the steeper diffuse nebula, and suggestions of the expected
pileup of relativistic electrons just before the exponential cutoff in the
X-ray. The pulsar, and the associated equatorial toroid and polar jet
structures seen in Chandra and HST images (Hester et al. 2002) can be
identified in all of the IRAC images. We present the IR photometry of the
pulsar. The forbidden lines identified in the high resolution IR spectra are
all double due to Doppler shifts from the front and back of the expanding
nebula and give an expansion velocity of approximately 1264 km/s.",2006-06-13T19:18:14Z
Numerical Studies of Diffusive Shock Acceleration at Spherical Shocks,"We have developed a cosmic ray (CR) shock code in one dimensional spherical
geometry with which the particle distribution, the gas flow and their nonlinear
interaction can be followed numerically in a frame comoving with an expanding
shock. In order to accommodate a very wide dynamic range of diffusion length
scales in the CR shock problem, we have incorporated subzone shock tracking and
adaptive mesh refinement techniques. We find the spatial grid resolution
required for numerical convergence is less stringent in this code compared to
typical, fixed-grid Eulerian codes. The improved convergence behavior derives
from maintaining the shock discontinuity inside the same grid zone in the
comoving code. That feature improves numerical estimates of the compression
rate experienced by CRs crossing the subshock compared to codes that allow the
subshock to drift on the grid. Using this code with a Bohm-like diffusion model
we have calculated the CR acceleration and the nonlinear feedback at supernova
remnant shocks during the Sedov-Taylor stage. Similarly to plane-parallel
shocks, with an adopted thermal leakage injection model, about 10^{-3} of the
particles that pass through the shock and up to 60 % of the explosion energy
are transferred to the CR component. These results are in good agreement with
previous nonlinear spherical CR shock calculations of Berezhko and
collaborators.",2006-03-09T06:25:44Z
Supernova Fallback: A Possible Site for the r-Process,"The conditions for the leading r-process site candidate, neutrino-driven
winds, can not be reproduced self-consistently in current supernova models. For
that reason, we investigate an alternate model involving the mass ejected by
fallback in a supernova explosion, through hydrodynamic and nucleosynthesis
calculations. The nucleosynthetic products of this ejected material produces
r-process elements, including those in the vicinity of the elusive 3rd peak at
mass number 195. Trans-iron element production beyond the second peak is made
possible by a rapid (<1ms) freezeout of alpha particles which leaves behind a
large nucleon (including protons!) to r-process seed ratio. This rapid phase is
followed by a relatively long (>15 ms) simmering phase at ~2e9 K, which is the
thermodynamic consequence of the hydrodynamic trajectory of the turbulent flows
in the fallback outburst. During the slow phase high mass elements beyond the
second peak are first made through rapid capture of both protons and neutrons.
The flow stays close to valley of stability during this phase. After freeze-out
of protons the remaining neutrons cause a shift out to short-lived isotopes as
is typical for the r-process. A low electron fraction isn't required in this
model, however, the detailed final distribution is sensitive to the electron
fraction. Our simulations suggest that supernova fallback is a viable
alternative scenario for the r-process.",2006-06-19T14:43:50Z
"An updated survey of globular clusters in M 31. I. Classification and
  radial velocity for 76 candidate clusters","Aims - We present the first results of a large spectroscopic survey of
globular clusters and candidate globular clusters in the nearby M~31 galaxy.
The survey is aimed at the classification of known candidate M~31 clusters and
at the study of their kinematic properties. Methods - We obtained
low-resolution spectroscopy (lambda/Dlambda~800-1300) for 133 targets,
including 76 yet-to-confirm candidate clusters (i.e. with no previous
spectroscopic information), 55 already-confirmed genuine M31 clusters, and 2
uncertain candidates. Our observations allowed a reliable estimate of the
target radial velocity, within a typical accuracy of ~+-20km/s. The observed
candidates have been robustly classified according to their radial velocity and
shape parameters that allowed us to confidently discriminate between point
sources and extended objects even from low-spatial-resolution imagery. Results
- In our set of 76 candidates clusters we found: 42 newly-confirmed bona-fide
M~31 clusters, 12 background galaxies, 17 foreground Galactic stars, 2 HII
regions belonging to M31 and 3 unclassified (possibly M31 clusters or
foreground stars) objects. The classification of a few other candidates not
included in our survey has been also reassessed on various observational bases.
All the sources of radial velocity estimates for M31 known globular clusters
available in the literature have been compared and checked, and a homogeneous
general list has been obtained for 349 confirmed clusters with radial velocity.
Conclusions - Our results suggest that a significant number of genuine clusters
(~> 100) is still hidden among the plethora of known candidates proposed by
various authors. Hence our knowledge of the globular cluster system of the M31
galaxy is still far from complete even in terms of simple membership.",2006-05-30T14:34:19Z
"alpha-element enhanced opacity tables and low-mass metal-rich stellar
  models","We investigate the influence of both a new generation of low-temperature
opacities and of various amounts of alpha-element enhancements on stellar
evolution models. New stellar models with two different alpha-element mixtures
and two sets of appropriate opacity tables are computed and compared. The
influence of the different mixtures as well as that of the improved generation
of opacity tables is investigated. It is found that around solar metallicity
the new opacity tables have a drastic influence on stellar temperatures, which
is mainly an effect of the new low-temperature tables, and not of variations in
alpha-element enhancement factors. The latter, however, influence stellar
lifetimes via systematic opacity effects at core temperatures. We trace the
reason for the low-temperature table changes to errors in the old tables. We
conclude that variations in alpha-element abundance ratios affect the
main-sequence properties of super-solar metallicity stars significantly. Red
giant branch effective temperatures depend only slightly on the specific
mixture. Our older low-temperature opacity tables were shown to be erroneous
and should no longer be used for stellar models with near- or super-solar
metallicity. Corrected tables have already been produced.",2006-05-26T14:14:28Z
Very Energetic Gamma-Rays from Microquasars and Binary Pulsars,"Compact astrophysical objects produce some of the highest energy light in the

Strong magnetic field in W75N OH maser flare,"A flare of OH maser emission was discovered in W75N in 2000. Its location was
determined with the VLBA to be within 110 au from one of the ultracompact H II
regions, VLA2. The flare consisted of several maser spots. Four of the spots
were found to form Zeeman pairs, all of them with a magnetic field strength of
about 40 mG. This is the highest ever magnetic field strength found in OH
masers, an order of magnitude higher than in typical OH masers. Three possible
sources for the enhanced magnetic field are discussed: (i) the magnetic field
of the exciting star dragged out by the stellar wind; (ii) the general
interstellar field in the gas compressed by the MHD shock; and (iii) the
magnetic field of planets which orbit the exciting star and produce maser
emission in gaseous envelopes.",2006-05-31T16:13:33Z
"A Spitzer/IRAC Search for Substellar Companions of the Debris Disk Star
  epsilon Eridani","We have used the InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) onboard the Spitzer Space
telescope to search for low mass companions of the nearby debris disk star
epsilon Eridani. The star was observed in two epochs 39 days apart, with
different focal plane rotation to allow the subtraction of the instrumental
Point Spread Function, achieving a maximum sensitivity of 0.01 MJy/sr at 3.6
and 4.5 um, and 0.05 MJy/sr at 5.8 and 8.0 um. This sensitivity is not
sufficient to directly detect scattered or thermal radiation from the epsilon
Eridani debris disk. It is however sufficient to allow the detection of Jovian
planets with mass as low as 1 MJ in the IRAC 4.5 um band. In this band, we
detected over 460 sources within the 5.70 arcmin field of view of our images.
To test if any of these sources could be a low mass companion to epsilon
Eridani, we have compared their colors and magnitudes with models and
photometry of low mass objects. Of the sources detected in at least two IRAC
bands, none fall into the range of mid-IR color and luminosity expected for
cool, 1 Gyr substellar and planetary mass companions of epsilon Eridani, as
determined by both models and observations of field M, L and T dwarf. We
identify three new sources which have detections at 4.5 um only, the lower
limit placed on their [3.6]-[4.5] color consistent with models of planetary
mass objects. Their nature cannot be established with the currently available
data and a new observation at a later epoch will be needed to measure their
proper motion, in order to determine if they are physically associated to
epsilon Eridani.",2006-05-06T23:54:31Z
"Deep shower interpretation of the cosmic ray events observed in excess
  of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin energy","We consider the possibility that the ultra-high-energy cosmic ray flux has a
small component of exotic particles which create showers much deeper in the
atmosphere than ordinary hadronic primaries. It is shown that applying the
conventional AGASA/HiRes/Auger data analysis procedures to such exotic events
results in large systematic biases in the energy spectrum measurement. SubGZK
exotic showers may be mis-reconstructed with much higher energies and mimick
superGZK events. Alternatively, superGZK exotic showers may elude detection by
conventional fluorescence analysis techniques.",2006-06-30T17:27:11Z
"Neutrino-Dominated Accretion Models for Gamma-Ray Bursts: Effects of
  General Relativity and Neutrino Opacity","We first refine the fixed concept in the literature that the usage of the
Newtonian potential in studies of black hole accretion is invalid and the
general relativistic effect must be considered. As our main results, we then
show that the energy released by neutrino annihilation in neutrino-dominated
accretion flows is sufficient for gamma-ray bursts when the contribution from
the optically thick region of the flow is included, and that in the optically
thick region advection does not necessarily dominate over neutrino cooling
because the advection factor is relevant to the geometrical depth rather than
the optical depth of the flow.",2006-04-18T04:46:48Z
"ELSA: An Integrated, Semi-Automated Nebular Abundance Package","We present ELSA, a new modular software package, written in C, to analyze and
manage spectroscopic data from emission-line objects. In addition to
calculating plasma diagnostics and abundances from nebular emission lines, the
software provides a number of convenient features including the ability to
ingest logs produced by IRAF's splot task, to semi-automatically merge spectra
in different wavelength ranges, and to automatically generate various data
tables in machine-readable or LaTeX format. ELSA features a highly
sophisticated interstellar reddening correction scheme that takes into account
temperature and density effects as well as He II contamination of the hydrogen
Balmer lines. Abundance calculations are performed using a 5-level atom
approximation with recent atomic data, based on R. Henry's ABUN program.
Improvements planned in the near future include use of a three-region
ionization model, similar to IRAF's nebular package, error propagation, and the
addition of ultraviolet and infrared line analysis capability. Detailed
documentation for all aspects of ELSA are available at

"Statistical analysis of BATSE gamma-ray bursts: Self-similarity and the
  Amati-relation","The statistical properties of a complete, flux limited sample of 197 long
gamma--ray bursts (GRBs) detected by BATSE are studied. In order to bring forth
their main characteristics, care was taken to define a representative set of
ten parameters. A multivariate analysis gives that ~70% of the total variation
in parameter values is driven by only three principal components. The variation
of the temporal parameters is clearly distinct from that of the spectral ones.
A close correlation is found between the half-width of the autocorrelation
function (tau) and the emission time (Tem); most importantly, this correlation
is self-similar in the sense that the mean values and dispersions of both tau
and Tem scale with the duration of the burst (T90). It is shown that the
Amati-relation can be derived from the sample and that the scatter around this
relation is correlated with the value of tau. Hence, tau has a role similar to
that of the break in the afterglow light curve (Tb) in the Ghirlanda-relation.
In the standard GRB-scenario, the close relation between a global parameter
(Tb) and a local one (tau) indicates that some of the jet-properties do not
vary much for different lines of sight. Finally, it is argued that the basic
temporal and spectral properties are associated with individual pulses, while
the overall properties of a burst is determined mainly by the number of pulses.",2006-06-20T15:31:00Z
"The Blue Straggler Population of the Globular Cluster M5: Comparison
  with M3","We have surveyed the blue straggler star population of the Galactic globular
cluster M5 using high-resolution images of the core along with wide-field
ground-based images reaching to more than 19 core radii. To gauge M5's relative
efficiency of producing stragglers, we compared our sample to five studies of
other globular clusters (mainly Ferraro et al. 1997b; Ferraro et al 2003; and
Piotto et al. 2004). Using a ""bright"" sample selected in the same way as
Ferraro et al. 1997b, we found a bimodal radial distribution similar to those
found in three other luminous clusters. When the radial distributions for
different clusters are scaled using the core radius, there is good
cluster-to-cluster agreement in the size of the core straggler sample and the
center of the ""zone of avoidance"". However, M5 has the smallest fraction of
stragglers in the zone of avoidance of any of the clusters measured to date,
and its zone of avoidance appears to be wider (in r / r_c) than that of M3,
which has a very similar surface brightness profile. Both of these facts
indicate that M5's straggler population has dynamically evolved to a larger
extent than M3. Using an ultraviolet sample from Hubble Space Telescope
selected in the same way as Ferraro et al. 2003 and Ferraro et al. 2004, we
find that the frequency of blue stragglers in M5 is lower than all but two of
the clusters examined. We also identified seven bright blue stragglers that
were previously misidentified as HB stars by Sandquist et al. (2004). These
bright stragglers are most likely the result of stellar collisions involving
binary stars.",2006-05-02T00:18:54Z
"K-Band Observations of Boxy Bulges. I. Morphology and Surface Brightness
  Profiles","Kn-band images, unsharp-masked images, as well as major-axis and vertically-
summed surface brightness profiles are presented for 30 edge-on spiral
galaxies, most with a boxy or peanut-shaped (B/PS) bulge. Such galaxies have
more complex morphologies than galaxies of other bulge types, more often
showing (off-)centered X structures, secondary major-axis maxima and
spiral-like structures. Those features are also observed in N-body simulations
of barred discs and may trace the main bar orbit families. The surface
brightness profiles of galaxies with a B/PS bulge are also more complex, with
typically 3 or more clearly separated regions, including a flat intermediate
region (Freeman Type II profiles). Those radial breaks offer evidence for
bar-driven transfer of angular momentum and radial redistribution of material.
The profiles also suggest a rapid variation of the scaleheight of the disc
material, contrary to conventional wisdom but again as expected from vertical
resonances and instabilities in barred discs. The steep inner region of the
surface brightness profiles is often shorter than the isophotally thick part of
the galaxies, itself always shorter than the flat region of the profiles.
Contrary to the standard `bulge + disc' model, we thus propose that galaxies
with a B/PS bulge are composed of a thin concentrated disc (a disc-like bulge)
contained within a partially thick bar (the B/PS bulge) and a thin outer disc.
The inner disc likely formed secularly through bar-driven processes and is
responsible for the steep inner region of the surface brightness profiles,
while the bar is responsible for the flat region and the thick complex
morphological structures observed. Those components are strongly coupled
dynamically and are formed mostly of the same (disc) material. [Abridged]",2006-06-02T15:06:24Z
"Precision Measurements of Higher-Order Angular Galaxy Correlations Using
  11 Million SDSS Galaxies","We present estimates of the N-point galaxy area-averaged angular correlation
functions wN for N = 2,...,7 from the third data release of the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS). The sample was selected from galaxies with 18 < r < 21, and
is the largest ever used to study higher-order correlations. The measured wN
are used to calculate the projected, sN, and real space, SN, hierarchical
amplitudes. This produces highly-precise measurements over 0.2 to 10 h-1 Mpc,
which are consistent with Gaussian primordial density fluctuations. The
measurements suggest that higher-order galaxy bias is non-negligible, as
defining b1 = 1 yields c2 = -0.24 +/- 0.08. We report the first SDSS
measurement of marginally significant third-order bias, c3 = 0.98 +/- 0.89,
which suggests that bias terms may be significant to even higher order.
Previous measurements of c2 have yielded inconsistent results. Inconsistencies
would be expected if different data sets sample different galaxy types,
especially if different galaxy types exhibit different higher-order bias. We
find early-type galaxies exhibit significantly different behavior than
late-types at both small and large scales. At large scales (r > 1 h-1 Mpc), we
find the SN for late-type galaxies are lower than for early-types, implying a
significant difference between their higher-order bias. We find b1,early = 1.36
+/- 0.04, c2,early = 0.30 +/- 0.10, b1,late = 0.81 +/- 0.03, and c2,late =
-0.70 +/- 0.08. Our results are robust against the systematic effects of
reddening and seeing. The latter introduces minor structure in wN.",2006-05-31T19:53:31Z
Detecting dark matter in electromagnetic field penetration experiments,"Dark matter in the form of particles from a hidden mirror sector has recently
been proposed as an explanation for the DAMA annual modulation signal. Here one
assumes that there exists a small mixing between photons and mirror photons. We
show that dark matter with this property can also be detected in
electromagnetic field penetration experiments. Such experiments can be used to
measure the speed and direction of the dark matter halo wind, the local
density, the temperature, and the strength of the photon-mirror photon mixing
interaction. An additional result would be a significant improvement of the
upper limit on the photon mass.",2006-05-15T20:00:37Z
Lower Limit to the Scale of an Effective Theory of Gravitation,"We consider a linearized, effective quantum theory of gravitation in which
gravity weakens at energies higher than ~10^-3 eV in order to accommodate the
apparent smallness of the cosmological constant. Such a theory predicts
departures from the static Newtonian inverse-square force law on distances
below ~0.05 mm. However, we show that such a modification also leads to changes
in the long-range behavior of gravity and is inconsistent with observed
gravitational lenses.",2006-06-06T22:06:39Z
A survey for redshifted molecular and atomic absorption lines I,"We are currently undertaking a large survey for redshifted atomic and
molecular absorption ... only one clear and one tentative detection were
obtained: HI absorption at z = 0.097 in PKS 1555-140 and OH absorption at z
=0.126 in PKS 2300-189, respectively... In order to determine why no clear
molecular absorption was detected in any of the 13 sources searched, we
investigate the properties of the five redshifted systems currently known to
exhibit OH absorption. In four of these, molecules were first detected via
millimetre-wave transitions and the flat radio spectra indicate compact
background continuum sources, which may suggest a high degree of coverage of
the background source by the molecular clouds in the absorber. Furthermore, for
these systems we find a relationship between the molecular line strength and
red optical--near infrared (V-K) colours, thus supporting the notion that the
reddening of these sources is due to dust, which provides an environment
conducive to the formation of molecules. Upon comparison with the V-K colours
of our sample, this relationship suggests that, presuming the reddening occurs
at the host galaxy redshift at least in some of the targets, many of our
observations still fall short of the sensitivityrequired to detect OH
absorption, although a confirmation of the ``detection'' of OH in 2300-189
could contravene this.",2006-07-26T05:12:16Z
The Narrow Line Region of the Seyfert 2 galaxy Mrk 78. An infrared view,"We report near-infrared spectroscopic data for the Seyfert 2 galaxy Mrk 78,
taken with the LIRIS near-infrared camera/spectrometer at the William Herschel
Telescope (WHT). The long-slit spectra clearly show extended emission. The
resolution and depth of the near-infrared spectra allows the examination of its
morphology and ionization regions, and a direct comparison with similarly deep
visible spectra. The emission-line ratios obtained are used to derive the
extinction towards the nucleus. The detection of strong features such as [Fe
II], H$_{2}$, hydrogen recombination lines and the coronal [Si
VI]$\lambda$1.962 line is used to study the kinematics and excitation
mechanisms occurring in Mrk 78, revealing that despite of the strong radio-jet
interaction present in this object, photoionization from the active nucleus
dominates the narrow line region emission, while UV fluorescence is the source
of the H$_{2}$ emission. Lines with extended emission yield velocity
distributions with an amplitude of about 600 km/s, the consequence of an
eastern lobe moving away from us plus a western lobe with the opposite
contribution. We used the photoionization code CLOUDY to recreate a typical
narrow line region region, to derive the ionization parameter, and to compare
our spectral data with diagnostic diagrams.",2006-03-16T13:27:32Z
"A Likelihood Method for Measuring the Ultrahigh Energy Cosmic Ray
  Composition","Air fluorescence detectors traditionally determine the dominant chemical
composit ion of the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray flux by comparing the averaged
slant depth of the shower maximum, $X_{max}$, as a function of energy to the
slant depths expect ed for various hypothesized primaries. In this paper, we
present a method to make a direct measurement of the expected mean number of
protons and iron by comparing the shap es of the expected $X_{max}$
distributions to the distribution for data. The advantages of this method
includes the use of information of the full distribution and its ability to
calculate a flux for various cosmic ray compositi ons. The same method can be
expanded to marginalize uncertainties due to choice of spectra, hadronic models
and atmospheric parameters. We demonstrate the technique with independent
simulated data samples from a parent sample of protons and iron. We accurately
predict the number of protons and iron in the parent sample and show that the
uncertainties are meaningful.",2006-04-27T03:59:43Z
"The UV spectrum of HS1700+6416 I. Predicting the metal line content of
  the far UV spectrum","In preparation of a study of the HeII/HI ratio towards the bright QSO
HS1700+6416, we predict the metal line content of the far-UV spectral range by
modelling 18 metal absorption line systems with redshifts 0.2<z<2.6 identified
in the spectrum of this quasar. For that purpose, we investigate the spectral
energy distribution of the metagalactic ionizing radiation field. Simple
photoionization models based on 8 different shapes of the ionizing background
are tested for each system. The adopted energy distributions comprise the
Haardt & Madau (2001, HM) model of metagalactic UV background as well as
typical spectra of AGN and starburst galaxies. The models are evaluated and the
favoured one is estimated. We find that the majority of the considered systems
is best reproduced with a HM-like ionizing radiation, where the HeII break,
formally located at 4 Ryd, is shifted to lower energies (~3 Ryd), probably due
to the opacity of the higher HeII Lyman series lines. The remaining systems can
be reasonably described with models based on the unmodified HM background or
the spectra of AGN or starburst galaxies. This finding supports the idea that
the UV background is spatially variable due to both IGM opacity variations and
to local sources. In comparison to an unmodified HM background, the resulting
ionizing spectrum leads to carbon abundances lower by ~0.5 dex. Furthermore, if
the ionizing radiation field as determined from metal line systems was typical
for the IGM, the expected HeII/HI ratio would be 150 to 190.",2006-05-17T16:16:26Z
Chandra Observations of Red Sloan Digital Sky Survey Quasars,"We present short \chandra observations of twelve bright (i<18) z_em~1.5
quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey chosen to have significantly redder
optical colors than most quasars at the same redshift. Of the five quasars with
optical properties most consistent with dust reddening at the quasar redshift,
four show indirect evidence of moderate X-ray absorption (inferred N_H~10^22
cm^-2) with a dust-to-gas ratio <1% of the SMC value. The remaining seven
objects show no evidence for even moderate intrinsic X-ray absorption. Thus,
while optically red quasars are marginally more likely to show signatures of
X-ray absorption than optically selected quasars with normal colors,
dust-reddened type 1 AGN (as opposed to fully obscured type 2 AGN) are unlikely
to contribute significantly to the remaining unresolved hard X-ray background.
The red quasar population includes objects with intrinsically red continua as
well as objects with dust-reddened continua. Improved sample selection is thus
needed to increase our understanding of either subpopulation. To identify
dust-reddened quasars likely to exhibit X-ray absorption, some measure of
spectral curvature is preferable to simple cuts in observed or relative
broad-band colors.",2006-06-16T21:17:22Z
On the metallicity dependence of HMXBs,"It is commonly assumed that high mass X-ray binary (HMXB) populations are
little-affected by metallicity. However, the massive stars making up their
progenitor systems depend on metallicity in a number of ways, not least through
their winds. We present simulations, well-matched to the observed sample of
Galactic HMXBs, which demonstrate that both the number and the mean period of
HMXB progenitors can vary with metallicity, with the number increasing by about
a factor of three between solar and SMC metallicity. However, the SMC
population itself cannot be explained simply by metallicity effects; it
requires both that the HMXBs observed therein primarily sample the older end of
the HMXB population, and that the star formation rate at the time of their
formation was very large.",2006-06-08T16:55:18Z
TIRAVEL - Template Independent RAdial VELocity measurement,"We propose a new approach to measure differential radial velocities, mainly
for single-lined spectroscopic binaries. The proposed procedure - TIRAVEL
(Template Independent RAdial VELocities) - does not rely on a prior theoretical
or observed template, but instead looks for a set of relative Doppler shifts
that simultaneously optimizes the alignment of all the observed spectra. We
suggest a simple measure to quantify this overall alignment and use its maximum
to measure the relative radial velocities. As a demonstration, we apply TIRAVEL
to the observed spectra of three known spectroscopic binaries, and show that in
two cases TIRAVEL performs as good as the commonly used approach, while in one
case TIRAVEL yielded a better orbital solution.",2006-07-13T11:47:06Z
Galaxy Galaxy Lensing as a Probe of Galaxy Dark Matter Halos,"Gravitational lensing has now become a popular tool to measure the mass
distribution of structures in the Universe on various scales. Here we focus on
the study of galaxy's scale dark matter halos with galaxy-galaxy lensing
techniques: observing the shapes of distant background galaxies which have been
lensed by foreground galaxies allows us to map the mass distribution of the
foreground galaxies. The lensing effect is small compared to the intrinsic
ellipticity distribution of galaxies, thus a statistical approach is needed to
derive some constraints on an average lens population. An advantage of this
method is that it provides a probe of the gravitational potential of the halos
of galaxies out to very large radii, where few classical methods are viable,
since dynamical and hydrodynamical tracers of the potential cannot be found at
this radii. We will begin by reviewing the detections of galaxy-galaxy lensing
obtained so far. Next we will present a maximum likelihood analysis of
simulated data we performed to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of
constraints that can be obtained on galaxy halo properties. Then we will apply
this method to study the properties of galaxies which stand in massive cluster
lenses at z~0.2. The main result of this work is to find dark matter halos of
cluster galaxies to be significantly more compact compared to dark matter halos
around field galaxies of equivalent luminosity, in agreement with early
galaxy-galaxy lensing studies and with theoretical expectations, in particular
with the tidal stripping scenario. We thus provide a strong confirmation of
tidal truncation from a homogeneous sample of galaxy clusters. Moreover, it is
the first time that cluster galaxies are probed successfully using
galaxy-galaxy lensing techniques from ground based data.",2006-06-19T13:59:44Z
"Identifications of Four INTEGRAL Sources in the Galactic Plane via
  Chandra Localizations","Hard X-ray imaging of the Galactic plane by the INTEGRAL satellite is
uncovering large numbers of 20-100 keV ""IGR"" sources. We present results from
Chandra, INTEGRAL, optical, and IR observations of 4 IGR sources: 3 sources in
the Norma region of the Galaxy (IGR J16195-4945, IGR J16207-5129, and IGR
J16167-4957) and one that is closer to the Galactic center (IGR J17195-4100).
In all 4 cases, one relatively bright Chandra source is seen in the INTEGRAL
error circle, and these are likely to be the soft X-ray counterparts of the IGR
sources. They have hard 0.3-10 keV spectra with power-law photon indices of 0.5
to 1.1. While many previously studied IGR sources show high column densities,
only IGR J16195-4945 has a column density that could be as high as 10^23 cm^-2.
Using optical and IR sky survey catalogs and our own photometry, we have
obtained identifications for all 4 sources. The J-band magnitudes are in the
range 14.9-10.4, and we have used the optical/IR spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) to constrain the nature of the sources. Blackbody components with
temperature lower limits of >9400 K for IGR J16195-4945 and >18,000 K for IGR
J16207-5129 indicate that these are very likely High-Mass X-ray Binaries
(HMXBs). However, for IGR J16167-4957 and IGR J17195-4100, low extinction and
the SEDs indicate later spectral types for the putative companions, indicating
that these are not HMXBs.",2006-03-30T05:23:58Z
"The ATESP 5 GHz radio survey I. Source counts and spectral index
  properties of the faint radio population","[Abridged] The nature and evolutionary properties of the faint radio
population, responsible for the steepening observed in the 1.4 GHz source
counts below 1 milliJy, are not yet entirely clear. Radio spectral indices may
help to constrain the origin of the radio emission in such faint radio sources
and may be fundamental in understanding eventual links to the optical light. We
study the spectral index behaviour of sources that were found in the 1.4 GHz
ATESP survey (Prandoni et al. 2000a,b). Using the Australia Telescope Compact
Array we observed at 5 GHz part of the region covered by the sub-mJy ATESP
survey. In particular we imaged a one square degree area for which deep optical
imaging in UBVRIJK is available. In this paper we present the 5 GHz survey and
source catalogue, we derive the 5 GHz source counts and we discuss the 1.4-5
GHz spectral index properties of the ATESP sources. The analysis of the optical
properties of the sample will be the subject of a following paper. The 5 GHz
survey has produced a catalogue of 111 radio sources, complete down to a (6
sigma) limit S_lim(5 GHz)~0.4 mJy. We take advantage of the better spatial
resolution at 5 GHz (~2 arcsec compared to ~8 arcsec at 1.4 GHz) to infer radio
source structures and sizes. The 5 GHz source counts derived by the present
sample are consistent with those reported in the literature, but improve
significantly the statistics in the flux range 0.4< S(5 GHz)<1 mJy. The ATESP
sources show a flattening of the 1.4-5 GHz spectral index with decreasing flux
density, which is particularly significant for the 5 GHz selected sample. Such
a flattening confirm previous results coming from smaller samples and is
consistent with a flattening of the 5 GHz source counts occurring at fluxes
<=0.5 mJy.",2006-07-07T16:50:02Z
"GMASS, Unveiling Distant Massive Galaxies with Spitzer","One of the main questions of galaxy formation is how and when galaxies
assembled their mass. Observations suggest that most mass assembly and star
formation occured at 1 < z < 3. However, in the same redshift range, fully
assembled old and massive galaxies co-exist with star-bursting systems still in
their assembling stage. In order to explore galaxy evolution in this critical
redshift range, we started a project called GMASS (Galaxy Mass Assembly
ultra-deep Spectroscopic Survey) based on an 145 hours ESO Large Program and
aimed at doing ultradeep spectroscopy with the VLT of a sample of high redshift
galaxies slected with IRAC/Spitzer m(4.5mu) < 23, z(phot) > 1.4) from the
GOODS-South/HUDF region. The selection at 4.5 micron is crucial to select high
redshift galaxies based on the stellar mass or objects affected by strong dust
extinction. The spectroscopic deep integration times (15 - 50 hours) are needed
to identify unambiguously the redshift and nature of these galaxies, which
redshifts are mostly in the ""desert"" where spectroscopy is traditionally
difficult due to the absence of strong emission lines at optical wavelengths.
The survey is almost complete and some preliminary results are presented here.",2006-04-06T14:01:07Z
"An XMM-Newton view of the young open cluster NGC 6231 -- II. The OB star
  population","In this second paper, we pursue the analysis of the 180 ks XMM-Newton
campaign towards the young open cluster NGC 6231 and we focus on its rich OB
star population. We present a literature-based census of the OB stars in the
field of view with more than one hundred objects, among which 30% can be
associated with an X-ray source. All the O-type stars are detected in the X-ray
domain as soft and reasonably strong emitters. In the 0.5-10.0 keV band, their
X-ray luminosities scale with their bolometric luminosities as $\log
L_\mathrm{X} - \log L_\mathrm{bol}=-6.912\pm0.153$. Such a scaling law holds in
the soft (0.5-1.0 keV) and intermediate (1.0-2.5 keV) bands but breaks down in
the hard band. While the two colliding wind binaries in our sample clearly
deviate from this scheme, the remaining O-type objects show a very limited
dispersion (40% or 20% according to whether `cool' dwarfs are included or not),
much smaller than that obtained from previous studies. At our detection
threshold and within our sample, the sole identified mechanism that produces
significant modulations in the O star X-ray emission is related to wind
interaction. The intrinsic X-ray emission of non-peculiar O-type stars seems
thus constant for a given star and the level of its X-ray emission is
accurately related to the its luminosity or, equivalently, to its wind
properties. Among B-type stars, the detection rate is only about 25% in the
sub-type range B0-B4 and remains mostly uniform throughout the different
sub-populations while it drops significantly at later sub-types. The associated
X-ray spectra are harder than those of O-type stars. Our analysis points
towards the detected emission being associated with a physical PMS companion

"MUSYC: A Deep Square Degree Survey of the Formation and Evolution of
  Galaxies and Supermassive Black Holes","The Multiwavelength Survey by Yale-Chile (MUSYC) is optimized for the study
of galaxies at z=3, AGN demographics, and Galactic structure. MUSYC consists of
deep optical (UBVRIz') and near-infrared (JHK) imaging of four fields on the
sky covering 1.2 square degrees to AB limiting depths of U,B,V,R=26 and K=22.
Our optical catalog contains 277,341 objects detected in BVR images with median
seeing of 0.9''. Satellite coverage of our fields includes Chandra, XMM, GALEX,
HST-ACS, and Spitzer, with the Extended Chandra Deep Field South imaged at all
of these wavelengths plus the radio, making it the premier multiwavelength
field on the sky. Detailed follow-up spectroscopy is being performed with
VLT+VIMOS, Magellan+IMACS and Gemini+GNIRS. MUSYC provides ideal supporting
data for surveys with Z-Machines and rich target lists for spectroscopy with
ALMA. We are conducting a census of protogalaxies at redshift three (Lyman
break galaxies, Lyman-alpha emitters, Distant red galaxies, Sub-millimeter
galaxies and AGN) in order to separate physical properties from selection
effects. We discuss measurements of the dark matter halo masses and halo
occupation numbers of these populations and of the total cosmic star formation
rate at z=3. MUSYC publications and data releases are available at

Interstellar C2 Molecule as Seen in HST/STIS Data,"Carbon chains are sometimes considered as possible carriers of some diffuse
interstellar bands. Spectroscopic observations in UV band carried by
spectrometer STIS fed with HST, give us the possibility to detect many
interstellar molecules. We focused our attention on C2 molecule and we detected
it in spectra of three reddened stars (HD27778, HD147933, HD207198).
Interstellar molecule C2 was detected as a set of absorption lines around 2313
angstroms.",2006-07-10T14:58:05Z
Probing T Tauri Accretion and Outflow with 1 Micron Spectroscopy,"In a high dispersion 1 micron survey of 39 classical T Tauri stars veiling is
detected in 80%, and He I 10830 and Pgamma line emission in 97% of the stars.
On average, the 1 micron veiling exceeds the level expected from previously
identified sources of excess emission, suggesting the presence of an additional
contributor to accretion luminosity in the star-disk interface region.
Strengths of both lines correlate with veiling, and at Pgamma there is a
systematic progression in profile morphology with veiling. He I 10830 has an
unprecedented sensitivity to inner winds, showing blueshifted absorption below
the continuum in 71% of the CTTS compared to 0% at pgamma. This line is also
sensitive to magnetospheric accretion flows, with redshifted absorption below
the continuum found in 47% of the CTTS compared to 24% at Pgamma. The
blueshifted absorption at 10830 shows considerable diversity in its breadth and
penetration depth into the continuum, indicating that a range of inner wind
conditions exist in accreting stars. We interpret the broadest and deepest blue
absorptions as formed from scattering of the 1 micron continuum by outflowing
gas whose full acceleration region envelopes the star, suggesting radial
outflow from the star. In contrast, narrow blue absorption with a range of
radial velocities more likely arises via scattering of the 1 micron continuum
by a wind emerging from the inner disk. Both stellar and disk winds are
accretion powered since neither is seen in non-accreting WTTS and among the
CTTS helium strength correlates with veiling.",2006-04-01T14:49:17Z
"The OLS-lens survey: The discovery of five new galaxy-galaxy strong
  lenses from the SDSS","Bright galaxy-galaxy strong lenses are much more powerful than lensed quasars
for measuring the mass profiles of galaxies, but until this year only a handful
have been known. Here we present five new examples, identified via the optimal
line-of-sight gravitational lens search strategy applied to luminous red
galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Our survey largely complements
a similar survey by Bolton et al., who recently presented several new lenses.
The lensed background galaxies are selected from the SDSS spectra via the
presence of narrow emission line signatures, including the [OII] 3726,3729, Hb
and [OIII] 4960,5008 lines, superposed on the spectra of the bright,
intervening, deflector galaxies. Our five confirmed new systems include
deflector galaxies with redshifts z=0.17-0.28 and lensed galaxies with
redshifts z=0.47-1.18. Simulations of moderately deep (few orbits) HST-ACS
imaging of systems such as these, where the lensed source is brighter than
r~23, are presented. These demonstrate the feasibility of measuring accurately
the inner slope of the dark matter halo to within an uncertainty
sigma(gamma)~0.1, the dark matter fraction within the Einstein radius, and the
mass-to-light ratio of the stars alone, independently of dynamical
measurements. The high success rate of our search so far, >60%, and the
relatively modest observational resources necessary to confirm the
gravitational lens nature of the candidates, demonstrate that compilation of a
sample of ~100 galaxy-galaxy lenses from the SDSS is readily achievable,
opening up a rich new field in dark matter studies.",2006-03-16T13:41:26Z
Heating and cooling of the intergalactic medium by resonance photons,"During the epoch of reionization a large number of photons were produced with
frequencies below the hydrogen Lyman limit. After redshifting into the closest
resonance, these photons underwent multiple scatterings with atoms. We examine
the effect of these scatterings on the temperature of the neutral intergalactic
medium (IGM). Continuum photons, emitted between the Ly_alpha and Ly_gamma
frequencies, heat the gas after being redshifted into the H Ly_alpha or D
Ly_beta resonance. By contrast, photons emitted between the Ly_gamma and
Ly-limit frequencies, produce effective cooling of the gas. Prior to
reionization, the equilibrium temperature of ~100 K for hydrogen and helium
atoms is set by these two competing processes. At the same time, Ly_beta
resonance photons thermally decouple deuterium from other species, raising its
temperature as high as 10^4 K. Our results have important consequences for the
cosmic 21-cm background and the entropy floor of the early IGM which can affect
star formation and reionization.",2006-04-22T18:37:17Z
Quintom models with an equation of state crossing -1,"In this paper, we investigate a kind of special quintom model, which is made
of a quintessence field $\phi_1$ and a phantom field $\phi_2$, and the
potential function has the form of $V(\phi_1^2-\phi_2^2)$. This kind of quintom
fields can be separated into two kinds: the hessence model, which has the state
of $\phi_1^2>\phi_2^2$, and the hantom model with the state
$\phi_1^2<\phi_2^2$. We discuss the evolution of these models in the
$\omega$-$\omega'$plane ($\omega$ is the state equation of the dark energy, and
$\omega'$ is its time derivative in unites of Hubble time), and find that
according to $\omega>-1$ or $<-1$, and the potential of the quintom being
climbed up or rolled down, the $\omega$-$\omega'$ plane can be divided into
four parts. The late time attractor solution, if existing, is always
quintessence-like or $\Lambda$-like for hessence field, so the Big Rip doesn't
exist. But for hantom field, its late time attractor solution can be
phantom-like or $\Lambda$-like, and sometimes, the Big Rip is unavoidable. Then
we consider two special cases: one is the hessence field with an exponential
potential, and the other is with a power law potential. We investigate their
evolution in the $\omega$-$\omega'$ plane. We also develop a theoretical method
of constructing the hessence potential function directly from the effective
equation of state function $\omega(z)$. We apply our method to five kinds of
parametrizations of equation of state parameter, where $\omega$ crossing -1 can
exist, and find they all can be realized. At last, we discuss the evolution of
the perturbations of the quintom field, and find the perturbations of the
quintom $\delta_Q$ and the metric $\Phi$ are all finite even if at the state of
$\omega=-1$ and $\omega'\neq0$.",2006-04-21T06:34:30Z
Non-Gaussianity of the primordial perturbation in the curvaton model,"We use the delta N -formalism to investigate the non-Gaussianity of the
primordial curvature perturbation in the curvaton scenario for the origin of
structure. We numerically calculate the full probability distribution function
allowing for the non-instantaneous decay of the curvaton and compare this with
analytic results derived in the sudden-decay approximation. We also present
results for the leading-order contribution to the primordial bispectrum and
trispectrum. In the sudden-decay approximation we derive a fully non-linear
expression relating the primordial perturbation to the initial curvaton
perturbation. As an example of how non-Gaussianity provides additional
constraints on model parameters, we show how the primordial bispectrum on CMB
scales can be used to constrain variance on much smaller scales in the curvaton
field. Our analytical and numerical results allow for multiple tests of
primordial non-Gaussianity, and thus they can offer consistency tests of the
curvaton scenario.",2006-07-27T19:39:28Z
"2D and 3D MHD Simulations of Disk Accretion by Rotating Magnetized
  Stars: Search for Variability","We performed 2D and full 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of disk accretion
to a rotating star with an aligned or misaligned dipole magnetic field. We
investigated the rotational equilibrium state and derived from simulations the
ratio between two main frequencies: the spin frequency of the star and the
orbital frequency at the inner radius of the disk. In 3D simulations we
observed different features related to the non-axisymmetry of the
magnetospheric flow. These features may be responsible for high-frequency
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). Variability at much lower frequencies may
be connected with restructuring of the magnetic flux threading the inner
regions of the disk. Such variability is specifically strong at the propeller
stage of evolution.",2006-04-05T22:30:23Z
The magnetic nature of disk accretion onto black holes,"Although disk accretion onto compact objects - white dwarfs, neutron stars,
and black holes - is central to much of high energy astrophysics, the
mechanisms which enable this process have remained observationally elusive.
Accretion disks must transfer angular momentum for matter to travel radially
inward onto the compact object. Internal viscosity from magnetic processes and
disk winds can in principle both transfer angular momentum, but hitherto we
lacked evidence that either occurs. Here we report that an X-ray-absorbing wind
discovered in an observation of the stellar-mass black hole binary GRO J1655-40
must be powered by a magnetic process that can also drive accretion through the
disk. Detailed spectral analysis and modeling of the wind shows that it can
only be powered by pressure generated by magnetic viscosity internal to the
disk or magnetocentrifugal forces. This result demonstrates that disk accretion
onto black holes is a fundamentally magnetic process.",2006-05-16T14:36:09Z
"Galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field: I. Detection, Multiband
  Photometry, Photometric Redshifts, and Morphology","We present aperture-matched PSF-corrected BVi'z'JH photometry and Bayesian
photometric redshifts (BPZ) for objects detected in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field
(UDF), 8,042 of which are detected at the 10-sigma level (e.g., i'<29.01 or
z'<28.43). Most of our objects are defined identically to those in the public
STScI catalogs, enabling straightforward object-by-object comparison. We have
combined detections from i', z', J+H, and B+V+i'+z' images into a single
comprehensive segmentation map. Using a new program called SExSeg we are able
to force this segmentation map into SExtractor for photometric analysis. The
resulting photometry is corrected for the wider NIC3 PSFs using our ColorPro
software. We also correct for the ACS z'-band PSF halo. The NIC3 magnitudes are
found to be too faint relative to the ACS fluxes. Based on BPZ SED fits to
objects of know spectroscopic redshift, we derived corrections of -0.30 +/-
0.03 mag in J and -0.18 +/- 0.04 mag in H. The offsets appear to be supported
by a recent recalibration of the UDF NIC3 images combined with non-linearity
measured in NICMOS itself. The UDF reveals a large population of faint blue
galaxies (presumably young starbursts), bluer than those observed in the
original Hubble Deep Fields (HDF). To accommodate these galaxies, we have added
two new starburst templates to the SED library used in previous BPZ papers. The
resulting photometric redshifts are accurate to within 0.04 * 1+z_spec out to z
< 6. Finally, we measure galaxy morphology, including Sersic index and
asymmetry. Our full catalog, software packages, and more are available at

Dielectronic recombination of Fe^{13+}: benchmarking the M-shell,"We have carried-out a series of multi-configuration Breit-Pauli AUTOSTRUCTURE
calculations for the dielectronic recombination of Fe^{13+}. We present a
detailed comparison of the results with the high-energy resolution measurements
reported recently from the Heidelberg Test Storage Ring by Schmidt et al. Many
Rydberg series contribute significantly from this initial 3s^2 3p M-shell ion,
resulting in a complex recombination `spectrum'. While there is much close
agreement between theory and experiment, differences of typically 50% in the
summed resonance strengths over 0.1-10 eV result in the experimentally based
total Maxwellian recombination rate coefficient being a factor of 1.52-1.38
larger than theory over 10^4-10^5 K, which is a typical temperature range of
peak abundance for Fe^{13+} in a photoionized plasma. Nevertheless, this
theoretical recombination rate coefficient is an order of magnitude larger than
that used by modellers to-date. This may help explain the discrepancy between
the iron M-shell ionization balance predicted by photoionization modelling
codes such as ION and CLOUDY and that deduced from the iron M-shell
unresolved-transition-array absorption feature observed in the X-ray spectrum
of many active galactic nuclei. Similar data are required for Fe^{8+} through
Fe^{12+} to remove the question mark hanging over the atomic data though.",2006-07-18T13:03:59Z
X-ray Properties of Black-Hole Binaries,"We review the properties and behavior X-ray binaries that contain an
accreting black hole. The larger majority of such systems are X-ray transients,
and many of them were observed in daily pointings with RXTE throughout the
course of their outbursts. The complex evolution of these sources is described
in terms of common behavior patterns illustrated with comprehensive overview
diagrams for six selected systems. Central to this comparison are three X-ray
states of accretion, which are reviewed and defined quantitatively. Each state
yields phenomena that arise in strong gravitational fields. We sketch a
scenario for the potential impact of black hole observations on physics and
discuss a current frontier topic: the measurement of black hole spin.",2006-06-14T17:33:14Z
A New Universal Constant Determining Expansion of the Universe,"A new universal constant of expansion has been discovered with amazing
predictive power once its density-time relations have been deciphered. The new
constant is kappa, the product of the gravitational constant, and the average
total mass-energy density of our universe and the square of the cosmic time.
With the ten parameters known, this relation promises to account for the
expansion of our universe from its beginning into the far future. The most
important and most difficult item is cosmic time and its scaling relation with
the densities. The new cosmological theory will be presented in this paper to
show good predictions of the cosmological parameters. The theory will be used
in a second paper to show that acceleration of the expansion rate is not needed
to account globally for the exploding-star supernova Ia radiation that has
traveled such great distances in our expanding universe.",2006-06-14T13:43:42Z
Supernova Neutrinos: The Accretion Disk Scenario,"Neutrinos from core collapse supernovae can be emitted from a rapidly
accreting disk surrounding a black hole, instead of the canonical proto-neutron
star. For Galactic events, detector count rates are considerable and in fact
can be in the thousands for Super-Kamiokande. The rate of occurrence of these
accreting disks in the Galaxy is predicted to be on the order of 10^-5 yr^-1,
yet there is little observational evidence to provide an upper limit on their
formation rate. It would therefore be useful to discriminate between neutrinos
which have been produced in a proto-neutron star and those which have been
produced accretion disks. In order to distinguish between the two scenarios,
either the time profile of the neutrino luminosity or the relative fluxes of
different neutrino flavors may be considered. There are some signals that would
clearly point to one scenario or the other.",2006-05-11T01:03:25Z
A numerical study of non-gaussianity in the curvaton scenario,"We study the curvaton scenario using gauge-invariant second order
perturbation theory and solving the governing equations numerically. Focusing
on large scales we calculate the non-linearity parameter f_nl in the two-fluid
curvaton model and compare our results with previous analytical studies
employing the sudden decay approximation. We find good agreement of the two
approaches for large curvaton energy densities at curvaton decay, Omega_dec,
but significant differences of up to 10 percent for small Omega_dec.",2006-04-18T18:36:28Z
"Perturbation Theory Reloaded: Analytical Calculation of Non-linearity in
  Baryonic Oscillations in the Real Space Matter Power Spectrum","We compare the non-linear matter power spectrum in real space calculated
analytically from 3rd-order perturbation theory with N-body simulations at
1<z<6. We find that the perturbation theory prediction agrees with the
simulations to better than 1% accuracy in the weakly non-linear regime where
the dimensionless power spectrum, Delta^2(k)=k^3P(k)/2pi^2, which approximately
gives variance of matter density field at a given k, is less than 0.4. While
the baryonic acoustic oscillation features are preserved in the weakly
non-linear regime at z>1, the shape of oscillations is distorted from the
linear theory prediction. Nevertheless, our results suggest that one can
correct the distortion caused by non-linearity almost exactly. We also find
that perturbation theory, which does not contain any free parameters, provides
a significantly better fit to the simulations than the conventional approaches
based on empirical fitting functions to simulations. The future work would
include perturbation theory calculations of non-linearity in redshift space
distortion and halo biasing in the weakly non-linear regime.",2006-04-04T21:11:53Z
Do mean-field dynamos in nonrotating turbulent shear-flows exist?,"A plane-shear flow in a fluid with forced turbulence is considered. If the
fluid is electrically-conducting then a mean electromotive force (EMF) results
even without basic rotation and the magnetic diffusivity becomes a highly
anisotropic tensor. It is checked whether in this case self-excitation of a
large-scale magnetic field is possible (so-called WxJ-dynamo) and the answer is
NO. The calculations reveal the cross-stream components of the EMF
perpendicular to the mean current having the wrong signs, at least for small
magnetic Prandtl numbers. After our results numerical simulations with magnetic
Prandtl number of about unity have only a restricted meaning as the Prandtl
number dependence of the diffusivity tensor is rather strong. If, on the other
hand, the turbulence field is stratified in the vertical direction then a
dynamo active alpha-effect is produced. The critical magnetic Reynolds number
for such a self-excitation in a simple shear flow is slightly above 10 like for
the other - but much more complicated - flow patterns used in existing dynamo
experiments with liquid sodium or gallium.",2006-04-18T10:25:14Z
"Confronting quintessence models with recent high-redshift supernovae
  data","We confront the predictions of different quintessence models with recent
measurements of the luminosity distance from two sets of supernovae type Ia. In
particular, we consider the 157 SNe Ia in the Gold dataset with z<1.7, and the
more recent data containing 71 supernovae obtained by the Supernova Legacy
Survey (SNLS) with z<1. We numerically solve the evolution equations for the
Ratra-Peebles inverse power law model, the double exponential and the
hyperbolic cosine quintessence models. We obtain confidence regions from the
two datasets in the \Omega_M-\alpha and \Omega_M-w_\phi planes for the
different models and compare their predictions with dark energy models with
constant equation of state.",2006-04-19T15:53:46Z
Bulk Motion of Ultrarelativistic Conical Blazar Jets,"Allowing for the conical shape of ultrarelativistic blazar jets with opening
angles of a few degrees on parsec-scales we show that their bulk Lorentz
factors and viewing angles can be much larger than the values usually inferred
by combining their flux variability and proper motion measurements. This is in
accord with our earlier finding that such ultrarelativistic (Lorentz factor,
Gamma > 30) conical jets can reconcile the relatively slow apparent motions of
VLBI knots in TeV blazars with the extremely fast flows implied by their rapid
gamma-ray variability. This jet geometry also implies that de-projected jet
opening angles will typically be significantly underestimated from VLBI
measurements. In addition, de-projected jet lengths will be considerably
overestimated if high Lorentz factors and significant opening angles are not
taken into account.",2006-03-27T15:18:58Z
Constraining Torus Models for AGNs Using X-Ray Observations,"In Unification Models, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are believed to be
surrounded by an axisymmetric structure of dust and gas, which greatly
influences their observed properties according to the direction from which they
are observed. The main aim of this work is to constrain the properties of this
obscuring material using X-Ray observations. The distribution of column
densities observed by Chandra in the Chandra Deep Field South is used to
determine geometrical constraints for already proposed torus models. It is
found that the best torus model is given by a classical `donut shape' with an
exponential angular dependency of the density profile. The opening angle is
strongly constrained by the observed column densities. Other proposed torus
models are clearly rejected by the X-Ray observations.",2006-05-31T16:53:35Z
"Abundance analysis of 5 early-type stars in the young open cluster
  IC2391","It is unclear whether chemically peculiar stars of the upper main sequence
represent a class completely distinct from normal A-type stars, or whether
there exists a continuous transition from the normal to the most peculiar late
F- to early B-type stars. A systematic abundance analysis of open cluster
early-type stars would help to relate the observed differences of the chemical
abundances of the photospheres to other stellar characteristics, without being
concerned by possible different original chemical composition. Furthermore, if
a continuous transition region from the very peculiar to the so called normal
A-F stars exists, it should be possible to detect objects with mild
peculiarities. As a first step of a larger project, an abundance analysis of 5
F-A type stars in the young cluster IC2391 was performed using high resolution
spectra obtained with the UVES instrument of the ESO VLT. Our targets seem to
follow a general abundance pattern: close to solar abundance of the light
elements and iron peak elements, heavy elements are slightly overabundant with
respect to the sun, similar to what was found in previous studies of normal
field A-type stars of the galactic plane. We detected a weakly chemically
peculiar star, HD74044. Its element pattern contains characteristics of CP1 as
well as CP2 stars, enhanced abundances of iron peak elements and also higher
abundances of Sc, Y, Ba and Ce. We did not detect a magnetic field in this star
(detection limit was 2kG). We also studied the star SHJM2, proposed as a
pre-main sequence object in previous works. Using spectroscopy we found a high
surface gravity, which suggests that the star is very close to the ZAMS.",2006-04-05T15:38:54Z
A detailed modelling of the chemically rich clumps along the CB3 outflow,"In order to investigate the origin and the structure of the low velocity,
chemically rich clumps observed along the lobes of low- and intermediate-mass
outflows, we construct a detailed model of the S1 clump along the CB3 outflow.
We use a time-dependent chemical model coupled with a radiative transfer model
to reproduce the observed line profile for a direct comparison with previous
observations of this clump. We find that the simultaneous fitting of multiple
species and transitions is a powerful tool in constraining the physical
parameters of the gas. Different scenarios for the clump formation have been
investigated. The models that better reproduce all the observed lines are those
where the clump is formed, at least partially, before the advent of the
outflow; with the advent of the outflow the clump undergoes a short period of
non-dissociative shock and the consequent release of the icy mantle together
with the high temperature chemistry leads to the observed chemical enrichment.
Our results also suggest the presence of substructure within the clump: a more
extended component traced by CS, SO and the lower energy transitions (3_k-2_k
and 2_k-1_k) of CH_3OH, and a more compact component traced by H_2CO, SO_2 and
the higher energy transitions (5_k-4_k) of CH_3OH.",2006-04-28T10:36:01Z
"Study of the Structure of the Coma Cluster Based on a Hierarchical
  Powerful Clustering Method","Six subclusters in the Coma cluster have been selected on the basis of a
hierarchical clustering method that takes the gravitational interaction among
galaxies into account. Of these, three main subclusters around the galaxies NGC
4889, NGC 4874, and NGC 4839 have been singled out. We have used the objective
statistical criterion applied by Vennik and Anosova in studies of close groups
of galaxies to evaluate each member included in a subcluster with a high
probability. Galaxies with a significant deficit of hydrogen HI, including
objects from the Bravo-Alfaro list,have been identified with members of the
subclusters, with the greatest number of them in the subclusters around NGC
4874 and NGC 4839. A quantitative estimate of the hydrogen deficit using the HI
index in the RCG3 catalog reveals a statistically significant excess value for
those galaxies that are members of the subclusters compared to the field
galaxies with a hydrogen deficit in the studied area of Coma cluster. A
substantial number of the spiral galaxies with a hydrogen deficit in the
subclusters turned out to be radio galaxies as well.",2006-04-03T18:50:24Z
Crossing the phantom barrier with purely kinetic multiple k-essence,"We consider multiple k-essence sources and obtain the conditions their
kinetic functions must satisfy so that purely kinetic k-essences lead to models
with phantom barrier crossing. After that, we show that polynomial kinetic
functions allow the integration of the dynamical equations determining the
geometry and the k-fields. The models thus obtained have accelerated expansion
at late cosmic time, representing universes ending at a finite time with a big
rip singularity. In addition, these models begin to evolve from an initial
singularity, so they have a finite time span.",2006-04-05T07:52:31Z
Fomin's conception of quantum cosmogenesis,"The main aim of this paper is to extend the early approach to quantum
cosmogenesis provided by Fomin. His approach was developed independently to the
well-known Tryon description of the creation of the closed universe as a
process of quantum fluctuation of vacuum. We apply the Fomin concept to derive
the cosmological observables. We argue that Fomin's idea from his 1973 work, in
contrast to Tryon's one has impact on the current Universe models and the
proposed extension of his theory now can be tested by distant supernovae SNIa.
Fomin's idea of the creation of the Universe is based on the intersection of
two fundamental theories: general relativity and quantum field theory with the
contemporary cosmological models with dark energy. As a result of comparison
with contemporary approaches concerning dark energy, we found out that Fomin's
idea appears in the context of the present acceleration of the Universe
explanation: cosmological models with decaying vacuum. Contemporary it appears
in the form of Ricci scalar dark energy connected with the holographic
principle. We show also that the Fomin model admits the bounce instead of the
initial singularity. We demonstrate that the Fomin model of cosmogenesis can be
falsified and using SNIa data the values of model parameters is in agreement
with observations.",2006-04-01T11:05:46Z
Disc-Jet coupling in the LMXB 4U1636-53 from INTEGRAL,"We report on the spectral analysis results of the neutron star, atoll type,
low mass X-ray Binary 4U1636-53 observed by INTEGRAL and BeppoSAX satellites.
Spectral behavior in three different epochs corresponding to three different
spectral states has been deeply investigated. Two data set spectra show a
continuum well described by one or two soft blackbody plus a Comptonized
components with changes in the Comptonizing electrons and black body
temperature and the accretion rates, which are typical of the spectral
transitions from high to low state. In one occasion INTEGRAL spectrum shows,
for first time in this source, a hard tail dominating the emission above 30
keV. The total spectrum is fitted as the sum of a Comptonized component similar
to soft state and a power-law component (Gamma=2.76), indicating the presence
of a non thermal electron distribution of velocities. In this case, a
comparison with hard tails detected in soft states from neutron stars systems
and some black hole binaries suggests that a similar mechanism could originate
these components in both cases.",2006-06-30T12:22:25Z
GRB030406 an extremely hard burst outside of the INTEGRAL field of view,"Using the IBIS Compton mode, the INTEGRAL satellite is able to detect and
localize bright and hard GRBs, which happen outside of the nominal INTEGRAL
telescopes field of view. We have developed a method of analyzing such INTEGRAL
data to obtain the burst location and spectra. We present the results for the
case of GRB030406. The burst is localized with the Compton events, and the
location is consistent with the previous Interplanetary Network position. A
spectral analysis is possible with the detailed modeling of the detector
response for such a far off-axis source with the offset of 36.9 $^\circ$. The
average spectrum of the burst is extremely hard: the photon index above 400
\kev is -1.7, with no evidence of a break up to 1.1 \mev at 90% confidence
level.",2006-04-20T15:11:22Z
Gamma-ray binaries: pulsars in disguise ?,"LS 5039 and LSI +61 303 are unique amongst high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXB)
for their spatially-resolved radio emission and their counterpart at >GeV
gamma-ray energies, canonically attributed to non-thermal particles in an
accretion-powered relativistic jet. The only other HMXB known to emit very high
energy (VHE) gamma-rays, PSR B1259-63, harbours a non-accreting millisecond
pulsar. I investigate whether the interaction of the relativistic wind from a
young pulsar with the wind from its stellar companion, as in PSR B1259-63,
constitutes a viable scenario to explain the observations of LS 5039 and LSI
+61 303. Emission would arise from the shocked pulsar wind material, which then
flows away to large distances in a comet-shape tail, reproducing on a smaller
scale what is observed in isolated, high motion pulsars interacting with the
ISM. Simple expectations for the SED are derived and are shown to depend on few
input parameters. Detailed modelling of the particle evolution is compared to
the observations from radio to TeV energies. Acceleration at the shock provides
high energy electrons that steadily emit synchrotron in X-rays and inverse
Compton scatter stellar light to gamma-rays. Electrons streaming out of the
system emit at IR frequencies and below. The overall aspect of the SEDs is
adequately reproduced for standard values of the parameters. The morphology of
the radio tail can mimic a microquasar jet. Good agreement is found with the
published VLBI map of LS 5039 and predictions are made on the expected change
in appearance with orbital phase. The pulsar wind scenario can provide a
common, viable framework to interpret the emission from all three gamma-ray
binaries.",2006-05-11T11:15:55Z
Reionisation scenarios and the temperature of the IGM,"We examine the temperature structure of the IGM due to the passage of
individual ionisation fronts using a radiative transfer (RT) code coupled to a
particle-mesh (PM) N-body code. Multiple simulations were performed with
different spectra of ionising radiation: a power law (goes as nu^{-0.5}),
miniquasar, starburst, and a time-varying spectrum that evolves from a
starburst spectrum to a power law. The RT is sufficiently resolved in time and
space to correctly model both the ionisation state and the temperature across
the ionisation front. We find the post-ionisation temperature of the reionised
intergalactic medium (IGM) is sensitive to the spectrum of the source of
ionising radiation, which may be used to place strong constraints on the nature
of the sources of reionisation. Radiative transfer effects also produce large
fluctuations in the HeII to HI number density ratio eta. The spread in values
is smaller than measured, except for the time-varying spectrum. For this case,
the spread evolves as the spectral nature of the ionising background changes.
Large values for eta are found in partially ionised HeII as the power-law
spectrum begins to dominate the starburst, suggesting that the large eta values
measured may be indicating the onset of the HeII reionisation epoch.",2006-05-12T13:34:37Z
R3 fluids,"With regard to large-scale astrophysical systems, the current paper deals
with (i) formulation of tensor virial equations from the standpoint of
analytical mechanics; (ii) investigation on the role of systematic and random
motions for virial equilibrium configurations; (iii) extent to which systematic
and random motions are equivalent in changing a fluid shape. The tensor virial
equations are formulated using analytical mechanics, and the self
potential-energy tensor is shown to be symmetric. The role of systematic and
random motions in collisionless, ideal, self-gravitating fluids, is analysed in
detail including radial and tangential velocity dispersion on the equatorial
plane. R3 fluids are defined as ideal, self-gravitating fluids in virial
equilibrium, with systematic rotation around a principal axis of inertia, and
ihe related virial equations are formulated. A unified theory of systematic and
random motions is developed for R3 fluids, taking into consideration imaginary
rotation. The effect of random motion excess is shown to be equivalent to an
additional real or imaginary rotation, respectively, inducing flattening or
elongation. R3 fluids are found to admit adjoint configurations with isotropic
random velocity distribution. Further constraints are established on the amount
of random velocity anisotropy along the principal axes, for triaxial
configurations. A necessary condition is formulated for the occurrence of
bifurcation points from axisymmetric to triaxial configurations in virial
equilibrium, which is independent of the anisotropy parameters. In the special
case of homeoidally striated Jacobi ellipsoid, some previously known results
are reproduced.",2006-07-27T05:54:25Z
"Supernova remnant energetics and magnetars: no evidence in favour of
  millisecond proto-neutron stars","It is generally accepted that Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs) and Soft
Gamma-ray Repeaters (SGRs) are magnetars, i.e. neutron stars with extremely
high surface magnetic fields ($B > 10^{14}$ G). The origin of these high
magnetic fields is uncertain, but a popular hypothesis is that magnetars are
born with an initial spin period not much exceeding the convective overturn
time (~3ms), which results in a powerful dynamo action, amplifying the seed
magnetic field to $> ~10^{15}$ G. Part of this rotation energy is then expected
to power the supernova through rapid magnetic braking. It is therefore possible
that magnetars creation is accompanied by supernovae that are an order of
magnitude more energetic than normal supernovae, provided their initial spin
period is ~1 ms. However, we list here evidence that the explosion energies of
these supernova remnants associated with AXPs and SGRs -- Kes 73 (AXP 1E
1841-045), CTB 109 (AXP 1E2259+586) and N49 (SGR 0526-66) -- are close to the
canonical supernova explosion energy of $10^{51}$~erg, suggesting an initial
spin period of > ~5ms.
  We therefore do not find evidence that magnetars are formed from rapidly
rotating proto-neutron stars, allowing for the possibility that they descend
from stellar progenitor with high magnetic field cores, and we discuss the
merits of both formation scenarios.
  In an appendix we describe the analysis of XMM-Newton observations of Kes 73
and N49 used to derive the explosion energies for these remnants.",2006-04-09T20:59:08Z
"Comparison of the Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Ray Flux Observed by AGASA,
  HiRes and Auger","The current measurements of the cosmic ray energy spectrum at ultra-high
energies ($\text{E}>10^{19}$ eV) are characterized by large systematic errors
and poor statistics. In addition, the experimental results of the two
experiments with the largest published data sets, AGASA and HiRes, appear to be
inconsistent with each other, with AGASA seeing an unabated continuation of the
energy spectrum even at energies beyond the GZK cutoff energy at $10^{19.6}$
eV. Given the importance of the related astrophysical questions regarding the
unknown origin of these highly energetic particles, it is crucial that the
extent to which these measurements disagree be well understood. Here we
evaluate the consistency of the two measurements for the first time with a
model-independent method that accounts for the large statistical and systematic
errors of current measurements. We further compare the AGASA and HiRes spectra
with the recently presented Auger spectrum. The method directly compares two
measurements, bypassing the introduction of theoretical models for the shape of
the energy spectrum. The inconsistency between the observations is expressed in
terms of a Bayes Factor, a standard statistic defined as the ratio of a
separate parent source hypothesis to a single parent source hypothesis.
Application to the data shows that the two-parent hypothesis is disfavored. We
expand the method to allow comparisons between an experimental flux and that
predicted by any model.",2006-06-14T14:31:47Z
"Radio and X-ray Properties of Relativistic Beaming Models for
  Ultra-Luminous X-ray Sources","We calculate the broadband radio--X-ray spectra predicted by microblazar and
microquasar models for Ultra-Luminous X-ray sources (ULXs), exploring the
possibility that their dominant power-law component is produced by a
relativistic jet, even at near-Eddington mass accretion rates. We do this by
first constructing a generalized disk--jet theoretical framework in which some
fraction of the total accretion power Pa is efficiently removed from the
accretion disk by a magnetic torque responsible for jet formation. Thus, for
different black hole masses, mass accretion rates and magnetic coupling
strength, we self-consistently calculate the relative importance of the
modified disk spectrum, as well as the overall jet emission due to synchrotron
and Compton processes. In general, transferring accretion power to a jet makes
the disk fainter and cooler than a standard disk at the same mass accretion
rate; this may explain why the soft spectral component appears less prominent
than the dominant power-law component in most bright ULXs. We show that the
apparent X-ray luminosity and spectrum predicted by the microquasar model are
consistent with the observed properties of most ULXs. We predict that the radio
synchrotron jet emission is too faint to be detected at the typical threshold
of radio surveys to date. This is consistent with the high rate of
non-detections over detections in radio counterpart searches. Conversely, we
conclude that the observed radio emission found associated with a few ULXs
cannot be due to beamed synchrotron emission from a relativistic jet.",2006-06-29T03:30:48Z
"XMM-Newton observation of the Be/neutron star system RX J0146.9+6121: a
  soft X-ray excess in a low luminosity accreting pulsar","We report on the XMM-Newton observation of the Be/neutron star X-ray binary
system RX J0146.9+6121, a long period (~ 23 m) pulsar in the NGC 663 open
cluster. The X-ray luminosity decreased by a factor two compared to the last
observation carried out in 1998, reaching a level of ~ 10^34 erg/s, the lowest
ever observed in this source. The spectral analysis reveals the presence of a
significant excess at low energies over the main power-law spectral component.
The soft excess can be described by a black-body spectrum with a temperature of
about 1 keV and an emitting region with a radius of ~ 140 m. Although the
current data do not permit to ascertain whether the soft excess is pulsed or
not, its properties are consistent with emission from the neutron star polar
cap. This is the third detection of a soft excess in a low luminosity (~ 10^34
erg/s) pulsar, the other being X Per and 3A 0535+262, suggesting that such
spectral component, observed up to date in higher luminosity systems, is a
rather common feature of accreting X-ray pulsars. The results on these three
sources indicate that, in low luminosity systems, the soft excess tends to have
a higher temperature and a smaller surface area than in the high luminosity
ones.",2006-04-10T08:25:18Z
"Swift, RXTE, and INTEGRAL observation of Swift J1922.7-1716","We report the results of analyzing Swift, RossiXTE, and INTEGRAL data of
Swift J1922.7-1716, a likely transient X-ray source discovered by Swift/BAT.
Both the fast variability measured by the RXTE/PCA and the combined Swift/XRT,
RXTE/PCA, and INTEGRAL/ISGRI (0.5-100 keV) energy spectrum suggest that the
system is a neutron-star low-mass X-ray binary or a black-hole candidate at low
accretion levels. The non-simultaneous spectra are consistent with the same
spectral shape and flux, suggesting little variability over the period July to
October 2005, but the analysis of archival INTEGRAL data shows that the source
was not detected in 2003-2004, suggesting a transient or strongly variable
behavior.",2006-07-11T14:01:06Z
"Angular distribution of satellite galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky
  Survey Data Release 4","We explore the angular distribution of two samples of satellite galaxies
orbiting isolated hosts extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data
Release 4. We find a clear alignment of the satellites along the major axis of
their hosts when restricting the analysis to red hosts. The anisotropy is most
pronounced for red satellites of red hosts. We find that the distribution of
the satellites about blue, isolated hosts is consistent with isotropy. We show
that under the assumption that the true, underlying distribution of satellites
of blue hosts exhibits the same anisotropy as the satellites of red hosts, the
sample of blue hosts is too small to measure this anisotropy at a
statistically-significant level. The anisotropy that we detect for satellites
about red primaries is independent of the projected radius. In particular, it
is evident at large projected distances from primaries (300 < r_p < 500 kpc).",2006-07-07T18:15:36Z
"Astrometric Detection of Terrestrial Planets in the Habitable Zones of
  Nearby Stars with SIM PlanetQuest","SIM PlanetQuest (Space Interferometry Mission) is a space-borne Michelson
interferometer for precision stellar astrometry, with a nine meter baseline,
currently slated for launch in 2015. One of the principal science goals is the
astrometric detection and orbit characterization of terrestrial planets in the
habitable zones of nearby stars. Differential astrometry of the target star
against a set of reference stars lying within a degree will allow measurement
of the target star's reflex motion with astrometric accuracy of 1
micro-arcsecond in a single measurement.
  We assess SIM's capability for detection (as opposed to characterization by
orbit determination) of terrestrial planets in the habitable zones of nearby
solar-type stars. We compare SIM's performance on target lists optimized for
the SIM and Terrestrial Planet Finder Coronograph (TPF-C) missions. Performance
is quantified by three metrics: minimum detectable planet mass, number and mass
distribution of detected planets, and completeness of detections in each mass
range. Finally, we discuss the issue of confidence in detections and
non-detections, and show how information from SIM's planet survey can enable
TPF to increase its yield of terrestrial planets.",2006-03-24T18:16:35Z
"Evolution of Photosynthesis and Biospheric Oxygenation Contingent Upon
  Nitrogen Fixation?","How photosynthesis by Precambrian cyanobacteria oxygenated Earth's biosphere
remains incompletely understood. Here it is argued that the oxic transition,
which took place between approximately 2.3 and 0.5 Gyr ago, required a great
proliferation of cyanobacteria, and this in turn depended on their ability to
fix nitrogen via the nitrogenase enzyme system. However, the ability to fix
nitrogen was not a panacea, and the rate of biospheric oxygenation may still
have been affected by nitrogen constraints on cyanobacterial expansion.
Evidence is presented for why cyanobacteria probably have a great need for
fixed nitrogen than other prokaryotes, underscoring the importance of their
ability to fix nitrogen. The connection between nitrogen fixation and the
evolution of photosynthesis is demonstrated by the similarities between
nitrogenase and enzymes critical for the biosynthesis of (bacterio)chlorophyll.
It is hypothesized that biospheric oxygenation would not have occurred if the
emergence of cyanobacteria had not been preceded by the evolution of nitrogen
fixation, and if these organisms had not also acquired the ability to fix
nitrogen at the beginning of or very early in their history. The evolution of
nitrogen fixation also appears to have been a precondition for the evolution of
(bacterio)chlorophyll-based photosynthesis. Given that some form of chlorophyll
is obligatory for true photosynthesis, and its light absorption and chemical
properties make it a ""universal pigment,"" it may be predicted that the
evolution of nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis are also closely linked on
other Earth- like planets.",2006-05-12T01:12:48Z
On mini-halo encounters with stars,"We study, analytically and numerically, the energy input into dark matter
mini-haloes by interactions with stars. We find that the fractional energy
input in simulations of Plummer spheres agrees well with the impulse
approximation for small and large impact parameters, with a rapid transition
between these two regimes. Using the impulse approximation the fractional
energy input at large impact parameters is fairly independent of the mass and
density profile of the mini-halo, however low-mass mini-haloes experience a
greater fractional energy input in close encounters. We formulate a fitting
function which encodes these results and use it to estimate the disruption
timescales of mini-haloes, taking into account the stellar velocity dispersion
and mass distribution. For mini-haloes with mass M< {\cal O}(10^{-7} M_{\odot}
on typical orbits which pass through the disc, we find that the estimated
disruption timescales are independent of mini-halo mass, and are of order the
age of the Milky Way. For more massive mini-haloes the estimated disruption
timescales increase rapidly with increasing mass.",2006-04-06T17:17:56Z
"Spitzer IRS spectra of a large sample of Seyfert galaxies: a variety of
  infrared SEDs in the local AGN population","We are conducting a large observing program with the Spitzer Space Telescope
to determine the mid-to-far infrared spectral energy distributions of a
well-defined sample of 87 nearby, 12 micron-selected Seyfert galaxies. In this
paper we present the results of IRS low-resolution spectroscopy of a
statistically representative subsample of 51 of the galaxies (59%), with an
analysis of the continuum shapes and a comparison of the Seyfert types. We find
that the spectra clearly divide into groups based on their continuum shapes and
spectral features. Some spectral features are clearly related to a starburst
contribution to the IR spectrum, while the mechanisms producing observed
power-law continuum shapes, attributed to an AGN component, may be dust or
non-thermal emission. The infrared spectral types appear to be related to the
Seyfert types. Principal component analysis results suggest that the relative
contribution of starburst emission may be the dominant cause of variance in the
observed spectra. We find that Sy 1's have higher ratios of IR/radio emission
than Sy 2's, as predicted by the unified model if the torus is optically thick
in the mid-IR. However, smooth-density torus models predict a much larger
difference between type 1's and 2's than observed in our sample. Our
observations may be consistent with clumpy torus models containing a steep
radial distribution of optically thick dense clumps. (Abridged)",2006-04-10T21:56:15Z
"Mass spectrum of primordial black holes from inflationary perturbation
  in the Randall-Sundrum braneworld: a limit on blue spectra","The mass spectrum of the primordial black holes formed by density
perturbation in the radiation-dominated era of the Randall-Sundrum type-2
cosmology is given. The spectrum coincides with standard four-dimensional one
on large scales but the deviation is apparent on smaller scales. The mass
spectrum is initially softer than standard four-dimensional one, while after
accretion during the earliest era it becomes harder than that. We also show
expected extragalactic diffuse photon background spectra varying the initial
perturbation power-law power spectrum and give constraints on the blue spectra
and/or the reheating temperature. The most recent observations on the small
scale density perturbation from WMAP, SDSS and Lyman-\alpha Forest are used.
What we get are interpreted as constraints on the smaller scale inflation on
the brane connected to the larger one at the scale of Lyman-\alpha Forest. If
we set the bulk curvature radius to be 0.1 mm and assume the reheating
temperature is higher than 10^6 GeV, the scalar spectral index from the smaller
scale inflation is constrained to be n \lesssim 1.3. Typically, the constraints
are tighter than standard four-dimensional one, which is also revised by us
using the most recent observations.",2006-03-19T00:01:40Z
Limit on the Neutrino Mass from the WMAP Three Year Data,"We derive an upper limit on the neutrino mass from the WMAP three-year data
alone by employing a deterministic minimisation method based on a grid search
in multi-parameter space. Assuming the flat LCDM model with power-law adiabatic
perturbations, we find the sum of m_nu < 2.0 eV in agreement with the result of
the WMAP team. This result, the limit being nearly the same as that from the
WMAP first-year data, means that the fundamental limit on the neutrino mass
obtainable from the cosmic microwave background alone is already nearly met, as
anticipated from the previous analysis. We also clarify the role of the
polarisation data in deriving the limit on the neutrino mass.",2006-05-15T14:50:14Z
"Luminosity functions for galaxies and quasars in the Spitzer Wide-Area
  Infrared Extra-galactic (SWIRE) Legacy survey","We construct rest-frame luminosity functions at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8 and 24
microns over the redshift range 0<z<2 for galaxies and 0<z<4 for optical QSOs,
using optical and infrared data from the Spitzer Wide-area InfraRed
Extragalactic survey. The 3.6 and 4.5 micron galaxy LFs show evidence for
moderate positive luminosity evolution up to z~1.5, consistent with the passive
ageing of evolved stellar populations. Their comoving luminosity density was
found to evolve passively, gradually increasing out to z~0.5-1 but flattening,
or even declining, at higher redshift. Conversely, the 24 micron galaxy LF,
which is more sensitive to obscured star formation and/or AGN activity,
undergoes strong positive evolution, with the derived IR energy density and SFR
density proportional to (1+z)^gamma with gamma=4.5^{+0.7}_{-0.6} and the
majority of this evolution occurring since z~1. Optical QSOs, however, show
positive luminosity evolution in all bands, out to the highest redshifts
(3<z<4). Modelling as L* proportional to (1+z)^gamma gave
gamma=1.3^{+0.1}_{-0.1} at 3.6 micron, gamma=1.0^{+0.1}_{-0.1} at 4.5 micron
and stronger evolution at the longer wavelengths (5.8, 8 and 24 micron), of
gamma~3. Comparison of the galaxy LFs to predictions from a semi-analytic model
based on CDM indicate that an IMF skewed towards higher mass star formation in
bursts compared to locally is preferred. As a result the currently inferred
massive star formation rates in distant sub-mm sources may require substantial
downwards revision.",2006-05-11T20:31:19Z
Adaptive Optics Imaging Survey of Luminous Infrared Galaxies,"We present high resolution imaging observations of a sample of previously
unidentified far-infrared galaxies at z < 0.3. The objects were selected by
cross-correlating the IRAS Faint Source Catalog with the VLA FIRST catalog and
the HST Guide Star Catalog to allow for adaptive optics observations. We found
two new ULIGs (with L_FIR equal to or greater than 10^{12} L_sun) and 19 new
LIGs (with L_FIR equal to or greater than 10^{11} L_sun). Twenty of the
galaxies in the sample were imaged with either the Lick or Keck adaptive optics
systems in H or K'. Galaxy morphologies were determined using the two
dimensional fitting program GALFIT and the residuals examined to look for
interesting structure. The morphologies reveal that at least 30% are involved
in tidal interactions, with 20% being clear mergers. An additional 50% show
signs of possible interaction. Line ratios were used to determine powering
mechanism; of the 17 objects in the sample showing clear emission lines - four
are active galactic nuclei and seven are starburst galaxies. The rest exhibit a
combination of both phenomena.",2006-03-15T19:59:12Z
Remarks on Rapid vs. Slow Star Formation,"We discuss problems with some observational estimates indicating long
protostellar core lifetimes and large stellar age spreads in molecular clouds.
We also point out some additional observational constraints which suggest that
protostellar cores do not have long lifetimes before collapsing. For external
galaxies, we argue that the widths of spiral arms does not imply a long
star-formation process, since the formation of massive stars will disrupt
molecular clouds, move material around, compress it in other regions which
produce new star-forming clouds. Thus, it seems unavoidable that this cyclical
process will result in an extended period of enhanced star formation, which
does not represent the survival time of any individual molecular cloud. We
argue that the rapid star formation indicated observationally is also easier to
understand theoretically than the traditional scenario of slow quasi-static
contraction with ambipolar diffusion.",2006-05-10T17:59:58Z
"Structure of pair winds from compact objects with application to
  emission from bare strange stars","We present the results of numerical simulations of stationary, spherically
outflowing, electron-positron pair winds, with total luminosities in the range
10^{34}- 10^{42} ergs/s. In the concrete example described here, the wind
injection source is a hot, bare, strange star, predicted to be a powerful
source of electron-positron pairs created by the Coulomb barrier at the quark
surface. We find that photons dominate in the emerging emission, and the
emerging photon spectrum is rather hard and differs substantially from the
thermal spectrum expected from a neutron star with the same luminosity. This
might help distinguish the putative bare strange stars from neutron stars.",2006-06-25T11:07:21Z
"Chemical Evolution of the Galactic Bulge as Derived from High-Resolution
  Infrared Spectroscopy of K and M Red Giants","We present chemical abundances in K and M red-giant members of the Galactic
bulge derived from high-resolution infrared spectra obtained with the Phoenix
spectrograph on Gemini-South. The elements studied are carbon, nitrogen,
oxygen, sodium, titanium, and iron. The evolution of C and N abundances in the
studied red-giants show that their oxygen abundances represent the original
values with which the stars were born. Oxygen is a superior element for probing
the timescale of bulge chemical enrichment via [O/Fe] versus [Fe/H]. The
[O/Fe]-[Fe/H] relation in the bulge does not follow the disk relation, with
[O/Fe] values falling above those of the disk. Titanium also behaves similarly
to oxygen with respect to iron. Based on these elevated values of [O/Fe] and
[Ti/Fe] extending to large Fe abundances, it is suggested that the bulge
underwent a more rapid chemical enrichment than the halo. In addition, there
are declines in both [O/Fe] and [Ti/Fe] in those bulge targets with the largest
Fe abundances, signifying another source affecting chemical evolution: perhaps
Supernovae of Type Ia. Sodium abundances increase dramatically in the bulge
with increasing metallicity, possibly reflecting the metallicity dependant
yields from supernovae of Type II, although Na contamination from H-burning in
intermediate mass stars cannot be ruled out.",2006-07-17T19:36:59Z
"Interacting Vector-like Dark Energy, the First and Second Cosmological
  Coincidence Problems","One of the puzzles of the dark energy problem is the (first) cosmological
coincidence problem, namely, {\em why does our universe begin the accelerated
expansion recently? why are we living in an epoch in which the dark energy
density and the dust matter energy density are comparable?} On the other hand,
cosmological observations hint that the equation-of-state parameter (EoS) of
dark energy crossed the phantom divide $w_{de}=-1$ in the near past. Many dark
energy models whose EoS can cross the phantom divide have been proposed.
However, to our knowledge, these models with crossing the phantom divide only
provide the possibility that $w_{de}$ can cross -1. They do not answer another
question, namely, {\em why crossing the phantom divide occurs recently?} Since
in many existing models whose EoS can cross the phantom divide, $w_{de}$
undulates around -1 randomly, {\em why are we living in an epoch $w_{de}<-1$?}
This can be regarded as the second cosmological coincidence problem. In this
work, the cosmological evolution of the vector-like dark energy interacting
with background perfect fluid is investigated. We find that the first and
second cosmological coincidence problems can be alleviated at the same time in
this scenario.",2006-03-02T15:54:10Z
"Statistical Study of the Reconnection Rate in Solar Flares Observed with
  YOHKOH/SXT","We report a statistical study of flares observed with the Soft X-ray
Telescope (SXT) onboard Yohkoh in the year of 2000. We measure physical
parameters of 77 flares, such as the temporal scale, the size, and the magnetic
flux density and find that the sizes of flares tend to be distributed more
broadly as the GOES class becomes weaker and that there is a lower limit of
magnetic flux density that depends on the GOES class. We also examine the
relationship between these parameters and find weak correlation between
temporal and spatial scales of flares. We estimate reconnection inflow
velocity, coronal Alfven velocity, and reconnection rate using above observed
values. The inflow velocities are distributed from a few km/s to several tens
km/s and the Alfven velocities in the corona are in the range from 10^3 to 10^4
km/s. Hence the reconnection rate is 10^-3 - 10^-2. We find that the
reconnection rate in a flare tends to decrease as the GOES class of the flare
increases. This value is within one order of magnitude from the theoretical
maximum value predicted by the Petschek model, although the dependence of the
reconnection rate on the magnetic Reynolds number tends to be stronger than
that in the Petschek model.",2006-05-30T07:58:39Z
Heavy Element Abundances in Giant Stars of 47 Tuc,"This research forms part of an investigation into heavy element abundances in
Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars in various stellar environments. Seven
giant stars in the southern globular cluster 47 Tuc have been observed using
the Anglo-Australian Telescope. Abundances for five s- and r- process elements
have been determined: the light s-process elements, Y and Zr; the heavy
s-process elements, La and Nd; and the r-process element Eu. Mean enhancements
in the light s-process, [ls/Fe], of ~+0.6 dex and heavy s-process elements,
[hs/Fe], of ~+0.3 dex were determined for all the giant stars. There was no
statistically significant difference between the abundances determined for the
Red Giant Branch (RGB) and AGB stars in this study. The results for the RGB
stars differ from those obtained by a number of previous studies. However,
because of the similar abundance results obtained for the AGB and RGB stars in
this study we believe this provides evidence for previous enrichment of the
material from which these stars formed.",2006-05-21T20:40:01Z
Fe II Emission in 14 Low-Redshift Quasars: I - Observations,"We present the spectra of 14 quasars with a wide coverage of rest wavelengths
from 1000 to 7300 A. The redshift ranges from z = 0.061 to 0.555 and the
luminosity from M_{B} = -22.69 to -26.32. We describe the procedure of
generating the template spectrum of Fe II line emission from the spectrum of a
narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy I Zw 1 that covers two wavelength regions of
2200-3500 A and 4200-5600 A. Our template Fe II spectrum is semi-empirical in
the sense that the synthetic spectrum calculated with the CLOUDY
photoionization code is used to separate the Fe II emission from the Mg II
line. The procedure of measuring the strengths of Fe II emission lines is
twofold; (1) subtracting the continuum components by fitting models of the
power-law and Balmer continua in the continuum windows which are relatively
free from line emissions, and (2) fitting models of the Fe II emission based on
the Fe II template to the continuum-subtracted spectra. From 14 quasars, we
obtained the Fe II fluxes in five wavelength bands, the total flux of Balmer
continuum, and the fluxes of Mg II, Halpha, and other emission lines, together
with the full width at half maxima (FWHMs) of these lines. Regression analysis
was performed by assuming a linear relation between any two of these
quantities. Eight correlations were found with a confidence level higher than
99%. The fact that six of these eight are related to FWHM or M_{BH} may imply
that M_{BH} is a fundamental quantity that controls Gamma or the spectral
energy distribution (SED) of the incident continuum, which in turn controls the
Fe II emission. Furthermore, it is worthy of noting that Fe II(O1)/Fe II(U1) is
found to tightly correlate with Fe II(O1)/Mg II, but not with Fe II(U1)/Mg II.",2006-06-02T04:18:52Z

4.8 and 6.2GHz observations. Functional forms for the rest-frame spectral
energy distributions are derived: 89% of the sample is well characterised by a
single power law, whilst the remaining 11% show some flattening toward higher
frequencies: not one source shows any evidence for high frequency steepening.
We discuss the implications of this result in light of the empirical
correlation between redshift and spectral index seen in flux limited samples of
radio galaxies. Finally, a new physical mechanism to explain the redshift --
spectral index correlation is posited: extremely steep spectrum radio galaxies
in the local universe usually reside at the centres of rich galaxy clusters. We
argue that if a higher fraction of radio galaxies, as a function of redshift,
are located in environments with densities similar to nearby rich clusters,
then this could be a natural interpretation for the correlation. We briefly
outline our plans to pursue this line of investigation.",2006-06-20T05:54:35Z
Hard X-ray emission from the Galactic ridge,"We present results of a study of the Galactic ridge X-ray emission (GRXE) in
hard X-rays performed with the IBIS telescope aboard INTEGRAL. The imaging
capabilities of this coding aperture telescope make it possible to account for
the flux from bright Galactic point sources whereas the wide field of view
permits to collect large flux from the underlying GRXE. Extensive study of the
IBIS/ISGRI detector background allowed us to construct a model that predicts
the detector count rate with $\sim1-2$% accuracy in the energy band 17-60 keV.
The derived longitude and latitude profiles of the ridge emission are in good
agreement with the Galactic distribution of stars obtained from infrared
observations. This, along with the measured hard X-ray spectrum of the Galactic
ridge emission strongly indicates its stellar origin. The derived unit stellar
mass emissivity of the ridge in the energy band 17-60 keV, $(0.9 - 1.2)\times
10^{27}$\lummass (assuming a bulge mass of $1-1.3 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$)
agrees with that of local (in the Solar neigborhood) accreting magnetic white
dwarf binaries - dominant contributors to the GRXE at these energies. In
addition, the shape of the obtained GRXE spectrum can be used to determine the
average mass of white dwarfs in such systems in the Galaxy as $\sim0.5
M_{\sun}$. The total hard X-ray luminosity of the GRXE is $L_{\rm 17-60 keV}
=(3.7\pm0.2)\times10^{37}$\lum in the 17--60 keV band. At energies 70--200 keV
no additional contribution to the total emission of the Galaxy apart from the
detected point sources is seen.",2006-05-17T16:17:11Z
Seeing the sky through Hubble's eye: The COSMOS SkyWalker,"Large, high-resolution space-based imaging surveys produce a volume of data
that is difficult to present to the public in a comprehensible way. While
megapixel-sized images can still be printed out or downloaded via the World
Wide Web, this is no longer feasible for images with 10^9 pixels (e.g., the
Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys [ACS] images of the Galaxy
Evolution from Morphology and SEDs [GEMS] project) or even 10^10 pixels (for
the ACS Cosmic Evolution Survey [COSMOS]). We present a Web-based utility
called the COSMOS SkyWalker that allows viewing of the huge ACS image data set,
even through slow Internet connections. Using standard HTML and JavaScript, the
application successively loads only those portions of the image at a time that
are currently being viewed on the screen. The user can move within the image by
using the mouse or interacting with an overview image. Using an astrometrically
registered image for the COSMOS SkyWalker allows the display of calibrated
world coordinates for use in science. The SkyWalker ""technique"" can be applied
to other data sets. This requires some customization, notably the slicing up of
a data set into small (e.g., 256^2 pixel) subimages. An advantage of the
SkyWalker is the use of standard Web browser components; thus, it requires no
installation of any software and can therefore be viewed by anyone across many
operating systems.",2006-07-23T22:16:16Z
A general model for the identification of specific PAHs in the far-IR,"Context. In the framework of the interstellar PAH hypothesis, far-IR skeletal
bands are expected to be a fingerprint of single species in this class. Aims. A
detailed model of the photophysics of interstellar PAHs is required for such
single-molecule identification of their far-IR features in the presently
available Infrared Space Observatory data and in those of the forthcoming
Herschel Space Observatory mission. Methods. We modelled the detailed
photophysics of a vast sample of species in different radiation fields, using a
compendium of Monte-Carlo techniques and quantum-chemical calculations. This
enabled us to validate the use of purely theoretical data and assess the
expected accuracy and reliability of the resulting synthetic far-IR emission
spectra. Results. We produce positions and intensities of the expected far-IR
features which ought to be emitted by each species in the sample in the
considered radiation fields. A composite emission spectrum for our sample is
computed for one of the most favourable sources for detection, namely the Red
Rectangle nebula. The resulting spectrum is compared with the estimated dust
emission in the same source, to assess the dependence of detectability on key
molecular parameters. Conclusions. Identifying specific PAHs from their far-IR
features is going to be a difficult feat in general, still it may well be
possible under favourable conditions.",2006-06-12T09:54:32Z
The Metal-Strong Damped Lyman-alpha Systems,"We have identified a metal-strong (logN(Zn+) > 13.15 or logN(Si+) > 15.95)
DLA (MSDLA) population from an automated quasar (QSO) absorber search in the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 3 (SDSS-DR3) quasar sample, and find that
MSDLAs comprise ~5% of the entire DLA population with z_abs > 2.2 found in QSO
sightlines with r < 19.5. We have also acquired 27 Keck ESI follow-up spectra
of metal-strong candidates to evaluate our automated technique and examine the
MSDLA candidates at higher resolution. We demonstrate that the rest equivalent
widths of strong ZnII 2026 and SiII 1808 lines in low-resolution SDSS spectra
are accurate metal-strong indicators for higher-resolution spectra, and predict
the observed equivalent widths and signal-to-noise ratios needed to detect
certain extremely weak lines with high-resolution instruments. We investigate
how the MSDLAs may affect previous studies concerning a dust-obscuration bias
and the N(HI)-weighted cosmic mean metallicity <Z(z)>. Finally, we include a
brief discussion of abundance ratios in our ESI sample and find that underlying
mostly Type II supernovae enrichment are differential depletion effects due to
dust (and in a few cases quite strong); we present here a handful of new Ti and
Mn measurements, both of which are useful probes of depletion in DLAs. Future
papers will present detailed examinations of particularly metal-strong DLAs
from high-resolution KeckI/HIRES and VLT/UVES spectra.",2006-07-18T21:15:33Z
Probing the temporal variability of Cygnus X-1 into the soft state,"Building on results from previous studies of Cygnus~X-1, we analyze Rossi
X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) data taken when the source was in the soft and
transitional spectral states. We look at the power spectrum in the 0.01 -- 50
Hz range, using a model consisting of a cut-off power-law and two Lorentzian
components. We are able to constrain the relation between the characteristic
frequencies of the Lorentzian components, and show that it is consistent with a
power-law relation having the same index (1.2) as previously reported for the
hard state, but shifted by a factor ~2. Furthermore, it is shown that the
change in the frequency relation seen during the transitions can be explained
by invoking a shift of one Lorentzian component to a higher harmonic, and we
explore the possible support for this interpretation in the other component
parameters. With the improved soft state results we study the evolution of the
fractional variance for each temporal component. This approach indicates that
the two Lorentzian components are connected to each other, and unrelated to the
power-law component in the power spectrum, pointing to at least two separate
emission components.",2006-03-13T14:32:29Z
"Spectral and variability properties of LS 5039 from radio to very
  high-energy gamma-rays","Microquasars are X-ray binaries with relativistic jets. The microquasar LS
5039 turned out to be the first high-energy gamma-ray microquasar candidate due
to its likely association with the EGRET source 3EG J1824-1514. Further
theoretical studies supported this association, which could be extended to
other EGRET sources. Very recently, Aharonian et al. (2005) have communicated
the detection of the microquasar LS 5039 at TeV energies. This fact confirms
the EGRET source association and leaves no doubt about the gamma-ray emitting
nature of this object. The aim of the present work is to show that, applying a
cold-matter dominated jet model to LS 5039, we can reproduce many of the
spectral and variability features observed in this source. Jet physics is
explored, and some physical quantities are estimated as a by-product of the
performed modeling. Although at the moment only LS 5039 has been detected on
the entire electromagnetic spectrum, it does not seem unlikely that other
microquasars will show similar spectral properties. Therefore, an in-depth
study of the first gamma-ray microquasar, on theoretical grounds supported by
observations, can render a useful knowledge applicable elsewhere.",2006-05-19T11:27:20Z
High-resolution X-ray Spectroscopy of BD +30 3639,"We present preliminary results from the first X-ray gratings spectrometer
observations of a planetary nebula (PN). We have used the Chandra X-ray
Observatory Low Energy Transmission Gratings Spectrometer (LETGS) to observe
the bright, diffuse X-ray source within the well-studied BD +30 3639. The LETGS
spectrum of BD +30 3639 displays prominent and well-resolved emission lines of
H-like C, O, and Ne and He-like O and Ne. Initial modeling indicates a plasma
temperature T_x ~ 2.5x10^6 K and abundance ratios of C/O ~ 20, N/O <~ 1, Ne/O ~
4, and Fe/O <~ 0.1. These results suggest that the X-ray-emitting plasma is
dominated by the shocked fast wind from the emerging PN core, where this wind
gas likely originated from the intershell region of the progenitor asymptotic
giant branch star.",2006-07-07T20:21:04Z
Crossing the phantom barrier with purely kinetic multiple k-essence,"We consider multiple k-essence sources and obtain the conditions their
kinetic functions must satisfy so that purely kinetic k-essences lead to models
with phantom barrier crossing. After that, we show that polynomial kinetic
functions allow the integration of the dynamical equations determining the
geometry and the k-fields. The models thus obtained have accelerated expansion
at late cosmic time, representing universes ending at a finite time with a big
rip singularity. In addition, these models begin to evolve from an initial
singularity, so they have a finite time span.",2006-04-05T07:52:31Z
"Microlensing in phase space I: Continuous propagation of variability
  moments","A method to calculate the statistical properties of microlensing light curves
is developed. The approach follows works by Deguchi & Watson, Seitz & Schneider
and Neindorf, attempting to clarify the ideas involved and techniques used in
the calculations. The method is then modified to include scattering by multiple
lensing planes along the line of sight and transition to a continuous limit of
this treatment for average quantities is performed leading to a Fokker-Planck
type equation. The equation is solved for a particular model of the random star
field and microlensing effect on the flux temporal variability is extracted.
Applications in astrophysically relevant situations are discussed.",2006-04-13T13:50:27Z
The nature of the DLS fast transients,"The discovery and study of highly transient sources, especially those which
rise to high brightness and then fade to obscurity, has been a major part of
modern astrophysics. Well known examples include supernovae and novae. A
byproduct of the Deep Lens Survey was the discovery of three transients which
varied on a timescale of less than an hour. All three had faint and red
counterparts, the brightest of which was identified with an M star. However,
the remaining two showed hints of an extragalactic origin, one had a spatially
extended counterpart and the other appeared in projection on the outskirts of a
bright elliptical galaxy. If these two sources were really of an extragalactic
origin then the two events represent a new class of exotic explosive
transients. We undertook spectroscopic observations with the Keck telescope and
find the two counterparts are also late type Galactic dwarfs. Our main
conclusion is that flares from M dwarfs constitute a dense foreground fog and
dominate over any plausible class of extragalactic fast transients by at least
two orders of magnitude. Overcoming this fog will likely require dedicated
surveys with careful optimization of target field location, filter(s) and
cadence, pre-search imaging to filter out late type dwarfs and a well planned
rapid followup plan.",2006-04-16T18:30:35Z
"A Fundamental Relation Between Compact Stellar Nuclei, Supermassive
  Black Holes, and Their Host Galaxies","Imaging surveys with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have shown that roughly
50-80% of low- and intermediate-luminosity galaxies contain a compact stellar
nucleus at their center, regardless of host galaxy morphological type. We
combine HST imaging for early-type galaxies from the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey
with ground-based long-slit spectra from KPNO to show that the masses of
compact stellar nuclei in Virgo Cluster galaxies obey a tight correlation with
the masses of the host galaxies. The same correlation is obeyed by the
supermassive black holes (SBHs) found in predominantly massive galaxies. The
compact stellar nuclei in the Local Group galaxies M33 and NGC205 are also
found to fall along this same scaling relation. These results indicate that a
generic by-product of galaxy formation is the creation of a Central Massive
Object (CMO) -- either a SBH or a compact stellar nucleus -- that contains a
mean fraction, ~ 0.2%, of the total galactic mass. In galaxies with masses
greater than a few times 10^10 solar masses, SBHs appear to be the dominant
mode of CMO formation.",2006-03-30T23:04:30Z
Dynamics of Rarefaction Waves in General-Relativistic Collapsing Clouds,"Formation and evolution of general relativistic collapse inhomogeneity is
investigated. It is shown that a rarefaction wave forms at initial collapse
stages and propagates inside from the cloud boundary to its center. The
focusing time of the rarefaction wave is found. In massive clouds, the
rarefaction wave focusing time equals the free-fall time. The collapse of such
clouds leads to black hole formation. In low-mass clouds, the rarefaction wave
focusing time is less than the free-fall time. After focusing, the collapse of
such clouds becomes fully inhomogeneous and can be sufficiently decelerated by
the pressure gradient.",2006-07-23T07:54:27Z
An Activity Catalogue of Southern Stars,"We have acquired high-resolution echelle spectra of 225 F6-M5 type stars in
the southern hemisphere. The stars are targets or candidates to be targets for
the Anglo-Australian Planet Search. CaII HK line cores were used to derive
activity indices for all of these objects. The indices were converted to the
Mt. Wilson system of measurements and logR'HK values determined. A number of
these stars had no previously derived activity indices. In addition we have
also included the stars from Tinney et al. (2002) using our Mt. Wilson
calibration. The radial-velocity instability (also known as jitter) level was
determined for all 21 planet-host stars in our dataset. We find the jitter to
be at a level considerably below the radial-velocity signatures in all but one
of these systems. 19 stars from our sample were found to be active (logR'HK >
-4.5) and thus have high levels of jitter. Radial-velocity analysis for
planetary companions to these stars should precede with caution.",2006-07-14T16:05:20Z
NGC 3310 and Its Tidal Debris: Remnants of Galaxy Evolution,"NGC 3310 is a local galaxy with an intense, ongoing starburst thought to
result from a merger with a companion galaxy. It has several known tidal
features in the northwest and southern regions around the main galactic disc,
as well as a closed, tidal loop emerging from the eastern side of the disc and
rejoining in the north. This loop appears to be distinct from the rest of the
shells surrounding NGC3310 and is the first of its kind to be detected in a
starburst galaxy. In this work, we present UBVR photometry to faint surface
brightness levels of this debris network, and we explore various strategies for
modelling NGC 3310's disc and subtracting its contribution from each region of
debris. We then compare these photometric results with the GALEV spectral
synthesis models, and find possible material from the intruder galaxy,
suggesting that the recent accretion of several small galaxies is driving the
evolution of NGC 3310.",2006-07-05T20:26:21Z
Stability Limits in Extra-solar Planetary Systems,"Two types of stability boundaries exist for any planetary system consisting
of one star and two planets. Lagrange stability requires that the planets
remain bound to the star, conserves the ordering of the distance from the star,
and limits the variations of orbital elements like semi-major axis and
eccentricity. Hill stability only requires that the ordering of the planets
remain constant; the outer planet may escape to infinity. A simple formula
defines a region in orbital element space that is guaranteed to be Hill stable,
although Hill stable orbits may lie outside the region as well. No analytic
criteria describe Lagrange stability. We compare the results of 1000 numerical
simulations of planetary systems similar to 47 UMa and HD 12661 with these two
types of boundaries. All cases are consistent with the analytic criterion for
Hill stability. Moreover, the numerically determined Lagrange boundary lies
close to the analytic boundary for Hill stability. This result suggests an
analytic formulation that may describe the criterion for Lagrange stability.",2006-07-11T00:16:11Z
Transplanckian signatures in WMAP3?,"In this note we investigate how a possible signal in the WMAP3 data of rapid
oscillations in the primordial spectrum can be accommodated into an effective
model of transplanckian physics including back reaction. The results, if due to
a real effect, would indicate the presence of a low fundamental scale --
possibly the string scale -- around $2.2\cdot10^{-5}M_{pl}$.",2006-06-20T09:58:20Z
Accretion-powered Millisecond Pulsar Outbursts,"The population of accretion-powered millisecond pulsars has grown rapidly
over the last four years, with the discovery of six new examples to bring the
total sample to seven. While the first six discovered are transients active for
a few weeks every two or more years, the most recently-discovered source HETE
J1900.1-2455, has been active for more than 8 months. We summarise the
transient behaviour of the population to estimate long-term time-averaged
fluxes, and equate these fluxes to the expected mass transfer rate driven by
gravitational radiation in order to constrain the distances. We also estimate
an upper limit of 6 kpc to the distance of IGR J00291+5934 based on the
non-detection of bursts from this source.",2006-04-17T02:14:50Z
Remarkable non-dipolar magnetic field of the Bp star HD 137509,"The southern magnetic Bp star HD 137509 exhibits complex rotational
modulation of the longitudinal field and other magnetic observables.
Interpretation of this magnetic variability in the framework of the low-order
multipolar field models suggests a very strong quadrupolar component to
dominate the surface field topology of HD 137509. I have examined the
high-quality VLT/UVES spectra of HD 137509 and discovered resolved Zeeman split
components in some of the spectral lines. The inferred mean surface field
modulus, <B>=29 kG, agrees with the multipolar model predictions. This confirms
the presence of an extremely strong non-dipolar magnetic field in HD 137509 and
establishes this star as the object with the second-largest field among
magnetic chemically peculiar stars.",2006-03-30T20:21:44Z
On the one loop corrections to inflation and the CMB anisotropies,"We investigate the one loop effective potential of inflation in a standard
model of chaotic inflation. The leading one loop corrections to the effective
inflaton potential are evaluated in the quasi de Sitter background, and we
estimate the one loop correction to the two-point function of the inflaton
perturbations in the Hartree approximation. In this approximation, the one loop
corrections depends on the total number of e-foldings of inflation and the
maximal effect is estimated to be a correction to the power spectrum of a few
percent. However, such a correction may be difficult to disentangle from the
background in the simplest scenario.",2006-04-24T04:58:56Z
"CaII and DLA absorption line systems: dust, metals and star formation at
  0.4<z<1.3","Absorption line studies of galaxies along the line-of-sight to distant
quasars allow a direct observational link between the properties of the
extended gaseous disk/halo and of the star forming region of galaxies. In these
proceedings we review recent work on CaII absorbers detected in the SDSS at
0.4<z<1.3 which, because of their dust content and chemical properties, may lie
spatially closer to the central host galaxy than most DLAs. We present direct
evidence for the presence of star formation, through observation of the
[OII]3727,3730 emission line, in both CaII absorbers and MgII-selected Damped
Lyman-alpha (DLA) systems. The measured star formation rate (SFR) from light
falling within the SDSS fibre apertures (corresponding to physical radii of 6-9
h^{-1}kpc) is 0.11-0.48 Msol/yr for the CaII-absorbers and 0.11-0.14 Msol/yr
for the MgII-selected DLAs. The contribution of both CaII absorbers and DLAs to
the total observed SFR density, in the redshift range 0.4 < z < 1.3, is small,
<10%. Our result contrasts with recent conclusions, based on the Schmidt law,
that DLA absorbers can account for the majority of the total observed SFR
density in the same redshift range.",2006-07-21T16:02:14Z
Are peculiar Wolf-Rayet Stars of type WN8 Thorne-Zytkow Objects?,"Most population I Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are the He-rich descendants of the
most massive stars (M_i = 25 - 100 M_sun). Evidence has been accumulating over
the years that among all pop I WR stars, those of the relatively cool, N-rich
subtype ""WN8"" are among the most peculiar: 1. They tend to be runaways, with
large space velocity and/or avoid clusters. 2. Unlike their equally luminous
WN6,7 cousins, only a very small number of WN8 stars are known to belong to a
close binary with an OB companion. 3. They are the systematically most highly
stochastically variable among all (single) WR stars. Taken together, these
suggest that many WN8 stars may originally have been in close binaries (like
half of all stars), in which the original primary exploded as a supernova,
leaving behind a very close binary containing a massive star with a neutron
star/black hole companion (like Cyg X-3). When the massive remaining star
evolved in turn, it engulfed and eventually swallowed the compact companion,
leading to the presently puffed-up, variable WN8 star. Such stars could fall in
the realm of the exotic Thorne-Zytkow objects.",2006-07-11T08:34:56Z
Active Galactic Nuclei at the Crossroads of Astrophysics,"Over the last five decades, AGN studies have produced a number of spectacular
examples of synergies and multifaceted approaches in astrophysics. The field of
AGN research now spans the entire spectral range and covers more than twelve
orders of magnitude in the spatial and temporal domains. The next generation of
astrophysical facilities will open up new possibilities for AGN studies,
especially in the areas of high-resolution and high-fidelity imaging and
spectroscopy of nuclear regions in the X-ray, optical, and radio bands. These
studies will address in detail a number of critical issues in AGN research such
as processes in the immediate vicinity of supermassive black holes, physical
conditions of broad-line and narrow-line regions, formation and evolution of
accretion disks and relativistic outflows, and the connection between nuclear
activity and galaxy evolution.",2006-06-07T10:27:52Z
Analysis of White Dwarfs with Strange-Matter Cores,"We summarize masses and radii for a number of white dwarfs as deduced from a
combination of proper motion studies, Hipparcos parallax distances, effective
temperatures, and binary or spectroscopic masses. A puzzling feature of these
data is that some stars appear to have radii which are significantly smaller
than that expected for a standard electron-degenerate white-dwarf equations of
state. We construct a projection of white-dwarf radii for fixed effective mass
and conclude that there is at least marginal evidence for bimodality in the
radius distribution forwhite dwarfs. We argue that if such compact white dwarfs
exist it is unlikely that they contain an iron core. We propose an alternative
of strange-quark matter within the white-dwarf core. We also discuss the impact
of the so-called color-flavor locked (CFL) state in strange-matter core
associated with color superconductivity. We show that the data exhibit several
features consistent with the expected mass-radius relation of strange dwarfs.
We identify eight nearby white dwarfs which are possible candidates for strange
matter cores and suggest observational tests of this hypothesis.",2006-04-17T22:36:44Z
Baryonic loading and e^+e^- rate equation in GRB sources,"The expansion of the electron-positron plasma in the GRB phenomenon is
compared and contrasted in the treatments of Meszaros, Laguna and Rees, of
Shemi, Piran and Narayan, and of Ruffini et al. The role of the correct
numerical integration of the hydrodynamical equations, as well as of the rate
equation for the electron-positron plasma loaded with a baryonic mass, are
outlined and confronted for crucial differences.",2006-05-16T12:00:39Z
2-Dimensional Kinematics of Simulated Disc Merger Remnants,"We present a two-dimensional kinematic analysis for a sample of simulated
binary disc merger remnants with mass ratios 1:1 and 3:1. For the progenitor
discs we used pure stellar models as well as models with 10% of their mass in
gas. A multitude of phenomena also observed in real galaxies are found in the
simulations. These include misaligned rotation, embedded discs, gas rings,
counter-rotating cores and kinematic misaligned discs. Using the 2D maps we
illustrate projection effects and the change in properties of a merger remnant
when gas is included in the merger. We find that kinematic peculiar subsystems
are preferably formed in equal mass mergers. Equal-mass collisionless remnants
can show almost no rotation, regular rotation or strong kinematic misalignment.
The inclusion of gas makes the remnants appear more round(1:1) and
axisymmetric(3:1). Counter-Rotating Cores (CRCs) are almost exclusively formed
in equal-mass mergers with a dissipational component. 3:1 remnants show a much
more regular structure. We quantify these properties by applying the kinemetric
methods recently developed by Krajnovi\'c et al. This work will help to
understand observations of elliptical galaxies with 2D field spectrographs,
like SAURON.",2006-06-07T10:48:02Z
Making sky maps from Planck data,"We compare the performance of multiple codes written by different groups for
making polarized maps from Planck-sized, all-sky cosmic microwave background
(CMB) data. Three of the codes are based on a destriping algorithm; the other
three are implementations of an optimal maximum-likelihood algorithm.
Time-ordered data (TOD) were simulated using the Planck Level-S simulation
pipeline. Several cases of temperature-only data were run to test that the
codes could handle large datasets, and to explore effects such as the precision
of the pointing data. Based on these preliminary results, TOD were generated
for a set of four 217 GHz detectors (the minimum number required to produce I,
Q, and U maps) under two different scanning strategies, with and without noise.
Following correction of various problems revealed by the early simulation, all
codes were able to handle the large data volume that Planck will produce.
Differences in maps produced are small but noticeable; differences in computing
resources are large.",2006-06-14T17:11:57Z
"High Mass Star Formation. II. The Mass Function of Submillimeter Clumps
  in M17","We have mapped an approximately 5.5 by 5.5 pc portion of the M17 massive
star-forming region in both 850 and 450 micron dust continuum emission using
the Submillimeter Common-User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) on the James Clerk
Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). The maps reveal more than 100 dusty clumps with
deconvolved linear sizes of 0.05--0.2 pc and masses of 0.8--120 solar masses,
most of which are not associated with known mid-infrared point sources. Fitting
the clump mass function with a double power law gives a mean power law exponent
of alpha_high = -2.4 +/- 0.3 for the high-mass power law, consistent with the
exponent of the Salpeter stellar mass function. We show that a lognormal clump
mass distribution with a peak at about 4 solar masses produces as good a fit to
the clump mass function as does a double power law. This 4 solar mass peak mass
is well above the peak masses of both the stellar initial mass function and the
mass function of clumps in low-mass star-forming regions. Despite the
difference in intrinsic mass scale, the shape of the M17 clump mass function
appears to be consistent with the shape of the core mass function in low-mass
star-forming regions. Thus, we suggest that the clump mass function in
high-mass star-forming regions may be a scaled-up version of that in low-mass
regions, instead of its extension to higher masses.",2006-03-13T23:39:51Z
"Early and Late Transient Cosmic Acceleration due to Curvature Inspired
  Dark Energy","It is obtained that dark energy emerges from higher-derivative gravity with
anon-linear terms proportional to $R^2$ and $R^3$ with $R$ being the Ricci
scalar curvature. Interestingly, it is found that the universe begins with
acceleration, which continues for a short period. Later on,it decelerates
driven by radiation and subsequently by matter. Two components of dark energy
are found here.In the early universe, dark energy mimics quintessence giving
high vlue of initial density $\sim 10^{75} {\rm GeV}^4$ at Planck scale. But,
in the late universe, dark energy behaves like phantom giving current value of
its density and causing late acceleration for some time. Thereafter,
deceleration driven by matter resumes.Thus, two components of dark energy are
obtained here (i) quintessence-like in the early universe and (ii)phantom-like
in the late universe. Moreover, it is interesting to see acceleration being a
transient phenomenon in early as well as late universe.",2006-03-22T08:27:22Z
Mapping the ionizing sources with CMB polarization measurements,"We show that the delay of structure formation from WMAP3 can not fully
account for the reduction of electron optical depth from WMAP1 to WMAP3 when
the radiative transfer effects and feedback mechanisms are took into account in
computing the reionization history of the Universe. As the ultimate limit in
constraining the reionizatin history of the Universe with Planck will be placed
by the our understanding of systematic effects and foregrounds removal, we
discuss also these aspects.",2006-05-20T10:28:57Z
The chemical evolution of the Milky Way: from light to heavy elements,"We present results for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way including

Spectral line variability amplitudes in AGNs,"We present the results of a long-term variability campaign of very broad-line
AGNs with line widths broader than FWHM $>$ 5000 kms$^{-1}$. The main goal of
our investigation was to study whether the widths of the optical broad emission
lines are correlated with the optical intensity variations on timescales of
years. Our AGN sample consisted of 10 objects. We detected a significant
correlation between optical continuum variability amplitudes and H$\beta$
emission line widths (FWHM) and, to a lesser degree, between H$\beta$ line
intensity variations and H$\beta$ equivalent widths. We add the spectroscopic
data of variable AGNs from the literature to supplement our sample. The AGNs
from other optical variability campaigns with different line-widths helped to
improve the statistical significance of our very broad-line AGN sample. After
including the data on 35 additional galaxies, the correlation between optical
continuum variability amplitudes and H$\beta$ emission line widths becomes even
more significant and the probability that this is a random correlation drops to
0.7 percent.",2006-04-21T15:46:35Z
"Acoustic oscillations in rapidly rotating polytropic stars I. Effects of
  the centrifugal distortion","A new non-perturbative method to compute accurate oscillation modes in
rapidly rotating stars is presented. In this paper, the effect of the
centrifugal force is fully taken into account while the Coriolis force is
neglected. This assumption is valid when the time scale of the oscillation is
much shorter than the inverse of the rotation rate and is expected to be
suitable for high radial order p-modes of $\delta$ Scuti stars. Axisymmetric
p-modes have been computed in uniformly rotating polytropic models of stars. In
the frequency and rotation range considered, we found that as rotation
increases (i) the asymptotic structure of the non-rotating frequency spectrum
is first destroyed then replaced by a new form of organization (ii) the mode
amplitude tends to concentrate near the equator (iii) differences with
perturbative methods become significant as soon as the rotation rate exceeds
about fifteen percent of the Keplerian limit. The implications for the
seismology of rapidly rotating stars are then discussed.",2006-04-13T17:25:01Z
"The Wide Field Imager Lyman-Alpha Search (WFILAS) for Galaxies at
  Redshift ~5.7: II. Survey Design and Sample Analysis","Context: Wide-field narrowband surveys are an efficient way of searching
large volumes of high-redshift space for distant galaxies.
  Aims: We describe the Wide Field Imager Lyman-Alpha Search (WFILAS) over 0.74
sq. degree for bright emission-line galaxies at z~5.7.
  Methods: WFILAS uses deep images taken with the Wide Field Imager (WFI) on
the ESO/MPI 2.2m telescope in three narrowband (70 A), one encompassing
intermediate band (220 A) and two broadband filters, B and R. We use the novel
technique of an encompassing intermediate band filter to exclude false
detections. Images taken with broadband B and R filters are used to remove low
redshift galaxies from our sample.
  Results: We present a sample of seven Lya emitting galaxy candidates, two of
which are spectroscopically confirmed. Compared to other surveys all our
candidates are bright, the results of this survey complements other narrowband
surveys at this redshift. Most of our candidates are in the regime of bright
luminosities, beyond the reach of less voluminous surveys. Adding our
candidates to those of another survey increases the derived luminosity density
by ~30%. We also find potential clustering in the Chandra Deep Field South,
supporting overdensities discovered by other surveys. Based on a FORS2/VLT
spectrum we additionally present the analysis of the second confirmed Lya
emitting galaxy in our sample. We find that it is the brightest Lya emitting
galaxy (1 x 10^-16 erg s^-1 cm^-2) at this redshift to date and the second
confirmed candidate of our survey. Both objects exhibit the presence of a
possible second Lya component redward of the line.",2006-05-01T00:21:15Z
"An empirical tool to derive metallicity, reddening and distance for old
  stellar populations from near IR Color Magnitude Diagrams","We present an empirical method to derive photometric metallicity, reddening
and distance to old stellar populations by using a few major features of the
Red Giant Branch (RGB) in near IR color magnitude diagrams. We combine the
observed RGB features with a set of equations linking the global metallicity
[M/H] to suitable RGB parameters (colors, magnitudes and slope), as calibrated
from a homogeneous sample of Galactic Globular Clusters with different
metallicities. This technique can be applied to efficiently derive the main
population parameters of old stellar systems, in the view of using ground-based
adaptive optics and space facilities to probe the stellar content of remote
galaxies.",2006-05-19T11:41:11Z
On the formation of H-alpha line emission around classical T Tauri stars,"We present radiative transfer models of the circumstellar environment of
classical T Tauri stars, concentrating on the formation of the H-alpha
emission. The wide variety of line profiles seen in observations are indicative
of both inflow and outflow, and we therefore employ a circumstellar structure
that includes both magnetospheric accretion and a disc wind. We perform
systematic investigations of the model parameters for the wind and the
magnetosphere to search for possible geometrical and physical conditions which
lead to the types of profiles seen in observations. We find that the hybrid
models can reproduce the wide range of profile types seen in observations, and
that the most common profile types observed occupy a large volume of parameter
space. Conversely, the most infrequently observed profile morphologies require
a very specific set of models parameters. We find our model profiles are
consistent with the canonical value of the mass-loss rate to mass-accretion
rate ratio (mu=0.1) found in earlier magneto-hydrodynamic calculations and
observations, but the models with 0.05<mu<0.2 are still in accord with observed
H-alpha profiles. We investigate the wind contribution to the line profile as a
function of model parameters, and examine the reliability of H-alpha as a mass
accretion diagnostic. Finally, we examine the H-alpha spectroscopic
classification used by Reipurth et. al, and discuss the basic physical
conditions that are required to reproduce the profiles in each classified type.",2006-05-09T14:11:36Z
"Supernova Remnants in the Magellanic Clouds. VII. Infrared Emission from
  SNRs","We have used the instruments on the Spitzer Space Telescope to study the
Large Magellanic Cloud supernova remnants (SNRs) N11L, N44, N49, N206, N63A,
and N157B. The two large SNRs N44 and N206 were not detected in any IRAC or
MIPS wavebands; the remainder were detected at one or more wavelengths. In
particular, the SNRs N49 and N63A each had features that were evident in all
available IRAC and MIPS bands. Each of these two also displayed faint limb
emission in the MIPS 24 micron band only. IRS spectra obtained for the N49 SNR
showed a number of prominent lines, with little continuum contribution. We
therefore suggest that N49, and possibly N63A, are dominated by line emission,
with thermal emission from hot dust being at most a secondary component.",2006-07-26T17:30:44Z
Lyman Limit Systems in Cosmological Simulations,"We used cosmological simulation with self-consistent radiative transfer to
investigate the physical nature of Lyman Limit systems at z=4. In agreement
with previous studies, we find that most of Lyman Limit systems are ionized by
the cosmological background, while higher column density systems seem to be
illuminated by the local sources of radiation. In addition, we find that most
of Lyman limit systems in our simulations are located within the virial radii
of galaxies with a wide range of masses, and are physically associated with
them (``bits and pieces'' of galaxy formation). While the finite resolution of
our simulations cannot exclude an existence of a second population of
self-shielded, neutral gas clouds located in low mass dark matter halos
(``minihalos''), our simulations are not consistent with ``minihalos''
dominating the total abundance of Lyman limit systems.",2006-05-01T19:32:00Z
Variable iron-line emission near the black hole of Markarian 766,"We investigate the link between ionised Fe X-ray line emission and continuum
emission in the bright nearby AGN, Mrk 766. A new long (433 ks) XMM-Newton
observation is analysed, together with archival data from 2000 and 2001. The
contribution from ionised line emission is measured and its time variations on
short (5-20 ks) timescales are correlated with the continuum emission. The
ionised line flux is found to be highly variable and to be strongly correlated
with the continuum flux, demonstrating an origin for the ionised line emission
that is co-located with the continuum emission. Most likely the emission is
ionised reflection from the accretion disc within a few A.U. of the central
black hole, and its detection marks the first time that such an origin has been
identified other than by fitting to spectral line profiles. Future observations
may be able to measure a time lag and hence achieve reverberation mapping of
AGN at X-ray energies.",2006-05-04T17:37:36Z
Dwarf galaxies in the Antlia Cluster: First results,"We present the first results of a project aimed to study the galaxy
population of the Antlia cluster, the third nearest galaxy cluster after Virgo
and Fornax. The observations for the Antlia project consist of Washington
wide-field images taken with the MOSAIC camera mounted at the prime focus of
the CTIO 4-m Blanco telescope. Our preliminary results correspond to the
identification and classification of dwarf galaxies in the central cluster
region, extending the list of Ferguson & Sandage (1990). The final aim of our
project is to study the luminosity function, morphology and structural
parameters of dwarf galaxies in the Antlia cluster with a more complete sample.",2006-03-15T14:24:21Z
Redshifted 21 Centimeter Emission from Minihalos Before Reionization,"Before reionization, the intergalactic medium (IGM) may have been
sufficiently cold for low-mass ""minihalos"" to condense out of the gas and
subsequently affect reionization. Previous work has shown that minihalos
generate reasonably large 21 cm fluctuations. Here we consider this signal in
its proper cosmological context and show that isolating minihalos from the rest
of the IGM is extremely difficult. Using the well-known halo model, we compute
the power spectrum of 21 cm fluctuations from minihalos and show that the
signal decreases rapidly as feedback increases the Jeans mass. We then show
that even a small Lyman-alpha background increases the 21 cm fluctuations of
the diffuse IGM well beyond those of the minihalos; because the mass fraction
in the IGM is much larger, minihalos will lie buried within the IGM signal. The
distinctive signatures of non-linear bias and minihalo structure emerge only at
much smaller scales, well beyond the resolution of any upcoming instruments.
Using simple, but representative, reionization histories, we then show that the
required Lyman-alpha background level is most likely achieved at z>15, while
minihalos are still rare, so that they are almost always degenerate with the
diffuse IGM.",2006-04-04T20:24:57Z
UCDs - a mixed bag of objects,"The name ""Ultra-Compact Dwarf Galaxy"" (UCD) was invented for a new type of
astronomical object that has been discovered in cores of nearby galaxy clusters
a decade ago. UCDs resemble globular clusters, but are up to 100 times more
massive and slightly more extended. Their luminosities are comparable to those
of nuclei of the most massive dwarf ellipticals or late-type spirals. Various
formation scenarios have been brought forward to explain the origin and
evolution of UCDs. Two of them seem to be most promising: first, UCDs might be
the remnant nuclei of galaxies that have been disrupted in the cluster
environment. Second, UCDs might have formed from the agglomeration of many
young, massive star clusters that were created during ancient merger events. In
this contribution, I review the discovery history of UCDs, summarize their
observational properties in the fundamental plane of stellar systems and
discuss the implications for the different formation scenarios based on our
current knowledge about these enigmatic objects.",2006-05-18T10:03:07Z
Ellipsoidal Universe Can Solve The CMB Quadrupole Problem,"The recent three-year WMAP data have confirmed the anomaly concerning the low
quadrupole amplitude compared to the best-fit \Lambda CDM prediction. We show
that, allowing the large-scale spatial geometry of our universe to be
plane-symmetric with eccentricity at decoupling or order 10^{-2}, the
quadrupole amplitude can be drastically reduced without affecting higher
multipoles of the angular power spectrum of the temperature anisotropy.",2006-06-12T15:23:45Z
"New perspectives on strong z=0.5 MgII absorbers: are halo-mass and
  equivalent width anti-correlated?","We measure the mean halo-mass of z=0.5 MgII absorbers using the
cross-correlation (over co-moving scales 0.05-13h^{-1}Mpc) between 1806 MgII
quasar absorption systems and ~250,000 Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs), both
selected from the SDSS DR3. The MgII systems have rest-frame equivalent widths
W_r(2796)>=0.3A. From the ratio of the MgII-LRG cross-correlation to the
LRG-LRG auto-correlation, we find that the bias ratio between MgII absorbers
and LRGs is 0.65+/-0.08, which implies that the absorber host-galaxies have a
mean halo-mass 20-40 times smaller than that of the LRGs; the MgII absorbers
have halos of mean mass <logM_h(M_sol)>=11.94+/-0.31(stat)+/-0.25(sys). We
demonstrate that this statistical technique, which does not require any
spectroscopic follow-up, does not suffer from contaminants such as stars or
foreground and background galaxies. Finally, we find that the absorber
halo-mass is anti-correlated with the equivalent width. If MgII absorbers were
virialized in galaxy halos a positive M_h-W_r correlation would have been
observed since W_r(2796) is a direct measure of the velocity spread of the MgII
sub-components. Thus, our results demonstrate that the individual clouds of a
MgII system are not virialized in the gaseous halos of the host-galaxies. We
review past results in the literature on the statistics of MgII absorbers and
find that they too require an M_h-W_r anti-correlation. When combined with
measurements of the equivalent width distribution, the M_h-W_r anti-correlation
naturally explains why absorbers with W_r(2796)>=2A are not seen at large
impact parameters. We interpret the M_h-W_r anti-correlation within the
starburst scenario where strong MgII absorbers are produced by
supernovae-driven winds.",2006-06-13T20:00:19Z
NGC922 - A new drop-through ring galaxy,"We have found the peculiar galaxy NGC922 to be a new drop-through ring galaxy
using multi-wavelength (UV-radio) imaging and spectroscopic observations. Its
`C'-shaped morphology and tidal plume indicate a recent strong interaction with
its companion which was identified with these observations. Using numerical
simulations we demonstrate that the main properties of the system can be
generated by a high-speed off-axis drop-through collision of a small galaxy
with a larger disk system, thus making NGC922 one of the nearest known
collisional ring galaxies. While these systems are rare in the local Universe,
recent deep HST images suggest they were more common in the early Universe.",2006-05-24T06:24:05Z
"Simulations of Galactic Cosmic Rays Impacts on the Herschel/PACS
  Photoconductor Arrays with Geant4 Code","We present results of simulations performed with the Geant4 software code of
the effects of Galactic Cosmic Ray impacts on the photoconductor arrays of the
PACS instrument. This instrument is part of the ESA-Herschel payload, which
will be launched in late 2007 and will operate at the Lagrangian L2 point of
the Sun-Earth system. Both the Satellite plus the cryostat (the shield) and the
detector act as source of secondary events, affecting the detector performance.
Secondary event rates originated within the detector and from the shield are of
comparable intensity. The impacts deposit energy on each photoconductor pixel
but do not affect the behaviour of nearby pixels. These latter are hit with a
probability always lower than 7%. The energy deposited produces a spike which
can be hundreds times larger than the noise. We then compare our simulations
with proton irradiation tests carried out for one of the detector modules and
follow the detector behaviour under 'real' conditions.",2006-06-29T11:57:26Z
Study of Photon Dominated Regions in Cepheus B,"Aim: The aim of the paper is to understand the emission from the photon
dominated regions in Cepheus B, estimate the column densities of neutral carbon
in bulk of the gas in Cepheus B and to derive constraints on the factors which
determine the abundance of neutral carbon relative to CO. Methods: This paper
presents 15'x15' fully sampled maps of CI at 492 GHz and 12CO 4-3 observed with
KOSMA at 1' resolution. The new observations have been combined with the FCRAO
12CO 1-0, IRAM-30m 13CO 2-1 and C18O 1-0 data, and far-infrared continuum data
from HIRES/IRAS. The KOSMA-tau spherical PDR model has been used to understand
the CI and CO emission from the PDRs in Cepheus B and to explain the observed
variation of the relative abundances of both C^0 and CO. Results: The emission
from the PDR associated with Cepheus B is primarily at V_LSR between -14 and
-11 km s^-1. We estimate about 23% of the observed CII emission from the
molecular hotspot is due to the ionized gas in the HII region. Over bulk of the
material the C^0 column density does not change significantly, (2.0+-1.4)x10^17
cm^-2, although the CO column density changes by an order of magnitude. The
observed \cbyco abundance ratio varies between 0.06 and 4 in Cepheus B. We find
an anti-correlation of the observed C/CO abundance ratio with the observed
hydrogen column density, which holds even when all previous observations
providing C/CO ratios are included. Here we show that this observed variation
of C/CO abundance with total column density can be explained only by clumpy
PDRs consisting of an ensemble of clumps. At high H2 column densities high mass
clumps, which exhibit low C/CO abundance, dominate, while at low column
densities, low mass clumps with high C/CO abundance dominate.",2006-06-12T17:19:11Z

Discovery of a new high redshift QSO at z=5.96 with the Subaru telescope,"We report a discovery of a new high redshift quasar at $z=5.96$, observed
with the FOCAS long-slit spectrograph on board the Subaru telescope. The
spectrum shows strong and broad Ly$\alpha$+NV emission lines with a sharp
discontinuity to the blue side. A Ly$\beta$+OVI emission line is also detected,
providing a consistent redshift measurement with the Ly$\alpha$+NV emission.
The QSO has an absolute magnitude of $M_{AB,1450}=-26.9$ ($H_{0}=50$km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$, $q_0=0.5$).
  The spectrum shows significant flux in the region 8000-8300 $\AA$ and thus
does not show a complete Gunn-Peterson trough in the redshift range 5.58 to
5.82, along the line of sight to this $z=5.96$

"Extremely alpha-Enriched Globular Clusters in Early-Type Galaxies: A
  Step towards the Dawn of Stellar Populations?","We compare [alpha/Fe], metallicity, and age distributions of globular
clusters in elliptical, lenticular, and spiral galaxies, which we derive from
Lick line index measurements. We find a large number of globular clusters in
elliptical galaxies that reach significantly higher [alpha/Fe] values (>0.5)
than any clusters in lenticular and spiral galaxies. Most of these extremely
alpha-enriched globular clusters are old (t > 8 Gyr) and cover the metallicity
range -1 <~ [Z/H] <~ 0. A comparison with supernova yield models suggests that
the progenitor gas clouds of these globular clusters must have been
predominantly enriched by massive stars (>~20 M_sol) with little contribution
from lower-mass stars. The measured [alpha/Fe] ratios are also consistent with
yields of very massive pair-instability supernovae (~130-190 M_sol). Both
scenarios imply that the chemical enrichment of the progenitor gas was
completed on extremely short timescales of the order of a few Myr. Given the
lower [alpha/Fe] average ratios of the diffuse stellar population in early-type
galaxies, our results suggest that these extremely alpha-enhanced globular
clusters could be members of the very first generation of star clusters formed,
and that their formation epochs would predate the formation of the majority of
stars in giant early-type galaxies.",2006-05-09T18:21:04Z

  Nebula BD+303639","BD+303639, the brightest planetary nebula at X-ray energies, was observed
with Suzaku, an X-ray observatory launched on 2005 July 10. Using the X-ray
Imaging Spectrometer, the K-lines from C VI, O VII, and O VIII were resolved
for the first time, and C/O, N/O, and Ne/O abundance ratios determined. The C/O
and Ne/O abundance ratios exceed the solar value by a factor of at least 30 and
5, respectively. These results indicate that the X-rays are emitted mainly by
helium shell-burning products.",2006-07-07T17:17:07Z
The First Jet in the Universe: Protostellar Jets from the First Stars,"The protostellar jets driven by the formation of the first stars are studied
by using MHD nested grid simulations. Starting from a slowly rotating spherical
cloud of 5.1 times 10^4 Msun permeated by a uniform magnetic field, we follow
the evolution from the central number density n = 10^3 cm^-3 to n simeq 10^23
cm^-3. We calculate four models that differ in initial magnetic field strengths
and angular velocities. In all models, protostars of simeq 10^-3 Msun are
formed at n simeq 10^22 cm^-3 in accordance with one-dimensional calculations.
By this epoch, the magnetic flux density is amplified by 10 orders of magnitude
from the initial value. Consequently, the formed protostar possesses the
magnetic field of \sim 10^6 G that is much larger than the flux density of the
present counterparts, reflecting the fact that the dissipation of a magnetic
field is ineffective in primordial gas clouds. If the initial magnetic field B
> 10^-9 (n/10^3 cm^-3)^2/3 G, the protostellar jet is launched and its
velocities reaches \sim 70 km s^-1 by the time the protostellar mass becomes
(4-6) times 10^-3 Msun, and a fraction (3-10%) of the accreting matter is blown
off from the central region. Owing to the interaction of these ejecta with
surrounding matter, expanding bow shocks are created at both heads of the jet.
If this jet continues to sweep out the surrounding gas that otherwise accretes
onto the central star or circumstellar disk, the final mass of the first star
can be substantially reduced. In addition, dense post-shock regions behind the
bow shocks are expected to promote the chemical reactions (formation of H_2 and
HD), and this provides possible environments for subsequent low-mass star
formation in the early universe.",2006-05-05T02:18:50Z
Star formation through gravitational collapse and competitive accretion,"Competitive accretion, a process to explain the origin of the IMF, occurs
when stars in a common gravitational potential accrete from a distributed
gaseous component. We show that concerns recently raised on the efficiency of
competitive accretion are incorrect as they use globally averaged properties
which are inappropriate for the detailed physics of a forming stellar cluster.
A full treatment requires a realistic treatment of the cluster potential, the
distribution of turbulent velocities and gas densities. Accreting gas does not
travel at the global virial velocity of the system due to the
velocity-sizescale relation inherent in turbulent gas and due to the lower
velocity dispersion of small-N clusters in which much of the accretion occurs.
Stars located in the gas-rich centres of such systems initially accrete from
low relative velocity gas attaining larger masses before needing to accrete the
higher velocity gas. Stars not in the centres of such potentials, or that enter
the cluster later when the velocity dispersion is higher, do not accrete
significantly and thus retain their low-masses. In competitive accretion, most
stars do not continue to accrete significantly such that their masses are set
from the fragmentation process. It is the few stars which continue to accrete
that become higher-mass stars. Competitive accretion is therefore likely to be
responsible for the formation of higher-mass stars and can explain the mass
distribution, mass segregation and binary frequency of these stars. Global
kinematics of competitive accretion models include large-scale mass infall,
with mean inflow velocities of order 0.5 km/s at scales of 0.5 pc, but infall
signatures are likely to be confused by the large tangential velocities and the
velocity dispersion present.",2006-04-28T16:41:38Z
Mosaicking with cosmic microwave background interferometers,"Measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies by
interferometers offer several advantages over single-dish observations. The
formalism for analyzing interferometer CMB data is well developed in the
flat-sky approximation, valid for small fields of view. As the area of sky is
increased to obtain finer spectral resolution, this approximation needs to be
relaxed. We extend the formalism for CMB interferometry, including both
temperature and polarization, to mosaics of observations covering arbitrarily
large areas of the sky, with each individual pointing lying within the flat-sky
approximation. We present a method for computing the correlation between
visibilities with arbitrary pointing centers and baselines and illustrate the
effects of sky curvature on the l-space resolution that can be obtained from a
mosaic.",2006-06-19T16:45:27Z
Galaxy Galaxy Lensing as a Probe of Galaxy Dark Matter Halos,"Gravitational lensing has now become a popular tool to measure the mass
distribution of structures in the Universe on various scales. Here we focus on
the study of galaxy's scale dark matter halos with galaxy-galaxy lensing
techniques: observing the shapes of distant background galaxies which have been
lensed by foreground galaxies allows us to map the mass distribution of the
foreground galaxies. The lensing effect is small compared to the intrinsic
ellipticity distribution of galaxies, thus a statistical approach is needed to
derive some constraints on an average lens population. An advantage of this
method is that it provides a probe of the gravitational potential of the halos
of galaxies out to very large radii, where few classical methods are viable,
since dynamical and hydrodynamical tracers of the potential cannot be found at
this radii. We will begin by reviewing the detections of galaxy-galaxy lensing
obtained so far. Next we will present a maximum likelihood analysis of
simulated data we performed to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of
constraints that can be obtained on galaxy halo properties. Then we will apply
this method to study the properties of galaxies which stand in massive cluster
lenses at z~0.2. The main result of this work is to find dark matter halos of
cluster galaxies to be significantly more compact compared to dark matter halos
around field galaxies of equivalent luminosity, in agreement with early
galaxy-galaxy lensing studies and with theoretical expectations, in particular
with the tidal stripping scenario. We thus provide a strong confirmation of
tidal truncation from a homogeneous sample of galaxy clusters. Moreover, it is
the first time that cluster galaxies are probed successfully using
galaxy-galaxy lensing techniques from ground based data.",2006-06-19T13:59:44Z
"Shock-Wave Heating Model for Chondrule Formation: Prevention of Isotopic
  Fractionation","Chondrules are considered to have much information on dust particles and
processes in the solar nebula. It is naturally expected that protoplanetary
disks observed in present star forming regions have similar dust particles and
processes, so study of chondrule formation may provide us great information on
the formation of the planetary systems.
  Evaporation during chondrule melting may have resulted in depletion of
volatile elements in chondrules. However, no evidence for a large degree of
heavy-isotope enrichment has been reported in chondrules. In order to meet this
observed constraint, the rapid heating rate at temperatures below the silicate
solidus is required to suppress the isotopic fractionation.
  We have developed a new shock-wave heating model taking into account the
radiative transfer of the dust thermal continuum emission and the line emission
of gas molecules and calculated the thermal history of chondrules. We have
found that optically-thin shock waves for the thermal continuum emission from
dust particles can meet the rapid heating constraint, because the dust thermal
emission does not keep the dust particles high temperature for a long time in
the pre-shock region and dust particles are abruptly heated by the gas drag
heating in the post-shock region. We have also derived the upper limit of
optical depth of the pre-shock region using the radiative diffusion
approximation, above which the rapid heating constraint is not satisfied. It is
about 1 - 10.",2006-07-03T07:22:32Z
Dust in starburst nuclei and ULIRGs: SED models for observers,"We provide a library of some 7000 SEDs (available at www.eso.org/~rsiebenm)
for the nuclei of starburst and ultra luminous galaxies. Its purpose is to
quickly obtain estimates of the basic parameters, such as luminosity, size and
dust or gas mass and to predict the flux at yet unobserved wavelengths. The
procedure is simple and consists of finding an element in the library that
matches the observations. The objects may be in the local universe or at high
z.
  We calculate the radiative transfer in spherical symmetry for a stellar
cluster permeated by an interstellar medium with standard (Milky Way) dust
properties. The cluster contains two stellar populations: old bulge stars and
OB stars. Because the latter are young, a certain fraction of them will be
embedded in compact clouds which constitute hot spots that determine the MIR
fluxes.
  We present SEDs for a broad range of luminosities, sizes and obscurations. We
argue that the assumption of spherical symmetry and the neglect of clumpiness
of the medium are not severe shortcomings for computing the dust emission. The
validity of the approach is demonstrated by matching the SED of seven of the
best studied galaxies, including M82 and Arp220, by library elements. In all
cases, one finds an element which fits the observed SED very well, and the
parameters defining the element are in full accord with what is known about the
galaxy from detailed studies. We also compare our method of computing SEDs with
other techniques described in the literature.",2006-06-19T12:39:56Z
XRF 050406 late-time flattening: an inverse Compton component?,"We investigate for possible evidence of inverse Compton (IC) emission in the

we show how the late-time flattening observed in the X-ray light curve between
\~10^{4} s and ~10^{6} s can be explained in a synchrotron-plus-IC scenario,
when the IC peak frequency crosses the X-ray band. We thus conclude that the
appearance of an IC component above the synchrotron one at late times
successfully accounts for these X-ray observations.",2006-04-07T13:55:50Z
"New light on the old problem of lithium pre--MS depletion: models with
  2D RHD convection","The Teff location of Pre-Main Sequence (PMS) evolutionary tracks depends on
the treatment of over-adiabaticity. We present here the PMS evolutionary tracks
computed by using the mixing length theory of convection (MLT) in which the
alpha_MLT=l/H_p parameter calibration is based on 2D--hydrodynamical models
(Ludwig et al. 1999). These MLT--\alpha^2D stellar models and tracks are very
similar to those computed with non--grey ATLAS9 atmospheric boundary conditions
and Full Spectrum of Turbulence (FST) convection model both in the atmosphere
and in the interior. The comparison of the new tracks with the location on the
HR diagram of pre--MS binariesis not completely satisfactory, as some binary
components are located at too low \teff. Besides, the pre--MS lithium depletion
in the MLT--\alpha^2D tracks is still much larger than that expected from the
observations of lithium in young open clusters. This result is similar to that
of FST models. Thus, in spite of the fact that 2D RHD models should provide a
better convection description than any local model, their introduction is not
sufficient to reconcile theory and observations. Lithium depletion in young
clusters points towards a convection efficiency which, in pre--MS, should be
smaller than in the MS. The pre--MS lithium depletion decreases significantly
in FST models if we reduce the solar metallicity down to the value suggested by
Asplund et al.(2004), but the corresponding solar model does not reproduce the
depth of the convective zone as determined by helioseismology.",2006-05-24T09:17:10Z
"The Impact of Starbursts and Post-Starbursts on the Photometric
  Evolution of High Redshift Galaxies","We present evolutionary synthesis models for galaxies of spectral types Sa
through Sd with starbursts of various strengths triggered at various redshifts
and study their photometric evolution before, during, and after their bursts in
a cosmological context. We find that bursts at high redshift, even very strong
ones, only cause a small blueing of their intrinsically blue young parent
galaxies. At lower redshift, even small bursts cause a significant blueing of
their intrinsically redder galaxies. While the burst phase is generally short,
typically a few hundred Myr in normal-mass galaxies, the postburst stage with
its red colors and, in particular the very red ones for early bursts at high
redshift, is much longer, of the order of several Gyr. Even without any dust,
which in the postburst stage is not expected to play an important role anyway,
models easily reach the colors of EROs in the redshift range z=2 through z=0.5
after starbursts at redshifts between 2 and 4. We therefore propose a third
alternative for the ERO galaxies beyond the two established ones of passive
galaxies vs. dusty starbursts: the dust-free post-(strong-)starbursts. A very
first comparison of our models to HDF data with photometric redshifts shows
that almost all of the outliers that could not be described with our chemically
consistent models for undisturbed normal galaxy types E through Sd can now be
explained very well. Galaxies in the redshift range from z=2.5 to z=0.5 that
are redder, and in some cases much redder, than our reddest undisturbed model
for a high-metallicity classical elliptical are well described by
post-starburst models after starbursts at redshifts between 2 and 4. Galaxies
bluer than our bluest low metallicity Sd model, most of which have redshifts
lower than 1, are well explained by ongoing starbursts.",2006-04-06T14:45:16Z
Optical spectroscopy of the dwarf nova U Geminorum,"U Gem is unique in having a direct measurement of K1 = 107 +- 2 km/s, Long et
al. 1999). We present high-resolution optical spectra of the dwarf nova U Gem
in quiescence taken to test the accuracy to which the HST value can be
recovered from optical data. We find that, even with data of very high S/N we
cannot recover Long et al.'s value to better than about 20% by any method.
Contamination by neighbouring emission lines seems a likely culprit. Our data
reveal a number of new features: Doppler tomograms show emission at low
velocity, close to the centre of mass, and a transient, narrow absorption
feature is seen in the Balmer lines near the line centres at the time of
eclipse. We suggest that stellar prominences, as previously invoked for the
dwarf novae IP Peg and SS Cyg in outburst, may explain both of these features.
The He II 4686.75 A line emission is dominated by the gas stream/disc impact
region. Two distinct spots are seen in Doppler maps, the first being very
narrow and showing a velocity close to that of the accretion disc in the impact
region, and the second much broader and located between the velocities of the
(ballistic) stream and the (Keplerian) disc. We present tentative evidence of
weak spiral structure. We find no evidence of stream-disc overflow in the
system. Our data suggests an inclination angle > 70 degrees, adding to the
evidence of a puzzle in the mass of U Gem's white dwarf. The mass donor is
clearly seen in the Doppler maps, with emission concentrated towards its poles,
and mainly on the side facing the white dwarf. This suggests irradiation with
shielding by the disc from which we estimate an H/R ratio between 0.15 and
0.25.",2006-04-18T22:22:43Z
Detection of a Variable Infrared Excess Around SDSS 121209.31+013627.7,"We present near-infrared $JHK_s$ photometry and light curves of the candidate
magnetic white dwarf+brown dwarf binary SDSS J121209.31+013627.7 and report on
the detection of near-infrared excess and variability in the $K_s-$band. The
observed near-infrared excess can be explained by the presence of an L7 brown
dwarf and an extra emission source. The $J$ and $H$ light curves appear flat,
which rules out eclipses deeper than 0.2 mag and the presence of an accretion
hot spot on the white dwarf. From the variable $K_s$ lightcurve, we get a
refined period for the system of 88$\pm$1 minutes. We show that the observed
variability in $K_s-$band can be explained by cyclotron emission, which can be
modeled by a small spot on the surface of the white dwarf. SDSS 1212 exhibits
similarities to the ultra-short period polar EF Eridani, however the lack of
evidence for Roche-lobe overflow accretion suggests it may be a pre-polar.",2006-07-07T20:45:10Z
Exploring brown dwarf disks: A 1.3 mm survey in Taurus,"We have carried out sensitive 1.3 mm observations of 20 young brown dwarfs in
the Taurus star-forming region, representing the largest sample of young
substellar objects targeted in a deep millimeter continuum survey to date.
Under standard assumptions, the masses of brown dwarf disks range from ~<0.4 to
several Jupiter masses. Their relative disk masses are comparable to those
derived for coeval low-mass stars: most of them are in the ~<1-5% range, and
there is no clear change of relative disk mass with object mass from 0.015 to 3
solar masses. Specifically, we do not find evidence for disk truncation, as
would be expected in the ejection scenario for brown dwarf origin, although the
signature of ejection may be hidden in our non-detections. We use the derived
mm fluxes, complemented by mid-infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope
and ground-based near-infrared images, to construct spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) for six of our sources, and model those SEDs with a Monte
Carlo radiative transfer code. While the model fits are by no means unique,
they allow us to investigate disk properties such as the degree of flaring and
minimum radii. In several cases, we find that the SEDs in the mid-infrared
exhibit lower flux levels than predicted by hydrostatic models, implying dust
settling to the disk midplane. What's more, at least 25% of our targets are
likely to have disks with radii >10 AU; models with smaller disks cannot
reproduce the mm fluxes even if they are very massive. This finding is in
contrast to the results of some simulations of the ejection scenario for brown
dwarf formation that suggest only ~5% of ejected objects would harbor disks
larger than 10 AU. Our findings imply that ejection is probably not the
dominant formation process, but may still be relevant for some brown dwarfs.",2006-03-22T21:02:55Z
Spectroscopic binaries with components of similar mass,"The assertion that there is an intrinsic excess of binaries with mass ratios
q \simeq 1 - the twin hypothesis - is investigated. A strong version of this
hypothesis (H_s), due to Lucy & Ricco (1979) and Tokovinin (2000), refers to a
narrow peak in the distribution function psi(q) for q \ga 0.95. A weak version
(H_w), due to Halbwachs et al. (2003), refers to a broad peak for q \ga 0.8.
Current data on SB2's is analysed and H_s is found to be statistically
significant for a sample restricted to orbits of high precision. But claims
that H_s is significant for binaries with special characteristics are not
confirmed since the sample sizes are well below the minimum required for a
reliable test. With regard to H_w, additional observational evidence is not
presented, but evidence to the contrary in the form of Hogeveen's (1992b) model
of biased sampling with psi \propto q^{-2} is criticized. Specifically, his
success in thus fitting catalogued data depends on implausible assumptions
about the research methodologies of binary-star spectroscopists.",2006-07-11T12:40:49Z
The recent star formation in NGC 6822 from HST imaging,"We present HST WFPC2 and STIS imaging of the low metallicity galaxy NGC 6822,
performed as part of a study of the young stellar populations in the galaxies
of the Local Group. Eleven WFPC2 pointings, with some overlap, cover two
regions, extending over 19'x19' and 13'x13' respectively, off the galaxy
center. One 25x25'' field observed with STIS' FUV- and NUV- MAMA, includes
Hodge's OB8 association and the HII region Hubble V. We derive the physical
parameters of the stars in the fields and the extinction by comparing the
photometry to grids of model magnitudes. The environments studied in this work
include one of the most luminous (in Halpha) HII regions in the Local Group
(Hubble V) with a compact star cluster, a typical OB association (OB15), the
sparse field population and the outskirts of NGC6822. The color-magnitude
diagrams show similar ages of few Myrs for both OB8 and OB15. The density [per
unit area] of hot massive stars in the core of the OB8 association is higher
than in OB15 by a factor of 12, while the total stellar mass formed is similar.
In both OB15 and OB8 massive star candidates are found. The average extinction
is found to vary among the three environments studied: E(B-V) = 0.22 in the
outer regions, E(B-V) = 0.27 in the fields East of the galaxy main bar, and
E(B-V) = 0.40 in the HII region Hubble V. A quantitative discussion of the
applicability of the reddening-free-index method for photometric determination
of stellar parameters is provided for the filters used in this work, based on
our grids of stellar models.",2006-05-14T21:27:39Z
"Integral Field Spectroscopy of the Extended Emission-Line Region of 3C
  249.1","We present Gemini Multiobject Spectrograph integral field spectroscopy of the
extended emission-line region associated with quasar 3C 249.1. The kinematics
of the ionized gas measured from the [O III] $\lambda$5007 line is rather
complex and cannot be explained globally by a simple dynamical model, but some
clouds can be modeled individually as having locally linear velocity gradients.
The temperatures of the ionized gas appear uniform (varying from ~12000 to
15000 K), while the densities vary from a few tens to a few hundreds cm^{-3}.
The emission mechanism of all of the emission clouds, as indicated by the
line-ratio diagnostics, is consistent both with ""shock + precursor"" and pure
photoionization models. The total mass of the ionized gas is on the order of
10^9 M_Sun. We estimate the bulk kinetic energy and momentum of the extended
emission-line region of 2.5*10^{57} ergs and 10^{50} dyne s, and a dynamical
timescale of ~10 Myr. By comparing the injection rates of kinetic energy and
momentum of different galactic wind models with the observation, we argue that
the emission-line clouds are most likely a direct result from the feedback of
the quasar. We also discuss the nature of the extended X-ray emission
surrounding the quasar.",2006-06-21T04:12:14Z
"CXOU J121538.2+361921 in the galaxy NGC 4214: a double neutron star in
  the making?","CXOU J121538.2+361921 is the brightest X-ray source in the galaxy NGC 4214,
with an X-ray luminosity of up to 0.7 x 10^39 erg/s. The observed periodicity
of 3.62 hr is interpreted as the orbital period of the system. It has been
suggested that the system is a low-mass helium star with a lower-mass compact
companion. If this idea is correct, then CXOU J121538.2+361921 will evolve into
a double neutron star, a binary consisting of a radio pulsar and another
neutron star. In this study we investigate further this possibility. We find
that the X-ray luminosity is consistent with super-Eddington accretion in a
helium star-neutron star binary. The binary is in a state of mass transfer
phase which is initiated when the helium-star donor is on the helium shell
burning stage. A donor star with a current mass in the range of around 2.2 -
3.6 Msun is required to explain the observed orbital period. Helium stars in
this mass range are massive enough to collapse in a supernova explosion, making
CXOU J121538.2+361921 the immediate progenitor of a double neutron star.",2006-07-05T11:44:35Z
Heavy Element Abundances in Giant Stars of 47 Tuc,"This research forms part of an investigation into heavy element abundances in
Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars in various stellar environments. Seven
giant stars in the southern globular cluster 47 Tuc have been observed using
the Anglo-Australian Telescope. Abundances for five s- and r- process elements
have been determined: the light s-process elements, Y and Zr; the heavy
s-process elements, La and Nd; and the r-process element Eu. Mean enhancements
in the light s-process, [ls/Fe], of ~+0.6 dex and heavy s-process elements,
[hs/Fe], of ~+0.3 dex were determined for all the giant stars. There was no
statistically significant difference between the abundances determined for the
Red Giant Branch (RGB) and AGB stars in this study. The results for the RGB
stars differ from those obtained by a number of previous studies. However,
because of the similar abundance results obtained for the AGB and RGB stars in
this study we believe this provides evidence for previous enrichment of the
material from which these stars formed.",2006-05-21T20:40:01Z
The role of project science in the Chandra X-ray Observatory,"The Chandra X-ray Observatory, one of NASA's Great Observatories, has an
outstanding record of scientific and technical success. This success results
from the efforts of a team comprising NASA, its contractors, the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory, the instrument groups, and other elements of the
scientific community -- including the thousands of scientists who utilize this
powerful facility for astrophysical research. We discuss the role of NASA
Project Science in the formulation, development, calibration, and operation of
the Chandra X-ray Observatory. In addition to serving as an interface between
the scientific community and the Project, Project Science performed what we
term ""science systems engineering"". This activity encompasses translation of
science requirements into technical requirements and assessment of the
scientific impact of programmatic and technical trades. We briefly describe
several examples of science systems engineering conducted by Chandra Project
Science.",2006-06-14T19:36:47Z
How accurate are the time delay estimates in gravitational lensing?,"We present a novel approach to estimate the time delay between light curves
of multiple images in a gravitationally lensed system, based on Kernel methods
in the context of machine learning. We perform various experiments with
artificially generated irregularly-sampled data sets to study the effect of the
various levels of noise and the presence of gaps of various size in the
monitoring data. We compare the performance of our method with various other
popular methods of estimating the time delay and conclude, from experiments
with artificial data, that our method is least vulnerable to missing data and
irregular sampling, within reasonable bounds of Gaussian noise. Thereafter, we
use our method to determine the time delays between the two images of quasar
Q0957+561 from radio monitoring data at 4 cm and 6 cm, and conclude that if
only the observations at epochs common to both wavelengths are used, the time
delay gives consistent estimates, which can be combined to yield 408\pm 12
days. The full 6 cm dataset, which covers a longer monitoring period, yields a
value which is 10% larger, but this can be attributed to differences in
sampling and missing data.",2006-05-01T20:42:03Z
"The Variability and Rotation of Pre-main Sequence Stars in IC 348: Does
  Intracluster Environment Influence Stellar Rotation?","A variability study of the young cluster IC 348 at Van Vleck Observatory has
been extended to a total of seven years. Twelve new periodic stars have been
found in the last two years, bringing the total discovered by this program to
40. In addition, we confirm 16 of the periods reported by others and resolve
some discrepancies. The total number of known rotation periods in the cluster,
from all studies has now reached 70. This is sufficient to demonstrate that the
parent population of K5-M2 stars is rotationally indistinguishable from that in
the Orion Nebula Cluster even though their radii are 20% smaller and they would
be expected to spin about twice as fast if angular momentum were conserved. The
median radius and, therefore, inferred age of the IC 348 stars actually closely
matches that of NGC 2264, but the stars spin significantly more slowly. This
suggests that another factor besides mass and age plays a role in establishing
the rotation properties within a cluster and we suggest that it is environment.
If disk locking were to persist for longer times in less harsh environments,
because the disks themselves persist for longer times, it could explain the
generally slower rotation rates observed for stars in this cluster, whose
earliest type star is of class B5. We have also obtained radial velocities, the
first for PMS stars in IC348, and v sin i measurements for 30 cluster stars to
assist in the study of rotation and as an independent check on stellar radii.
Several unusual variable stars are discussed; in some or all cases their
behavior may be linked to occultations by circumstellar material. A strong
correlation exists between the range of photometric variability and the slope
of the spectral energy distribution in the infrared. Nineteen of the 21 stars
with I ranges exceeding 0.4 mag show infrared evidence for circumstellar disks.",2006-06-18T13:31:09Z
"The Distance to the Galactic Center Derived From Infrared Photometry of
  Bulge Red Clump Stars","On the basis of the near infrared observations of bulge red clump stars near
the Galactic center, we have determined the galactocentric distance to be R_0 =
7.52 +- 0.10 (stat) +- 0.35 (sys) kpc. We observed the red clump stars at |l| <
1.0 deg and 0.7 deg < |b| < 1.0 deg with the IRSF 1.4 m telescope and the
SIRIUS camera in the H and Ks bands. After extinction and population
corrections, we obtained (m - M)_0 = 14.38 +- 0.03 (stat) +- 0.10 (sys). The
statistical error is dominated by the uncertainty of the intrinsic local red
clump stars' luminosity. The systematic error is estimated to be +- 0.10
including uncertainties in extinction and population correction, zero-point of
photometry, and the fitting of the luminosity function of the red clump stars.
Our result, R_0 = 7.52 kpc, is in excellent agreement with the distance
determined geometrically with the star orbiting the massive black hole in the
Galactic center. The recent result based on the spatial distribution of
globular clusters is also consistent with our result. In addition, our study
exhibits that the distance determination to the Galactic center with the red
clump stars, even if the error of the population correction is taken into
account, can achieve an uncertainty of about 5%, which is almost the same level
as that in recent geometrical determinations.",2006-07-18T10:09:12Z
The X-ray Halo of GX5-1,"Using Chandra observations we have measured the energy-resolved
dust-scattered X-ray halo around the low-mass X-ray binary GX5-1, which shows
signs of both singly- and multiply-scattered X-rays. We compared the observed
X-ray halo at various energies to predictions from a range of dust models.
These fits used both smoothly-distributed dust as well as dust in clumped
clouds, with CO and 21 cm observations helping to determine the position of the
clouds along the line of sight. We found that the BARE-GR-B model of Zubko,
Dwek & Arendt (2004 generally led to the best results, although inadequacies in
both the overall model and the data limit our conclusions. We also found that
the composite dust models of Zubko, Dwek & Arendt (2004), especially the ``no
carbon'' models, gave uniformly poor results. Although models using cloud
positions and densities derived naively from CO and 21 cm data gave generally
poor results, plausible adjustments to the distance of the largest cloud and
the mass of a cloud in the expanding 3 kpc Arm lead to significantly improved
fits. We suggest that combining X-ray halo, CO, and 21 cm observations will be
a fruitful method to improve our understanding of both the gas and dust phases
of the interstellar medium.",2006-05-08T15:48:01Z
"Cosmic Evolution of Black Holes and Spheroids. I: The M_BH-sigma
  Relation at z=0.36","We test the evolution of the correlation between black hole mass and bulge
velocity dispersion (M$_{\rm BH}-\sigma$), using a carefully selected sample of
14 Seyfert 1 galaxies at $z=0.36\pm0.01$. We measure velocity dispersion from
stellar absorption lines around Mgb (5175\AA) and Fe (5270\AA) using high S/N
Keck spectra, and estimate black hole mass from the H$\beta$ line width and the
optical luminosity at 5100\AA, based on the empirically calibrated
photo-ionization method. We find a significant offset from the local relation,
in the sense that velocity dispersions were smaller for given black hole masses
at $z=0.36$ than locally. We investigate various sources of systematic
uncertainties and find that those cannot account for the observed offset. The
measured offset is $\Delta \log M_{\rm BH}=0.62 \pm 0.10 \pm 0.25$, i.e.
$\Delta \log \sigma=0.15 \pm 0.03 \pm 0.06$, where the error bars include a
random component and an upper limit to the systematics. At face value, this
result implies a substantial growth of bulges in the last 4 Gyr, assuming that
the local M$_{\rm BH}-\sigma$ relation is the universal evolutionary end-point.
Along with two samples of active galaxies with consistently determined black
hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion taken from the literature, we
quantify the observed evolution with the best fit linear relation, $\Delta \log
M_{\rm BH} = (1.66\pm0.43)z + (0.04\pm0.09)$ with respect to the local
relationship of Tremaine et al. (2002), and $\Delta \log M_{\rm BH} =
(1.55\pm0.46)z + (0.01\pm0.12)$ with respect to that of Ferrarese (2002). This
result is consistent with the growth of black holes predating the final growth
of bulges at these mass scales ($<\sigma>$=170 km s$^{-1}$).",2006-03-23T21:59:05Z
The nature of the DLS fast transients,"The discovery and study of highly transient sources, especially those which
rise to high brightness and then fade to obscurity, has been a major part of
modern astrophysics. Well known examples include supernovae and novae. A
byproduct of the Deep Lens Survey was the discovery of three transients which
varied on a timescale of less than an hour. All three had faint and red
counterparts, the brightest of which was identified with an M star. However,
the remaining two showed hints of an extragalactic origin, one had a spatially
extended counterpart and the other appeared in projection on the outskirts of a
bright elliptical galaxy. If these two sources were really of an extragalactic
origin then the two events represent a new class of exotic explosive
transients. We undertook spectroscopic observations with the Keck telescope and
find the two counterparts are also late type Galactic dwarfs. Our main
conclusion is that flares from M dwarfs constitute a dense foreground fog and
dominate over any plausible class of extragalactic fast transients by at least
two orders of magnitude. Overcoming this fog will likely require dedicated
surveys with careful optimization of target field location, filter(s) and
cadence, pre-search imaging to filter out late type dwarfs and a well planned
rapid followup plan.",2006-04-16T18:30:35Z
"Feedback and metal enrichment in cosmological SPH simulations - II. A
  multiphase model with supernova energy feedback","We have developed a new scheme to treat a multiphase interstellar medium in
smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of galaxy formation. This scheme
can represent a co-spatial mixture of cold and hot ISM components, and is
formulated without scale-dependent parameters. It is thus particularly suited
to studies of cosmological structure formation where galaxies with a wide range
of masses form simultaneously. We also present new algorithms for energy and
heavy element injection by supernovae, and show that together these schemes can
reproduce several important observed effects in galaxy evolution. Both in
collapsing systems and in quiescent galaxies our codes can reproduce the
Kennicutt relation between the surface densities of gas and of star formation.
Strongly metal-enhanced winds are generated in both cases with ratios of
mass-loss to star formation which are similar to those observed. This leads to
a self-regulated cycle for star formation activity. The overall impact of
feedback depends on galaxy mass. Star formation is suppressed at most by a
factor of a few in massive galaxies, but in low-mass systems the effects can be
much larger, giving star formation an episodic, bursty character. The larger
the energy fraction assumed available in feedback, the more massive the
outflows and the lower the final stellar masses. Winds from forming disks are
collimated perpendicular to the disk plane, reach velocities up to 1000 km/s,
and efficiently transport metals out of the galaxies. The asymptotically
unbound baryon fraction drops from >95 per cent to ~30 per cent from the least
to the most massive of our idealised galaxies, but the fraction of all metals
ejected with this component exceeds 60 per cent regardless of mass. Such winds
could plausibly enrich the intergalactic medium to observed levels.",2006-04-25T17:20:54Z
Stellar Populations with ELTs,"The star formation, mass assembly and chemical enrichment histories of
galaxies, and their present distributions of dark matter, remain encoded in
their stellar populations. Distinguishing the actual distribution functions of
stellar age, metallicity and kinematics at several locations in a range of
galaxies, sampling across Hubble types and representative environments, is the
information required for a robust description of galaxy histories. Achieving
this requires large aperture, to provide the sensitivity to reach a range of
environs and Hubble types beyond the Local Group, to provide high spatial
resolution, since the fields are crowded, and preferably with optical
performance since age-sensitivity is greatest near the main-sequence turn-off,
and metallicity-sensitivity for these warm stars is greatest in the optical.",2006-04-06T11:45:25Z
FUSE observations of HD 5980: The wind structure of the eruptor,"HD 5980 is a unique system containing one massive star (star A) that is
apparently entering the luminous blue variable phase, and an eclipsing
companion (star B) that may have already evolved beyond this phase to become a
Wolf-Rayet star. In this paper we present the results from FUSE observations
obtained in 1999, 2000, and 2002 and one far-UV observation obtained by
ORFEUS/BEFS in 1993 shortly before the first eruption of HD 5980. The eight
phase-resolved spectra obtained by FUSE in 2002 are analyzed in the context of
a wind-eclipse model. This analysis shows that the wind of the eruptor obeyed a
very fast velocity law in 2002, which is consistent with the line-driving
mechanism. Large amplitude line-profile variations on the orbital period are
shown to be due to the eclipse of star B by the wind of star A, although the
eclipse due to gas flowing in the direction of star B is absent. This can only
be explained if the wind of star A is not spherically symmetric, or if the
eclipsed line radiation is ""filled-in"" by emission originating from somewhere
else in the system, e.g., in the wind-wind collision region. Except for a
slightly lower wind speed, the ORFEUS/BEFS spectrum is very similar to the
spectrum obtained by FUSE at the same orbital phase: there is no indication of
the impending eruption. However, the trend for decreasing wind velocity
suggests the occurrence of the ""bi-stability"" mechanism, which in turn implies
that the restructuring of the circumbinary environment caused by the transition
from ""fast, rarefied wind"" to ""slow, dense wind"" was observed as the eruptive
event. The underlying mechanism responsible for the long-term decrease in wind
velocity that precipitated this change remains an open issue.",2006-06-28T23:35:24Z
"Outflows from the high-mass protostars NGC 7538 IRS1/2 observed with
  bispectrum speckle interferometry -- Signatures of flow precession","NGC 7538 IRS1 is a high-mass (approx. 30 M_sun) protostar with a CO outflow,
an associated UCHII region, and a linear methanol maser structure, which might
trace a Keplerian-rotating circumstellar disk. The directions of the various
associated axes are misaligned with each other. We investigate the
near-infrared morphology of the source to clarify the relations among the
various axes. K'-band bispectrum speckle interferometry was performed at two
6-meter-class telescopes -- the BTA 6m telescope and the 6.5m MMT.
Complementary IRAC images from the Spitzer Space Telescope Archive were used to
relate the structures detected with the outflow at larger scales. High-dynamic
range images show fan-shaped outflow structure in which we detect 18 stars and
several blobs of diffuse emission. We interpret the misalignment of various
outflow axes in the context of a disk precession model, including numerical
hydrodynamic simulations of the molecular emission. The precession period is
approx. 280 years and its half-opening angle is 40 degrees. A possible
triggering mechanism is non-coplanar tidal interaction of an (undiscovered)
close companion with the circumbinary protostellar disk. Our observations
resolve the nearby massive protostar NGC 7538 IRS2 as a close binary with
separation of 195 mas. We find indications for shock interaction between the
outflow activities in IRS1 and IRS2. Indications of outflow precession have
been discovered to date in a number of massive protostars, all with large
precession angles 20--45 degrees. This might explain the difference between the
outflow widths in low- and high-mass stars and add support to a common
collimation mechanism.",2006-04-14T15:47:17Z
The Monitor project: Rotation of low-mass stars in the open cluster M34,"We report on the results of a V and i-band time-series photometric survey of
M34 (NGC 1039) using the Wide Field Camera (WFC) on the Isaac Newton Telescope
(INT), achieving better than 1% precision per data point for 13 <~ i <~ 17.
Candidate cluster members were selected from a V vs V-I colour-magnitude
diagram over 14 < V < 24 (0.12 <~ M/Msun <~ 1.0), finding 714 candidates, of
which we expect ~ 400 to be real cluster members (taking into account
contamination from the field). The mass function was computed, and found to be
consistent with a log-normal distribution in dN/dlogM. Searching for periodic
variable objects in the candidate members gave 105 detections over the mass
range 0.25 < M/Msun < 1.0. The distribution of rotation periods for 0.4 <
M/Msun < 1.0 was found to peak at ~ 7 days, with a tail of fast rotators down
to periods of ~ 0.8 days. For 0.25 < M/Msun < 0.4 we found a peak at short
periods, with a lack of slow rotators (eg. P >~ 5 days, consistent with the
work of other authors (eg. Scholz & Eisloffel 2004) at very low masses. Our
results are interpreted in the context of previous work, finding that we
reproduce the same general features in the rotational period distributions. A
number of rapid rotators were found with velocities ~ a factor of two lower
than in the Pleiades, consistent with models of angular momentum evolution
assuming solid body rotation without needing to invoke core-envelope
decoupling.",2006-05-24T09:15:32Z
Be stars: one ring to rule them all?,"Aims. We report theoretical spectral energy distributions (SEDs), Br$\gamma$
line profiles and visibilities for two scenarios that can explain the disk
dissipation of active hot stars an account for the transition from the Be to
the B spectroscopic phase. Methods. We use the SIMECA code to investigate these
two scenarios: the first one where the disk is formed by successive outbursts
of the central star. A low-density region is developing above the star and
slowly grows outward and forms a ring-like structure that will gradually
excavate the disk. The second one, where a slowly decreasing mass loss, for
instance due to a decrease of the radiative force through an opacity change at
the base of the photosphere, may also be responsible for the vanishing of the
circumstellar disk. Results. We obtain that a clear signature of the disk
dissipation following the ring scenario will be the disappearance of the high
velocity tails in the emission lines and a nearly constant peaks separation.
Moreover, we found that following the ring-like scenario the visibilities must
show an increasing second lobe, an increase of the value of the first zero and,
assuming an unresolved central star, a first zero of the visibility curves that
appends at shorter baselines as far as the disk is been excavate. We propose to
use the AMBER instrument on the VLTI to probe if the the ring scenario is the
one that rule the Be phenomenon.",2006-06-09T14:12:23Z
"Ages and metallicities of early-type galaxies in the SDSS: new insight
  into the physical origin of the colour-magnitude and the Mg2-sigmaV relations","We exploit recent constraints on the ages and metallicities of early-type
galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to gain new insight into the
physical origin of two fundamental relations obeyed by these galaxies: the
colour-magnitude and the Mg2-sigmaV relations. Our sample consists of 26,003
galaxies selected from the SDSS DR2 on the basis of their concentrated light
profiles, for which we have previously derived median-likelihood estimates of
stellar metallicity, light-weighted age and stellar mass. Our analysis provides
the most unambiguous demonstration to date of the fact that both relations are
primarily sequences in stellar mass and that total stellar metallicity,
alpha-elements-to-iron abundance ratio and light-weighted age all increase with
mass along the two relations. For high-mass ellipticals, the dispersion in age
is small and consistent with the error. At the low-mass end, there is a tail
towards younger ages, which dominates the scatter in colour and index strength
at fixed mass. A small, but detectable, intrinsic scatter in the
mass-metallicity relation also contributes to the scatter in the two
observational scaling relations, even at high masses. Our results suggest that
the chemical composition of an early-type galaxy is more tightly related to its
dynamical mass (including stars and dark matter) than to its stellar mass. The
ratio between stellar mass and dynamical mass appears to decrease from the
least massive to the most massive galaxies in our sample.",2006-05-11T16:44:47Z
"CRPropa: A Numerical Tool for the Propagation of UHE Cosmic Rays,
  Gamma-rays and Neutrinos","To understand the origin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs, defined to
be above 10^18 eV), it is required to model in a realistic way their
propagation in the Universe. UHECRs can interact with low energy radio,
microwave, infrared and optical photons to produce electron/positron pairs or
pions. The latter decay and give rise to neutrinos and electromagnetic cascades
extending down to MeV energies. In addition, deflections in cosmic magnetic
fields can influence the spectrum and sky distribution of primary cosmic rays
and, due to the increased propagation path length, the secondary neutrino and
gamma-ray fluxes. Neutrino, gamma-ray, cosmic ray physics and extra-galactic
magnetic fields are, therefore, strongly linked subjects and should be
considered together in order to extract maximal information from existing and
future data, like the one expected from the Auger Observatory. For that
purpose, we have developed CRPropa, a publicly-available numerical package
which takes into account interactions and deflections of primary UHECRs as well
as propagation of secondary electromagnetic cascades and neutrinos. CRPropa
allows to compute the observable properties of UHECRs and their secondaries in
a variety of models for the sources and propagation of these particles. Here we
present physical processes taken into account as well as benchmark examples; a
detailed documentation of the code can be found on our web site.",2006-03-24T17:18:06Z
On the Nature of Part Time Radio Pulsars,"The recent discovery of rotating radio transients and the quasi-periodicity
of pulsar activity in the radio pulsar PSR B1931$+$24 has challenged the
conventional theory of radio pulsar emission. Here we suggest that these
phenomena could be due to the interaction between the neutron star
magnetosphere and the surrounding debris disk. The pattern of pulsar emission
depends on whether the disk can penetrate the light cylinder and efficiently
quench the processes of particle production and acceleration inside the
magnetospheric gap. A precessing disk may naturally account for the
switch-on/off behavior in PSR B1931$+$24.",2006-06-21T07:42:36Z
"Metal Enrichment of the ICM: a 3-D Picture of Chemical and Dynamical
  Properties","We develop a model for the metal enrichment of the intracluster medium (ICM)
that combines a cosmological non-radiative hydrodynamical N-Body/SPH simulation
of a cluster of galaxies, and a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. The
novel feature of our hybrid model is that the chemical properties of the
diffuse gas in the underlying simulation are dynamically and consistently
generated from stars in the galaxies. We follow the production of several
chemical elements, provided by low- and intermediate-mass stars, core collapse
and type Ia supernovae. We analyse the spatial distribution of metals in the
ICM, investigate the way in which the chemical enrichment proceeds, and use
iron emissivity as a tracer of gas motions. Fe and O radial abundance profiles
are enhanced in the inner 100 h^-1 kpc in the last Gyr because of the
convergence of enriched gas clumps to the cluster centre. Our results support a
scenario in which part of the central intracluster gas comes from gas clumps
that, in the redshift range of z~0.2 to ~0.5, have been enriched to solar
values and are at large distances from the cluster centre (from ~1 to ~6 h^-1
Mpc) moving at very high velocities (from ~1300 to ~2500 km s^-1). The
turbulent gas motions within the cluster, originated in the inhomogeneous gas
infall during the cluster assembly, are manifested in emission-weighted
velocity maps as gradients that can be as large as ~1000 km s^-1 over distances
of a few hundred kpc. Gradients of this magnitude are also seen in velocity
distributions along sightlines through the cluster centre. Doppler shifting and
broadening suffered by the Fe K 6.7 keV emission line along such sightlines
could be used to probe these gas large-scale motions when they are produced
within an area characterised by high iron line emissivity.",2006-03-10T14:51:49Z
"Formation and Evolution of Planetary Systems: Upper Limits to the Gas
  Mass in Disks Around Sun-like Stars","We have carried out a sensitive search for gas emission lines at infrared and
millimeter wavelengths for a sample of 15 young sun-like stars selected from
our dust disk survey with the Spitzer Space Telescope. We have used
mid-infrared lines to trace the warm (300-100 K) gas in the inner disk and
millimeter transitions of 12CO to probe the cold (~20 K) outer disk. We report
no gas line detections from our sample. Line flux upper limits are first
converted to warm and cold gas mass limits using simple approximations allowing
a direct comparison with values from the literature. We also present results
from more sophisticated models following Gorti and Hollenbach (2004) which
confirm and extend our simple analysis. These models show that the SI line at
25.23 micron can set constraining limits on the gas surface density at the disk
inner radius and traces disk regions up to a few AU. We find that none of the
15 systems have more than 0.04 MJ of gas within a few AU from the disk inner
radius for disk radii from 1 AU up to ~40 AU. These gas mass upper limits even
in the 8 systems younger than ~30 Myr suggest that most of the gas is dispersed
early. The gas mass upper limits in the 10-40 AU region, that is mainly traced
by our CO data, are <2 Mearth. If these systems are analogs of the Solar
System, either they have already formed Uranus- and Neptune-like planets or
they will not form them beyond 100 Myr. Finally, the gas surface density upper
limits at 1 AU are smaller than 0.01% of the minimum mass solar nebula for most
of the sources. If terrestrial planets form frequently and their orbits are
circularized by gas, then circularization occurs early.",2006-06-27T22:28:17Z
"The Diverse Solar Phase Curves of Distant Icy Bodies. Part I:
  Photometric Observations of 18 Trans-Neptunian Objects, 7 Centaurs, and
  Nereid","We have measured the solar phase curves in B, V, and I for 18 Trans-Neptunian
Objects, 7 Centaurs, and Nereid and determined the rotation curves for 10 of
these targets. For each body, we have made ~100 observations uniformly spread
over the entire visible range. We find that all the targets except Nereid have
linear phase curves at small phase angles (< 2 deg) with widely varying phase
coefficients (0.0 to 0.4 mag/deg). At phase angles > 3 deg, the Centaurs
(54598) Bienor and (32532) Thereus have phase curves that flatten. The recently
discovered Pluto-scale bodies (2003 UB313, 2005 FY9, and 2003 EL61), like
Pluto, have neutral colors compared to most TNOs and small phase coefficients
(< 0.1 mag/deg). Together these two properties are a likely indication for
large TNOs of high-albedo, freshly coated icy surfaces. We find several bodies
with significantly wavelength-dependent phase curves. The TNOs (50000) Quaoar,
(120348) 2004 TY364 (47932), and 2000 GN171 have unusually high I-band phase
coefficients (0.290+/-0.038, 0.413+/-0.064, 0.281+/-0.033 mag/deg,
respectively) and much lower coefficients in the B and V bands. Their phase
coefficients increase in proportion to wavelength by 0.5 - 0.8 mag/deg/um. The
phase curves for TNOs with small B-band phase coefficients (< 0.1 mag/deg) have
a similar but weaker wavelength dependence. Coherent backscatter is the likely
cause for the wavelength dependence for all these bodies. We see no such
dependence for the Centaurs, which have visual albedos ~0.05.",2006-05-31T16:33:15Z
An Energetic Afterglow From A Distant Stellar Explosion,"We present the discovery of radio afterglow emission from the high redshift
(z=6.295) burst GRB 050904. The peak flux density for this burst is similar to
typical low-redshift gamma-ray bursts (GRB). We further show that beyond a
redshift of order unity, the flux density of radio afterglows are largely
insensitive to redshift, consistent with predictions. By combining the existing
X-ray, near-infrared and radio measurements, we derive estimates for the
kinetic energy and opening angle of the blast wave, and for the density of the
circumburst medium into which it expands. Both the kinetic and radiated energy
indicate that GRB 050904 was an unusally energetic burst (10**52 erg). More
importantly, we are able to make an in situ measurement of the density
structure of the circumburst medium. We conclude that GRB 050904 exploded into
a constant density medium with n=680 cm**-3, which is two orders of magnitude
above the nominal value for low-redshift GRBs. The next generation of
centimeter (EVLA) and millimeter radio instuments (ALMA) will be able to
routinely detect events like GRB 050904 and use them to study magnetic fields,
and the atomic and molecular gas in the high redshift Universe.",2006-04-27T19:54:30Z
"Statistical Study of the Reconnection Rate in Solar Flares Observed with
  YOHKOH/SXT","We report a statistical study of flares observed with the Soft X-ray
Telescope (SXT) onboard Yohkoh in the year of 2000. We measure physical
parameters of 77 flares, such as the temporal scale, the size, and the magnetic
flux density and find that the sizes of flares tend to be distributed more
broadly as the GOES class becomes weaker and that there is a lower limit of
magnetic flux density that depends on the GOES class. We also examine the
relationship between these parameters and find weak correlation between
temporal and spatial scales of flares. We estimate reconnection inflow
velocity, coronal Alfven velocity, and reconnection rate using above observed
values. The inflow velocities are distributed from a few km/s to several tens
km/s and the Alfven velocities in the corona are in the range from 10^3 to 10^4
km/s. Hence the reconnection rate is 10^-3 - 10^-2. We find that the
reconnection rate in a flare tends to decrease as the GOES class of the flare
increases. This value is within one order of magnitude from the theoretical
maximum value predicted by the Petschek model, although the dependence of the
reconnection rate on the magnetic Reynolds number tends to be stronger than
that in the Petschek model.",2006-05-30T07:58:39Z
SINS of Viscosity Damped Turbulence,"The problems with explaining the Small Ionized and Neutral Structures (SINS)
appealing to turbulence stem from inefficiency of the Kolmogorov cascade in
creating large fluctuations at sufficiently small scales. However, other types
of cascades are possible. When magnetic turbulence in a fluid with viscosity
that is much larger than resistivity gets to a viscous damping scale, the
turbulence does not vanish. Instead, it gets into a different new regime.
Viscosity-damped turbulence produces fluctuations on the small scales. Magnetic
fields sheared by turbulent motions by eddies not damped by turbulence create
small scale filaments that are confined by the external plasma pressure. This
creates small scale density fluctuations. In addition, extended current sheets
create even stronger density gradients that accompany field reversals in the
plane perpendicular to mean magnetic field. Those can be responsible for the
SINS formation. This scenario is applicable to partially ionized gas. More
studies of reconnection in the viscosity dominated regime are necessary to
understand better the extend to which the magnetic reversals can compress the
gas.",2006-08-02T02:31:39Z
Atomic Carbon in APM 08279+5255 at z=3.91,"We present a detection of [CI] line emission in the lensed quasar APM
08279+5255 at z=3.91 using the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer. The [CI]
line velocity and width are similar to the values of previously detected high-J
CO and HCN lines in this source, suggesting that the emission from all of these
species arises from the same region. The apparent luminosity of the [CI] line
is L'(CI) = (3.1 +/- 0.4)x10^10 K km/s pc^2, which implies a neutral carbon
mass, M(CI) = (4.4+/-0.6)/m x10^7 M_sun, where m is the lensing magnification
factor. The [CI] line luminosity is consistent with the large molecular gas
mass inferred from the nuclear CO line luminosity ~10^11 /m M_sun. We also
present an upper limit on the H2O line luminosity in APM 08279+5255 of, L'(H2O)
< 1.8x10^10 K km/s pc^2 (3-sigma).",2006-07-12T20:21:36Z
A fresh look on the heating mechanisms of the Solar corona,"Recently using Particle-In-Cell simulations i.e. in the kinetic plasma
description Tsiklauri et al. and G\'enot et al. reported on a discovery of a
new mechanism of parallel electric field generation, which results in electron
acceleration. In this work we show that the parallel (to the uniform
unperturbed magnetic field) electric field generation can be obtained in much
simpler framework using ideal Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) description, i.e.
without resorting to complicated wave particle interaction effects such as ion
polarisation drift and resulting space charge separation which seems to be an
ultimate cause of the electron acceleration. Further, in the context of the
coronal heating problem a new {\it two stage mechanism} of the plasma heating
is presented by putting emphasis, first, on the generation of parallel electric
fields within {\it ideal MHD} description directly, rather than focusing on the
enhanced dissipation mechanisms of the Alfv\'en waves and, second, dissipation
of these parallel electric fields via {\it kinetic} effects. It is shown that a
single Alfv\'en wave harmonic with frequency ($\nu = 7$ Hz), (which has
longitudinal wavelength $\lambda_A = 0.63$ Mm for putative Alfv\'en speed of
4328 km s$^{-1}$) the generated parallel electric field could account for the
10% of the necessary coronal heating requirement. We conjecture that wide
spectrum (10$^{-4}-10^3$ Hz) Alfv\'en waves, based on observationally
constrained spectrum, could provide necessary coronal heating requirement.",2006-06-27T14:21:52Z
"3D photoionisation and dust RT modelling with MOCASSIN: geometry effects
  on the emission line spectra of star-forming regions","Emission line spectra from HII regions are often used to study properties of
the gas in star-forming regions, as well as temperatures and luminosities of
the ionising sources. Empirical diagnostics for the interpretation of
observational data must often be calibrated with the aid of photoionisation
models. Most studies so far have been carried out by assuming spherical or
plane-parallel geometries, with major limitations on allowed gas and dust
density distributions and with the spatial distribution of multiple,
non-centrally-located ionising sources not being accounted for. We present the
first results of our theoretical study of geometric effects, via the
construction of a number of 3D photoionisation models using the MOCASSIN code
for a variety of spatial configurations and ionisation sources. We compare
integrated emission line spectra from such configurations and show evidence of
systematic errors caused by the simplifying assumption of a single, central
location for all ionising sources.",2006-06-07T17:12:05Z
The lack of binaries among hot horizontal branch stars: M80 and NGC5986,"We present preliminary results of a our search for close (period P < 10 days)
binary systems among hot (Teff > 20000 K) horizontal branch stars in globular
clusters M80 and NGC5986. We measured radial velocity variations of 11 targets
in M80 and 5 in NGC5986, spectroscopically observed at medium resolution
(R=4100) during four nights at VLT-FORS2. We found one close binary candidate
in M80, showing statistically significative radial velocity variations, and no
clear evidence in NGC5986. These results confirm the lack of close binaries
among hot horizontal branch stars in globular clusters, as already found in
NGC6752, at variance with what observed among hot subdwarfs in the field.",2006-06-01T20:10:56Z

Fundamental parameters of six neglected old open clusters,"In this paper we present the first $BVI$ CCD photometry of six overlooked old
open clusters (Berkeley 44, NGC 6827, Berkeley 52, Berkeley 56, Skiff 1 and
Berkeley 5) and derive estimates of their fundamental parameters by using
isochrones from the Padova library (Girardi et al. 2000). We found that all the
clusters are older than the Hyades, with ages ranging from 0.8 (NGC 6827 and
Berkeley 5) to 4.0 (Berkeley 56) Gyr. This latter is one of the old open
clusters with the largest heliocentric distance. In the field of Skiff 1 we
recognize a faint blue Main Sequence identical to the one found in the
background of open clusters in the Second and Third Galactic Quadrant, and
routinely attributed to the Canis Major accretion event. We use the synthetic
Color Magnitude Diagram method and a Galactic model to show that this
population can be easily interpreted as Thick Disk and Halo population toward
Skiff 1. We finally revise the old open clusters age distribution, showing that
the previously suggested peak at 5 Gyr looses importance as additional old
clusters are discovered.",2006-06-28T22:40:43Z
"A ""Missing"" Supernova Remnant revealed by the 21-cm Line of Atomic
  Hydrogen","Although some 20--30,000 supernova remnants (SNRs) are expected to exist in
the Milky Way, only about 230 are presently known. This implies that most SNRs
are ``missing''. Recently, we proposed that small ($\simlt 1^\circ$), faint,
high-velocity features seen in large-scale 21-cm line surveys of atomic
hydrogen ({\sc Hi}) in the Galactic plane could be examples of such {\it
missing} old SNRs. Here we report on high-resolution \schi observations of one
such candidate, FVW 190.2+1.1, which is revealed to be a rapidly expanding
($\sim 80$ \kms) shell. The parameters of this shell seem only consistent with
FVW 190.2+1.1 being the remnant of a SN explosion that occurred in the
outermost fringes of the Galaxy some $\sim 3\times 10^5$ yr ago. This shell is
not seen in any other wave band suggesting that it represents the oldest type
of SNR, that which is essentially invisible except via its \schi line emission.
FVW 190.2+1.1 is one of a hundred ""forbidden-velocity wings"" (FVWs) recently
identified in the Galactic plane, and our discovery suggests that many of these
are likely to be among the oldest SNRs. We discuss the possible link between
FVWs and fast-moving atomic clouds in the Galaxy.",2006-04-09T14:29:11Z
Lifetime of nuclear velocity dispersion drops in barred galaxies,"We have made hydro/N-body simulations with and without star formation to shed
some light on the conditions under which a central kinematically cold stellar
component (characterized by a velocity dispersion drop or \sigma-drop) could be
created in a hot medium (e.g. a bulge) and survive enough time to be observed.
We found that the timescale for a \sigma-drop formation could be short (less
than 500 Myr) whereas its lifetime could be long (more than 1 Gyr) provided
that the central region is continuously or regularly fed by fresh gas which
leads to a continuous star formation activity. Star formation in the central
region, even at a low rate as 1M_{sol} yr^{-1}, is mandatory to sustain a
permanent \sigma-drop by replacing heated particles by new low-\sigma ones. We
moreover show that as soon as star formation is switched off, the \sigma-drop
begins to disappear.",2006-03-29T09:29:42Z
Populating the Galaxy with low-mass X-ray binaries,"We perform binary population synthesis calculations to investigate the
incidence of low-mass X-ray binaries and their birth rate in the Galaxy. We use
a binary evolution algorithm that models all the relevant processes including
tidal circularization and synchronization. Parameters in the evolution
algorithm that are uncertain and may affect X-ray binary formation are allowed
to vary during the investigation. We agree with previous studies that under
standard assumptions of binary evolution the formation rate and number of
black-hole low-mass X-ray binaries predicted by the model are more than an
order of magnitude less than what is indicated by observations. We find that
the common-envelope process cannot be manipulated to produce significant
numbers of black-hole low-mass X-ray binaries. However, by simply reducing the
mass-loss rate from helium stars adopted in the standard model, to a rate that
agrees with the latest data, we produce a good match to the observations.
Including low-mass X-ray binaries that evolve from intermediate-mass systems
also leads to favourable results. We stress that constraints on the X-ray
binary population provided by observations are used here merely as a guide as
surveys suffer from incompleteness and much uncertainty is involved in the
interpretation of results.",2006-05-03T03:55:47Z
"Extended inverse-Compton emission from distant, powerful radio galaxies","We present Chandra observations of two relatively high redshift FRII radio
galaxies, 3C 432 and 3C 191 (z=1.785 and z=1.956 respectively), both of which
show extended X-ray emission along the axis of the radio jet or lobe. This
X-ray emission is most likely to be due to inverse-Compton scattering of Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Under this assumption we estimate the
minimum energy contained in the particles responsible. This can be extrapolated
to determine a rough estimate of the total energy. We also present new, deep
radio observations of 3C 294, which confirm some association between radio and
X-ray emission along the NE-SW radio axis and also that radio emission is not
detected over the rest of the extent of the diffuse X-ray emission. This,
together with the offset between the peaks of the X-ray and radio emissions may
indicate that the jet axis in this source is precessing.",2006-06-09T16:52:29Z
"The nucleosynthesis of Al26 and Fe60 in solar metallicity stars
  extending in mass from 11 to 120 Msun: the hydrostatic and explosive
  contributions","We present the \nuk{Al}{26} and \nuk{Fe}{60} yields produced by a generation
of solar metallicity stars ranging in mass between 11 and 120\msun. We discuss
the production sites of these $\gamma$ ray emitters and quantify the relative
contributions of the various components. More specifically we provide the
separate contribution of the wind, the C convective shell and the explosive
Ne/C burning to the total \nuk{Al}{26} yield per each stellar model in our
grid. We provide the contributions of the He convective shell, the C convective
shell and the explosive Ne/C burning to the \nuk{Fe}{60} yield as well. From
these computations we conclude that, at variance with current beliefs,
\nuk{Al}{26} is mainly produced by the explosive C/Ne burning over most of the
mass interval presently analyzed while \nuk{Fe}{60} is mainly produced by the C
convective shell and the He convective shell.",2006-04-13T11:22:50Z
High Resolution Simulations of Supersonic Turbulence in Molecular Clouds,"We present the results of three-dimensional simulations of supersonic Euler
turbulence with grid resolutions up to 1024^3 points. Our numerical experiments
describe nonmagnetized driven turbulent flows with an isothermal equation of
state and an rms Mach number of 6. We demonstrate that the inertial range
scaling properties of turbulence in this strongly compressible regime deviate
substantially from a Kolmogorov-like behavior previously recovered for mildly
compressible transonic flows.",2006-07-28T20:40:50Z
"Simulating the formation of molecular clouds. I. Slow formation by
  gravitational collapse from static initial conditions","We study the formation of H2 in the ISM, using a modified version of the
astrophysical magnetohydrodynamical code ZEUS-MP that includes a
non-equilibrium treatment of the formation and destruction of H2. We examine
two different approximations to treat the shielding of H2 against
photodissociation: a local approximation, which gives us a solid lower bound on
the amount of shielding, and a method based on ray-tracing that is considerably
more accurate in some circumstances but that produces results that are harder
to clearly interpret. Either approximation allows one to perform
three-dimensional high-resolution simulations of cloud formation with only
modest computational resources. We also include a detailed treatment of the
thermal behaviour of the gas.
  In this paper, we focus on the problem of molecular cloud formation in
gravitationally unstable, initially static gas. We show that in these
conditions, and for initial densities consistent with those observed in the
cold, neutral atomic phase of the interstellar medium, H2 formation occurs on a
timescale t > 10 Myr, comparable to or longer than the gravitational free-fall
timescale of the cloud. We also show that the collapsing gas very quickly
reaches thermal equilibrium and that the equation of state of the gas is
generally softer than isothermal.
  Finally, we demonstrate that although these results show little sensitivity
to variations in most of our simulation parameters, they are highly sensitive
to the assumed initial density n_i. Reducing n_i significantly increases the
cloud formation timescale and decreases the amount of hydrogen ultimately
converted to H2. (Abridged).",2006-05-04T10:04:41Z
Debris Disks Around White Dwarfs: The DAZ Connection,"We present near-infrared spectroscopic observations of 20 previously known
DAZ white dwarfs obtained at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. Two of these
white dwarfs (G29-38 and GD362) are known to display significant K-band
excesses due to circumstellar debris disks. Here we report the discovery of
excess K-band radiation from another DAZ white dwarf, WD0408-041 (GD56). Using
spectroscopic observations, we show that the excess radiation cannot be
explained by a stellar or substellar companion, and is likely to be caused by a
warm debris disk. Our observations strengthen the connection between the debris
disk phenomena and the observed metal abundances in cool DAZ white dwarfs.
However, we do not find any excess infrared emission from the most metal rich
DAZs with $T_{\rm eff}=$ 16000 -- 20000 K. This suggests that the metal
abundances in warmer DAZ white dwarfs may require another explanation.",2006-03-28T21:19:25Z
Unveiling obscured accretion,"We present the latest determination of the X-ray (2-10 keV) AGN luminosity
function accounting for the selection effect due to X-ray absorption. The main
results are: 1) the inclusion of obscured AGN confirms the AGN differential
luminosity evolution, but makes it less extreme than what is found selecting
unobscured AGN in soft X-rays, and more similar to a pure luminosity evolution;
2) significant correlations are found between the fraction of obscured sources,
the luminosity and the redshift, this fraction increasing toward both low AGN
luminosities and high redshifts. We discuss our findings in a scenario for the
formation and evolution of the structure in the Universe where the bulk of
nuclear activity is produced at z=1-2. At the same redshifts also the
star-formation rate reaches a maximum, and this age can therefore be regarded
as the ""golden age"" for nuclear and galaxy activity. We discuss the current
observational limits of this program and the improvements needed to obtain an
unbiased census of the AGN and super-massive black hole (SMBH) population.",2006-03-30T16:05:03Z
"ELTs Adaptive Optics for Multi-Objects 3D Spectroscopy : Key Parameters
  and Design Rules","In the last few years, new Adaptive Optics [AO] techniques have emerged to
answer new astronomical challenges: Ground-Layer AO [GLAO] and Multi-Conjugate
AO [MCAO] to access a wider Field of View [FoV], Multi-Object AO [MOAO] for the
simultaneous observation of several faint galaxies, eXtreme AO [XAO] for the
detection of faint companions. In this paper, we focus our study to one of
these applications : high red-shift galaxy observations using MOAO techniques
in the framework of Extremely Large Telescopes [ELTs]. We present the
high-level specifications of a dedicated instrument. We choose to describe the
scientific requirements with the following criteria : 40% of Ensquared Energy
[EE] in H band (1.65um) and in an aperture size from 25 to 150 mas. Considering
these specifications we investigate different AO solutions thanks to Fourier
based simulations. Sky Coverage [SC] is computed for Natural and Laser Guide
Stars [NGS, LGS] systems. We show that specifications are met for NGS-based
systems at the cost of an extremely low SC. For the LGS approach, the option of
low order correction with a faint NGS is discussed. We demonstrate that, this
last solution allows the scientific requirements to be met together with a
quasi full SC.",2006-06-11T14:45:03Z
OB Stars in the Solar Neighborhood II: Kinematics,"Using the spatial classification method and the structural parameters
estimated for the Gould Belt (GB) and the local Galactic disk (LGD) from a
previous paper, we have evaluated spatial membership probabilities for a sample
of O and B stars from the Hipparcos catalogue (ESA 1997) with available proper
motions and radial velocity data. Thus being able to study the space velocity
fields of both systems, we conclude that the GB and the LGD present different
statistical distributions, both in the velocity space as well as in the phase
space. In the light of the existence of both systems we analyze different
kinematic aspects in the vicinity of the Sun, and we find the GB to be
responsible for the highly negative vertex deviation found for the OB stars in
the solar neighborhood. We also find that the GB sensibly alters the estimation
of Oort's constants in the Galactic disk; thus, in order to establish
comparisons with other kinematic studies based in older stellar populations, a
careful pruning of the GB members must be performed. Further analysis of the GB
velocity field and the moving groups that contribute to it suggest the
possibility that the GB can be the result of a chance superposition of moving
groups. We propose for future investigations the dynamical analysis of these
moving groups in order to probe the origin of the GB.",2006-05-17T09:13:18Z
"Sources of Radiation in the Early Universe: The Equation of Radiative
  Transfer and Optical Distances","We have derived the radiative-transfer equation for a point source with a
specified intensity and spectrum, originating in the early Universe between the
epochs of annihilation and recombination, at redshifts $z_\s =10^8\div 10^4$.
The direct radiation of the source is separated from the diffuse radiation it
produces. Optical distances from the source for Thomson scattering and
bremsstrahlung absorption at the maximum of the thermal background radiation
are calculated as a function of the redshift z.The distances grow sharply with
decreasing z, approaching asymptotic values, the absorption distance increasing
more slowly and reaching their limiting values at lower z. For the adopted z
values, the optical parameters of the Universe can be described in a flat model
with dusty material and radiation, and radiative transfer can be treated in a
grey approximation.",2006-03-11T21:02:05Z
Dynamic Alignment and Exact Scaling Laws in MHD Turbulence,"Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is pervasive in astrophysical systems.
Recent high-resolution numerical simulations suggest that the energy spectrum
of strong incompressible MHD turbulence is $E(k_{\perp})\propto
k_{\perp}^{-3/2}$. So far, there has been no phenomenological theory that
simultaneously explains this spectrum and satisfies the exact analytic
relations for MHD turbulence due to Politano & Pouquet. Indeed, the
Politano-Pouquet relations are often invoked to suggest that the spectrum of
MHD turbulence instead has the Kolmogorov scaling -5/3. Using geometrical
arguments and numerical tests, here we analyze this seeming contradiction and
demonstrate that the -3/2 scaling and the Politano-Pouquet relations are
reconciled by the phenomenon of scale-dependent dynamic alignment that was
recently discovered in MHD turbulence.",2006-05-09T13:36:14Z
"Can Ejecta-Dominated Supernova Remnants be Typed from their X-ray
  Spectra? The Case of G337.2-0.7","In this paper we use recent X-ray and radio observations of the ejecta-rich
Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) G337.2-0.7 to determine properties of the
supernova (SN) explosion that formed this source. H I absorption measurements
from the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) constrain the distance to
G337.2-0.7 to lie between 2.0 +/- 0.5 and 9.3 +/- 0.3 kpc. Combined with a
clear radio image of the outer blast-wave, this distance allows us to estimate
the dynamical age (between 750 and 3500 years) from the global X-ray spectrum
obtained with the XMM-Newton and Chandra observatories. The presence of ejecta
is confirmed by the pattern of fitted relative abundances, which show Mg, Ar
and Fe to be less enriched (compared to solar) than Si, S or Ca, and the ratio
of Ca to Si to be 3.4 +/- 0.8 times the solar value (under the assumption of a
single electron temperature and single ionization timescale). With the addition
of a solar abundance component for emission from the blast-wave, these
abundances (with the exception of Fe) resemble the ejecta of a Type Ia, rather
than core-collapse, SN. Comparing directly to models of the ejecta and
blast-wave X-ray emission calculated by evolving realistic SN Ia explosions to
the remnant stage allows us to deduce that one-dimensional delayed detonation
and pulsed delayed detonation models can indeed reproduce the major features of
the global spectrum. In particular, stratification of the ejecta, with the Fe
shocked most recently, is required to explain the lack of prominent Fe-K
emission.",2006-04-11T17:46:12Z
Mass and Environment Drive the Evolution of Early-Type Galaxies,"New information has recently become available on the fundamental plane for
various samples of early-type galaxies with redshift up to 1.3, both in
clusters and in the field. This information is reviewed and clues are derived
on the evolution of spheroids over the last two thirds of the Universe lifetime
as a function of galaxy mass and environment, in comparison with the
predictions of the hierarchical models of galaxy formation. Using the Universe
as a time-machine and interpreting changes in M/L ratio as age differences, we
see that the age increases with galaxy mass in all environments, cluster
galaxies with any mass are older than field galaxies with the same mass, and
the age difference between cluster and field galaxies increases with mass. The
first two results confirm those obtained with other methods, and are reproduced
by the most recent incarnation of the hierarchical models, while the third
result is new and appears in contrast with the predictions of these models.",2006-07-14T10:14:42Z
Continuous optical monitoring during the prompt emission of GRB 060111B,"We present the time-resolved optical emission of GRB 060111B during its
prompt phase, measured with the TAROT robotic observatory. This is the first
time that the optical emission from a gamma-ray burst has been continuously
monitored with a temporal resolution of a few seconds during the prompt
gamma-ray phase. The temporal evolution of the prompt optical emission at the
level of several seconds is used to provide a clue to the origin of this
emission. The optical emission was found to decay steadily from our first
measure, 28s after the trigger, in contrast to the gamma-ray emission, which
exhibits strong variability at the same time. This behaviour strongly suggests
that the optical emission is due to the reverse shock.",2006-04-04T13:41:08Z
"Discovery of a 3.6-hr Eclipsing Luminous X-Ray Binary in the Galaxy NGC
  4214","We report the discovery of an eclipsing X-ray binary with a 3.62-hr period
within 24"" of the center of the dwarf starburst galaxy NGC 4214. The orbital
period places interesting constraints on the nature of the binary, and allows
for a few very different interpretations. The most likely possibility is that
the source lies within NGC 4214 and has an X-ray luminosity of up to 7 e38
ergs/s. In this case the binary may well be comprised of a naked He-burning
donor star with a neutron-star accretor, though a stellar-mass black-hole
accretor cannot be completely excluded. There is no obvious evidence for a
strong stellar wind in the X-ray orbital light curve that would be expected
from a massive He star; thus, the mass of the He star should be <3-4 solar
masses. If correct, this would represent a new class of very luminous X-ray
binary -- perhaps related to Cyg X-3. Other less likely possibilities include a
conventional low-mass X-ray binary that somehow manages to produce such a high
X-ray luminosity and is apparently persistent over an interval of years; or a
foreground AM Her binary of much lower luminosity that fortuitously lies in the
direction of NGC 4214. Any model for this system must accommodate the lack of
an optical counterpart down to a limiting magnitude of 22.6 in the visible.",2006-04-21T14:36:19Z
"Cosmological viability of f(R)-gravity as an ideal fluid and its
  compatibility with a matter dominated phase","We show that f(R)-gravity can, in general, give rise to cosmological viable
models compatible with a matter-dominated epoch evolving into a late
accelerated phase. We discuss the various representations of f(R)-gravity as an
ideal fluid or a scalar-tensor gravity theory, taking into account conformal
transformations. We point out that mathematical equivalence does not
correspond, in several cases, to the physical equivalence of Jordan frame and
Einstein frame. Finally, we show that wide classes of f(R)-gravity models,
including matter and accelerated phases, can be phenomenologically
reconstructed by means of observational data. In principle, any popular
quintessence models could be ""reframed"" as an f(R)-gravity model.",2006-04-20T14:30:49Z
Recognizing the First Radiation Sources Through Their 21-cm Signature,"At the beginning of the reionization epoch, radiation sources produce
fluctuations in the redshifted 21-cm background. We show that different types
of sources (such as miniquasars, Pop II and III stars, supernovae, etc.)
produce distinct signatures in the 21-cm signal radial profiles and statistical
fluctuations, through which they can be identified. Further, we show that the
21-cm signal from X-ray emitting sources is much easier to observe than was
expected, due to a previously neglected pumping mechanism.",2006-05-19T20:12:49Z
Anatomy of A Dark Burst - The Afterglow of GRB 060108,"We report the first detection of an optical afterglow of a GRB (060108) that
would have been classified as 'dark' in the absence of deep, rapid ground-based
optical imaging with the 2-m robotic Faulkes Telesscope (FTN). Our
multiwavelength analysis reveals an X-ray light curve typical of many Swift
long GRBs (3-segments plus flare). Its optical afterglow, however, was already
fainter than the detection limit of the UVOT within 100s of the burst. Optical
imaging in BVRi' filters with the FTN began 2.75 minutes after the burst and
resulted in the detection of the optical afterglow at 5.3 minutes, with a UKIRT
K-band identification at ~45 mins. R and i'-band light curves are consistent
with a single power law decay in flux, F(t) prop t^-a where a=0.43+/-0.08, or a
2-segment light curve with a steep decay a_1 <0.88, flattening to a_2 ~ 0.31,
with evidence for rebrightening at i' band. Deep VLT R-band imaging at ~12 days
reveals a faint, extended object (R ~23.5 mag) at the location of the
afterglow. Although the brightness is compatible with the extrapolation of the
a_2 slow decay, significant flux is likely due to a host galaxy. This implies
that the optical light curve had a break before 12 days, akin to what observed
in the X-rays. We derive a maximum photometric redshift z<3.2 for GRB 060108
and a best-fitting optical-to-X-ray SED at 1000 s after the burst consistent
with a power law with index beta_OX = 0.54 and a small amount of extinction.
The unambiguous detection at B-band and the derived photometric redshift rule
out a high redshift as the reason for the optical faintness of GRB 060108.
Instead, the hard opt/X-ray spectral index confirms it as one of the
optically-darkest bursts detected and with modest host extinction explains the
UVOT non-detection (abridged).",2006-07-26T19:04:06Z
"Neutron-capture elements in the s- and r-process-rich stars: Constraints
  on neutron-capture nucleosynthesis processes","The chemical abundances of the very metal-poor double-enhanced stars are
excellent information for setting new constraints on models of neutron-capture
processes at low metallicity. These stars are known as s+r stars, since they
show enhancements of both s-process and r-process elements. The observed
abundance ratios for the double-enhanced stars can be explained by those of
stars that were polluted by an AGB star and subsequently accreted very
significant amounts of r-process material out of an AIC (accretion-induced
collapse) or Type 1.5 supernova. In this paper we present for the first time an
attempt to fit the elemental abundances observed in the s- and r-rich, very
metal-poor stars using a parametric model and suggest a new concept of
component coefficients to describe the contributions of the individual
neutron-capture processes to double-enhanced stars. We find that the abundance
ratios of these stars are best fitted by enrichments of s- and r-process
material. The overlap factor in the AGB stars where the observed s-process
elements were produced lies between 0.1 and 0.81. Taking into account the
dependence of the initial-final mass relations on metallicity, this wide range
of values could possibly be explained by a wide range of core-mass values of
AGB stars at low metallicity. The component coefficient of the r-process is
strongly correlated with the component coefficient of the s-process for the
double-enhanced stars. This is significant evidence that the r-process material
in double-enhanced stars comes from an AIC or Type 1.5 supernova.",2006-05-14T12:18:41Z
"First direct detection of a Keplerian rotating disk around the Be star
  $α$ Arae using the VLTI/AMBER instrument","Aims. We aim to study the geometry and kinematics of the disk around the Be
star $\alpha$ Arae as a function of wavelength, especially across the
Br$\gamma$ emission line. The main purpose of this paper is to answer the
question about the nature of the disk rotation around Be stars. Methods. We use
the VLTI/AMBER instrument operating in the K band which provides a gain by a
factor 5 in spatial resolution compared to previous VLTI/MIDI observations.
Moreover, it is possible to combine the high angular resolution provided with
the (medium) spectral resolution of AMBER to study the kinematics of the inner
part of the disk and to infer its rotation law. Results. We obtain for the
first time the direct evidence that the disk is in keplerian rotation,
answering a question that occurs since the discovery of the first Be star
$\gamma$ Cas by father Secchi in 1866. We also present the global geometry of
the disk showing that it is compatible with a thin disk + polar enhanced winds
modeled with the SIMECA code. We found that the disk around $\alpha$ Arae is
compatible with a dense equatorial matter confined in the central region
whereas a polar wind is contributing along the rotational axis of the central
star. Between these two regions the density must be low enough to reproduce the
large visibility modulus (small extension) obtained for two of the four VLTI
baselines. Moreover, we obtain that $\alpha$ Arae is rotating very close to its
critical rotation. This scenario is also compatible with the previous MIDI
measurements.",2006-06-16T12:52:53Z
"The stellar masses of 25000 galaxies at 0.2<z<1.0 estimated by the
  COMBO-17 survey","We present an analysis of stellar mass estimates for a sample of 25000
galaxies from the COMBO-17 survey over the interval 0.2<z<1.0. We have
developed, implemented, and tested a new method of estimating stellar
mass-to-light ratios, which relies on redshift and spectral energy distribution
(SED) classification from 5 broadband and 12 medium band filters. We find that
the majority (>60%) of massive galaxies with M_* > 10^{11} solar masses at all
z<1 are non-star-forming; blue star-forming galaxies dominate at lower masses.
We have used these mass estimates to explore the evolution of the stellar mass
function since z=1. We find that the total stellar mass density of the universe
has roughly doubled since z~1. Our measurements are consistent with other
measurements of the growth of stellar mass with cosmic time and with estimates
of the time evolution of the cosmic star formation rate. Intriguingly, the
integrated stellar mass of blue galaxies with young stars has not significantly
changed since z~1, even though these galaxies host the majority of the star
formation: instead, the growth of the total stellar mass density is dominated
by the growth of the total mass in the largely passive galaxies on the red
sequence.",2006-04-19T12:43:34Z
"Resonance scattering, absorption and off-centre abundance peaks in
  clusters of galaxies","A possible explanation for the central abundance dips found from
spatially-resolved X-ray spectroscopy of several groups and clusters of
galaxies is resonance scattering. A number of the prominent iron emission lines
are resonance lines. We construct a unique spectral model which takes account
of resonance scattering for several thousand resonance lines, projection
effects, photoelectric absorption, and allows direct spectral fitting. We apply
our model to Chandra observations of two clusters with pronounced central
abundance dips, Centaurus and Abell 2199. The results show that the effect of
resonance scattering on emission from the centre of the cluster can be as much
as 30 per cent for the Fe-K resonance lines, and 10 per cent for several Fe-L
lines, if turbulence is low. The change to the metallicities obtained by
fitting low resolution CCD spectra is at most 10 per cent. Accounting for
resonance scattering does not remove the central dip. Allowing for internal
absorption within the Centaurus significantly improves the quality of the fits,
indicating the presence of absorbing material within the inner 40 kpc of NGC
4696.",2006-04-27T16:31:12Z
"Radio emission of highly inclined cosmic ray air showers measured with
  LOPES","LOPES (LOFAR Prototype Station) is an array of dipole antennas used for
detection of radio emission from air showers. It is co-located and triggered by
the KASCADE (Karlsruhe Shower Core and Array Detector) experiment, which also
provides informations about air shower properties. Even though neither LOPES
nor KASCADE are completely optimized for the detection of highly inclined
events, a significant number of showers with zenith angle larger than 50$^o$
have been detected in the radio domain, and many with very high field
strengths. Investigation of inclined showers can give deeper insight into the
nature of primary particles that initiate showers and also into the possibility
that some of detected showers are triggered by neutrinos. In this paper, we
show the example of such an event and present some of the characteristics of
highly inclined showers detected by LOPES.",2006-04-12T15:23:59Z
The evolution of massive stars in the context of V838 Monocerotis,"The aim of this paper is to look at the evolution of massive stars in order
to determine whether or not the progenitor of V838 Mon may be a massive star.
In the first part of this paper, the evolution of massive stars around solar
metallicity is described, especially the evolution in the Hertzsprung-Russell
(HR) diagram. Then, using the observational constraints, the probable
progenitors (and their evolution) are described. Using models of single stars,
no progenitor can be found amongst massive stars that can satisfy all the
observational constraints. Wolf-Rayet stars (stars with initial masses above
about 30 solar masses, which have lost their hydrogen rich envelopes) could
explain 10 to 100 solar masses of circumstellar material but they are very
luminous (L > 100,000 solar luminosities). Main sequence stars crossing the HR
diagram and becoming red supergiants (RSG) can have very low effective
temperatures but take thousands of years to cross over. Be stars (fast rotating
stars with a mass around 10 solar masses), which form disk or B stars accreting
matter from a binary companion of a similar mass would need to be compared in
detail with the observational constraints. In the future, there will hopefully
be further observational constraints on the models coming from the mass and
nature (interstellar or circumstellar) of the material producing the light echo
and from a frequency estimate of spectacular objects such as V838 Mon.",2006-07-25T12:38:04Z
"The impact of meridional circulation on stellar butterfly diagrams and
  polar caps","Observations of rapidly rotating solar-like stars show a significant mixture
of opposite-polarity magnetic fields within their polar regions. To explain
these observations, models describing the surface transport of magnetic flux
demand the presence of fast meridional flows. Here, we link sub-surface and
surface magnetic flux transport simulations to investigate (i) the impact of
meridional circulations with peak velocities of <125m/s on the latitudinal
eruption pattern of magnetic flux tubes and (ii) the influence of the resulting
butterfly diagrams on polar magnetic field properties. Prior to their eruption,
magnetic flux tubes with low field strengths and initial cross sections below
about 300km experience an enhanced poleward deflection through meridional
flows. In particular flux tubes which originate between low and intermediate
latitudes within the convective overshoot region are strongly affected. This
latitude-dependent poleward deflection of erupting magnetic flux renders the
wings of stellar butterfly diagrams distinctively convex. The subsequent
evolution of the surface magnetic field shows that the increased number of
newly emerging bipoles at higher latitudes promotes the intermingling of
opposite polarities of polar magnetic fields. The associated magnetic flux
densities are about 20% higher than in the case disregarding the pre-eruptive
deflection, which eases the necessity for fast meridional flows predicted by
previous investigations. In order to reproduce the observed polar field
properties, the rate of the meridional circulation has to be on the order of
100m/s, and the latitudinal range from which magnetic flux tubes originate at
the base of the convective zone (<50degrees) must be larger than in the solar
case (<35degrees).",2006-04-05T16:34:49Z
"A close look to quasar-triggered winds: is the black hole-bulge relation
  self-regulated?","We discuss the role of feedback from AGNs on the formation of spheroidal
galaxies. The energy released by an accreting Black Hole (BH) may be injected
into the ISM through blast waves arising directly from the central engine,
radiation pressure or radiative heating. A scenario is described in which
radiative heating perturbs the methabolism of a star-forming spheroid, leading
to a critical stage where SNe form a cold expanding shell, pushed out of the
galaxy by radiation pressure from the AGN. This mechanism can regulate the
BH--bulge relation to the observed value. However, this relation may be simply
imprinted by the mechanism responsible for the nearly complete loss of angular
momentum of the gas that accretes onto the BH. Using a novel model of galaxy
formation that includes AGNs, we show that models without self-regulation have
problems in reproducing the correct slope of the AGN luminosity function, while
models with winds give a much better fit; however, all these models are almost
indistingishable as far as their predicted BH--bulge relation is concerned.
Finally, we show that the downsizing of the faint AGNs is most likely due to
kinetic feedback in star-forming bulges.",2006-04-14T16:33:52Z
Accretion in protoplanetary disks: the imprint of core properties,"In this Letter we present a theoretical scenario to explain the steep
correlation between disk accretion rates and stellar masses observed in
pre-main sequence stars. We show that the correlations and spread observed in
the two best studied regions, rho-Ophiuchus and Taurus, can be reproduced by a
simple model of single star formation from a rotating collapsing core and the
viscous evolution of the circumstellar disk. In this model, the rate of
rotation of the parent core sets the value of the `centrifugal radius' within
which the infalling matter is loaded onto the surface of the disk. As a
consequence, the disk accretion rate measured long after the dispersal of the
parental core bears the imprint of the initial conditions of star formation.
The observed trend results naturally if, at the onset of the collapse, cores of
all masses rotate with the same distribution of angular velocities, measured in
units of the break-up rotation rate.",2006-05-13T11:20:49Z
Photometric study of selected cataclysmic variables,"We present time-resolved photometry of five relatively poorly-studied
cataclysmic variables: V1193 Ori, LQ Peg, LD 317, V795 Her, and MCT 2347-3144.
The observations were made using four 1m-class telescopes for a total of more
than 250 h of observation and almost 16,000 data points. For LQ Peg WHT
spectroscopic data have been analysed as well.
  The light curves show a wide range of variability on different time scales
from minutes to months. We detect for the first time a brightness variation of
0.05 mag in amplitude in V1193 Ori on the same timescale as the orbital period,
which we interpret as the result of the irradiation of the secondary. A 20-min
quasi-periodic oscillation is also detected. The mean brightness of the system
has changed by 0.5 mag on a three-month interval, while the flickering was
halved. In LQ Peg a 0.05 mag modulation was revealed with a period of about 3
h. The flickering was much smaller, of the order of 0.025 mag. A possible
quasi-periodic oscillation could exist near 30 min. For this object, the WHT
spectra are single-peaked and do not show any radial-velocity variations. The
data of LD 317 show a decrease in the mean magnitude of the system. No periodic
signal was detected but this is certainly attributable to the very large
flickering observed: between 0.07 and 0.1 mag. For V795 Her, the 2.8-hour
modulation, thought to be a superhump arising from the precession of the disc,
is present. We show that this modulation is not stable in terms of periodicity,
amplitude, and phase. Finally, for MCT 2347-3144, a clear modulation is seen in
a first dataset obtained in October 2002. This modulation is absent in August
2003, when the system was brighter and showed much more flickering.",2006-05-05T16:35:26Z
Fluorescent Lyman-alpha Emission from Gas Near a QSO at Redshift 4.28,"We use integral field spectroscopy with the Gemini North Telescope to detect
probable fluorescent Ly-alpha emission from gas lying close to the luminous QSO
PSS 2155+1358 at redshift 4.28. The emission is most likely coming not from
primordial gas, but from a multi-phase, chemically enriched cloud of gas lying
about 50 kpc from the QSO. It appears to be associated with a highly ionised
associated absorber seen in the QSO spectrum. With the exception of this gas
cloud, the environment of the QSO is remarkably free of neutral hydrogen. We
also marginally detect Ly-alpha emission from a foreground sub-Damped-Ly-alpha
absorption-line system.",2006-05-19T01:06:00Z
"3-D Photoionization Structure and Distances of Planetary Nebulae III.
  NGC 6781","Continuing our series of papers on the three-dimensional (3-D) structures of
and accurate distances to Planetary Nebulae (PNe), we present our study of the
planetary nebula NGC6781. For this object we construct a 3-D photoionization
model and, using the constraints provided by observational data from the
literature we determine the detailed 3-D structure of the nebula, the physical
parameters of the ionizing source and the first precise distance. The procedure
consists in simultaneously fitting all the observed emission line morphologies,
integrated intensities and the 2-D density map from the [SII] line ratios to
the parameters generated by the model, and in an iterative way obtain the best
fit for the central star parameters and the distance to NGC6781, obtaining
values of 950+-143pc and 385 Lsun for the distance and luminosity of the
central star respectively. Using theoretical evolutionary tracks of
intermediate and low mass stars, we derive the mass of the central star of
NGC6781 and its progenitor to be 0.60+-0.03 Msun and 1.5+-0.5 Msun
respectively.",2006-04-24T19:47:19Z
"Cold dark matter cosmology conflicts with fluid mechanics and
  observations","Cold dark matter hierarchical clustering (CDMHC) cosmology based on the Jeans
1902 criterion for gravitational instability gives predictions about the early
universe contrary to fluid mechanics and observations. Jeans neglected
viscosity, diffusivity, and turbulence: factors that determine gravitational
structure formation and contradict small structures (CDM halos) forming from
non-baryonic dark matter particle candidates. From hydro-gravitational-dynamics
(HGD) cosmology, viscous-gravitational fragmentation produced supercluster
(10^46 kg), cluster, and galaxy-mass (10^42 kg) clouds in the primordial plasma
with the large fossil density turbulence (rho_o ~ 3x10-17 kg m-3) of the first
fragmentation at 10^12 s, and a protogalaxy linear and spiral clump morphology
reflecting maximum stretching near vortex lines of the plasma turbulence at the
10^13 s plasma-gas transition. Gas protogalaxies fragmented into
proto-globular-star-cluster mass (10^36 kg) clumps of protoplanet gas clouds

"RASS-SDSS Galaxy Cluster Survey. VII. On the Cluster Mass to Light ratio
  and the Halo Occupation Distribution","We explore the mass-to-light ratio in galaxy clusters and its relation to the
cluster mass. We study the relations among the optical luminosity ($L_{op}$),
the cluster mass ($M_{200}$) and the number of cluster galaxies within
$r_{200}$ ($N_{gal}$) in a sample of 217 galaxy clusters with confirmed 3D
overdensity. We correct for projection effects, by determining the galaxy
surface number density profile in our cluster sample. This is best fitted by a
cored King profile in low and intermediate mass systems. The core radius
decreases with cluster mass, and, for the highest mass clusters, the profile is
better represented by a generalized King profile or a cuspy Navarro, Frenk &
White profile. We find a very tight proportionality between $L_{op}$ and
$N_{gal}$, which, in turn, links the cluster mass-to-light ratio to the Halo
Occupation Distribution $N_{gal}$ vs. $M_{200}$. After correcting for
projection effects, the slope of the $L_{op}-M_{200}$ and $N_{gal}-M_{200}$
relations is found to be $0.92\pm0.03$, close, but still significantly less
than unity. We show that the non-linearity of these relations cannot be
explained by variations of the galaxy luminosity distributions and of the
galaxy M/L with the cluster mass. We suggest that the nonlinear relation
between number of galaxies and cluster mass reflects an underlying nonlinear
relation between number of subhaloes and halo mass.",2006-06-12T08:23:50Z
Astrophysical Effects of Scalar Dark Matter Miniclusters,"We model the formation, evolution and astrophysical effects of dark compact
Scalar Miniclusters (``ScaMs''). These objects arise when a scalar field, with
an axion-like or Higgs-like potential, undergoes a second order phase
transition below the QCD scale. Such a scalar field may couple too weakly to
the standard model to be detectable directly through particle interactions, but
may still be detectable by gravitational effects, such as lensing and baryon
accretion by large, gravitationally bound miniclusters. The masses of these
objects are shown to be constrained by the Ly$\alpha$ power spectrum to be less
than $\sim 10^4 M_\odot$, but they may be as light as classical axion
miniclusters, of the order of $10^{-12} M_\odot$. We simulate the formation and
nonlinear gravitational collapse of these objects around matter-radiation
equality using an N-body code, estimate their gravitational lensing properties,
and assess the feasibility of studying them using current and future lensing
experiments. Future MACHO-type variability surveys of many background sources
can reveal either high-amplification, strong lensing events, or measure density
profiles directly via weak-lensing variability, depending on ScaM parameters
and survey depth. However, ScaMs, due to their low internal densities, are
unlikely to be responsible for apparent MACHO events already detected in the
Galactic halo. A simple estimate is made of parameters that would give rise to
early structure formation; in principle, early stellar collapse could be
triggered by ScaMs as early as recombination, and significantly affect cosmic
reionization.",2006-07-14T22:16:38Z
Monte Carlo radiative transfer in protoplanetary disks,"We present a new continuum 3D radiative transfer code, MCFOST, based on a
Monte-Carlo method. MCFOST can be used to calculate (i) monochromatic images in
scattered light and/or thermal emission, (ii) polarisation maps, (iii)
interferometric visibilities, (iv) spectral energy distributions and (v) dust
temperature distributions of protoplanetary disks. Several improvements to the
standard Monte Carlo method are implemented in MCFOST to increase efficiency
and reduce convergence time, including wavelength distribution adjustments,
mean intensity calculations and an adaptive sampling of the radiation field.
The reliability and efficiency of the code are tested against a previously
defined benchmark, using a 2D disk configuration. No significant difference (no
more than 10%, and generally much less) is found between the temperatures and
SEDs calculated by MCFOST and by other codes included in the benchmark. A study
of the lowest disk mass detectable by Spitzer, around young stars, is presented
and the colours of ``representative'' parametric disks are compared to recent
IRAC and MIPS Spitzer colours of solar-like young stars located in nearby star
forming regions.",2006-06-22T08:33:38Z
"The Maximum B-mode Polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background from
  Inhomogeneous Reionization","We compute the B-mode polarization power spectrum of the CMB from an epoch of
inhomogeneous reionization, using a simple model in which HII regions are
represented by ionized spherical bubbles with a log normal distribution of
sizes whose clustering properties are determined by large-scale structure. Both
the global ionization fraction and the characteristic radius of HII regions are
allowed to be free functions of redshift. Models that would produce substantial
contamination to degree scale gravitational wave B-mode measurements have power
that is dominated by the shot noise of the bubbles. Rare bubbles of >100 Mpc at
z>20 can produce signals that in fact exceed the B-modes from gravitational
lensing and are comparable to the maximal allowed signal of gravitational waves
(~0.1uK) while still being consistent with global constraints on the total
optical depth. Even bubbles down to 20 Mpc at z~15, or 40 Mpc at z~10 can be
relevant (0.01uK) once the lensing signal is removed either statistically or
directly. However, currently favored theoretical models that have ionization
bubbles that only grow to such sizes at the very end of a fairly prompt and
late reionization produce signals which are at most at these levels.",2006-07-28T18:31:37Z
"They Came From the Deep in the Supernova: The Origin of TiC and Metal
  Subgrains in Presolar Graphite Grains","A new formation scenario for TiC and Fe,Ni-metal inclusions in presolar
graphite grains of supernova origin is described. The mineralogy and chemistry
require condensation of (Fe,Ni)-titanides from Fe, Ni, and Ti-rich gaseous
ejecta, subsequent carburization to make TiC and metal, and encapsulation into
graphite. Titanides only condense if Si is depleted relative to heavier mass
elements, which requires alpha-rich freeze-out and a deep mass-cut for the
supernova ejecta. This Si-poor core material must remain unmixed with other
supernova zones until the titanides condensed. This can be accomplished by
transport of core ejecta in bipolar jets through the major expanding supernova
zone ejecta. If the jets stall in regions dominated by C-rich ejecta such as
C-He zone where graphite condenses, thermochemically favored in situ
carburization of the titanides - either before or during encapsulation into
condensing graphite - leads to a TiC and metal composite. This scenario agrees
with theoretical models and observations of asymmetric core collapse in
supernovae that are associated with bipolar jets loaded with iron-peak
elements.",2006-06-27T22:54:21Z
The Age and Metallicity Relation of Omega Centauri,"We present a metallicity distribution based on photometry and spectra for 442
omega Cen cluster members that lie at the main sequence turnoff region of the
color-magnitude diagram. This distribution is similar to that found for the red
giant branch. The distribution shows a sharp rise to a mean of [Fe/H] = -1.7
with a long tail to higher metallicities. Ages have then been determined for
the stars using theoretical isochrones enabling the construction of an
age-metallicity diagram. Interpretation of this diagram is complicated by the
correlation of the errors in the metallicities and ages. Nevertheless, after
extensive Monte-Carlo simulations, we conclude that our data show that the
formation of the cluster took place over an extended period of time: the most
metal-rich stars in our sample ([Fe/H] ~ -0.6) are younger by 2-4 Gyrs than the
most metal-poor population.",2006-05-24T05:48:01Z
The acceleration of the universe and the physics behind it,"Using a general classification of dark enegy models in four classes, we
discuss the complementarity of cosmological observations to tackle down the
physics beyond the acceleration of our universe. We discuss the tests
distinguishing the four classes and then focus on the dynamics of the
perturbations in the Newtonian regime. We also exhibit explicitely models that
have identical predictions for a subset of observations.",2006-05-12T08:14:29Z
"A Keck/HIRES Doppler Search for Planets Orbiting Metal-Poor Dwarfs. I.
  Testing Giant Planet Formation and Migration Scenarios","We describe a high-precision Doppler search for giant planets orbiting a
well-defined sample of metal-poor dwarfs in the field. This experiment
constitutes a fundamental test of theoretical predictions which will help
discriminate between proposed giant planet formation and migration models. We
present here details on the survey as well as an overall assessment of the
quality of our measurements, making use of the results for the stars that show
no significant velocity variation.",2006-05-26T15:56:31Z
"The Cosmic Microwave Background and the Ionization History of the
  Universe","Details of how the primordial plasma recombined and how the universe later
reionized are currently somewhat uncertain. This uncertainty can restrict the
accuracy of cosmological parameter measurements from the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB). More positively, future CMB data can be used to constrain the
ionization history using observations. We first discuss how current
uncertainties in the recombination history impact parameter constraints, and
show how suitable parameterizations can be used to obtain unbiased parameter
estimates from future data. Some parameters can be constrained robustly,
however there is clear motivation to model recombination more accurately with
quantified errors. We then discuss constraints on the ionization fraction
binned in redshift during reionization. Perfect CMB polarization data could in
principle distinguish different histories that have the same optical depth. We
discuss how well the Planck satellite may be able to constrain the ionization
history, and show the currently very weak constraints from WMAP three-year
data.",2006-06-22T15:47:37Z
"A Likelihood Method for Measuring the Ultrahigh Energy Cosmic Ray
  Composition","Air fluorescence detectors traditionally determine the dominant chemical
composit ion of the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray flux by comparing the averaged
slant depth of the shower maximum, $X_{max}$, as a function of energy to the
slant depths expect ed for various hypothesized primaries. In this paper, we
present a method to make a direct measurement of the expected mean number of
protons and iron by comparing the shap es of the expected $X_{max}$
distributions to the distribution for data. The advantages of this method
includes the use of information of the full distribution and its ability to
calculate a flux for various cosmic ray compositi ons. The same method can be
expanded to marginalize uncertainties due to choice of spectra, hadronic models
and atmospheric parameters. We demonstrate the technique with independent
simulated data samples from a parent sample of protons and iron. We accurately
predict the number of protons and iron in the parent sample and show that the
uncertainties are meaningful.",2006-04-27T03:59:43Z
"Envelope Expansion with Core Collapse. III. Similarity Isothermal Shocks
  in a Magnetofluid","We explore MHD solutions for envelope expansions with core collapse (EECC)
with isothermal MHD shocks in a quasi-spherical symmetry and outline potential
astrophysical applications of such magnetized shock flows. MHD shock solutions
are classified into three classes according to the downstream characteristics
near the core. Class I solutions are those characterized by free-fall collapses
towards the core downstream of an MHD shock, while Class II solutions are those
characterized by Larson-Penston (LP) type near the core downstream of an MHD
shock. Class III solutions are novel, sharing both features of Class I and II
solutions with the presence of a sufficiently strong magnetic field as a
prerequisite. Various MHD processes may occur within the regime of these
isothermal MHD shock similarity solutions, such as sub-magnetosonic
oscillations, free-fall core collapses, radial contractions and expansions. We
can also construct families of twin MHD shock solutions as well as an
`isothermal MHD shock' separating two magnetofluid regions of two different yet
constant temperatures. The versatile behaviours of such MHD shock solutions may
be utilized to model a wide range of astrophysical problems, including star
formation in magnetized molecular clouds, MHD link between the asymptotic giant
branch phase to the proto-planetary nebula phase with a hot central magnetized
white dwarf, relativistic MHD pulsar winds in supernova remnants, radio
afterglows of soft gamma-ray repeaters and so forth.",2006-04-12T08:11:11Z
"Earth azimuth effect in the bank of search templates for an all sky
  search of the continuous gravitational wave","We study the problem of all sky search in reference to continuous
gravitational wave (CGW) whose wave-form are known in advance. We employ the
concept of Fitting Factor and study the variation in the bank of search
templates with different Earth azimuth at t=0. We found that the number of
search templates varies significantly. Hence, accordingly, the computational
demand for the search may be reduced up to two orders by time shifting the
data.",2006-03-28T05:15:33Z
"On the Age and Metallicity Estimation of Spiral Galaxies Using Optical
  and Near-Infrared Photometry","In integrated-light, some color-color diagrams that use optical and
near-infrared photometry show surprisingly orthogonal grids as age and
metallicity are varied, and they are coming into common usage for estimating
the average age and metallicity of spiral galaxies. In this paper we
reconstruct these composite grids using simple stellar population models from
several different groups convolved with some plausible functional forms of star
formation histories at fixed metallicity. We find that the youngest populations
present (t<2 Gyr) dominate the light, and because of their presence the
age-metallicity degeneracy can be partially broken with broad-band colors,
unlike older populations. The scatter among simple stellar population models by
different authors is, however, large at ages t<2 Gyr. The dominant
uncertainties in stellar population models arise from convective core overshoot
assumptions and the treatment of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch
phase and helium abundance may play a significant role at higher metallicities.
Real spiral galaxies are unlikely to have smooth, exponential star formation
histories, and burstiness will cause a partial reversion to the single-burst
case, which has even larger model-to-model scatter. Finally, it is emphasized
that the current composite stellar population models need some implementation
of chemical enrichment histories for the proper analysis of the observational
data.",2006-05-17T19:29:41Z
Life Products of Stars,"We attempt to document complete energetic transactions of stars in their
life. We calculate photon and neutrino energies that are produced from stars in
their each phase of evolution from 1 to 8 M_sun, using the state-of-the-art
stellar evolution code, tracing the evolution continuously from pre-main
sequence gravitational contraction to white dwarfs. We also catalogue
gravitational and thermal energies and helium, and heavier elements that are
stored in stars and those ejected into interstellar space in each evolutionary
phase.",2006-06-27T09:36:59Z
Can a galaxy redshift survey measure dark energy clustering?,"(abridged) A wide-field galaxy redshift survey allows one to probe galaxy
clustering at largest spatial scales, which carries an invaluable information
on horizon-scale physics complementarily to the cosmic microwave background
(CMB). Assuming the planned survey consisting of z~1 and z~3 surveys with areas
of 2000 and 300 square degrees, respectively, we study the prospects for
probing dark energy clustering from the measured galaxy power spectrum,
assuming the dynamical properties of dark energy are specified in terms of the
equation of state and the effective sound speed c_e in the context of an
adiabatic cold dark matter dominated model. The dark energy clustering adds a
power to the galaxy power spectrum amplitude at spatial scales greater than the
sound horizon, and the enhancement is sensitive to redshift evolution of the
net dark energy density, i.e. the equation of state. We find that the galaxy
survey, when combined with Planck, can distinguish dark energy clustering from
a smooth dark energy model such as the quintessence model (c_e=1), when
c_e<0.04 (0.02) in the case of the constant equation of state w_0=-0.9 (-0.95).
An ultimate full-sky survey of z~1 galaxies allows the detection when c_e<0.08
(0.04) for w_0=0.9 (-0.95). We also investigate a degeneracy between the dark
energy clustering and the non-relativistic neutrinos implied from the neutrino
oscillation experiments, because the two effects both induce a scale-dependent
modification in the galaxy power spectrum shape at largest spatial scales
accessible from the galaxy survey. It is shown that a wider redshift coverage
can efficiently separate the two effects by utilizing the different redshift
dependences, where dark energy clustering is apparent only at low redshifts
z<1.",2006-06-21T20:55:45Z
"An inner disk below the ADAF: the intermediate spectral state of black
  hole accretion","Aims: The hard and soft spectral states of black hole accretion are
understood as connected with ADAF accretion (truncated disk) and standard disk
accretion, respectively. However, observations indicate the existence of cool
gas in the inner region at times when the disk is already truncated outside. We
try to shed light on these not yet understood intermediate states. Methods: The
disk-corona model allows to understand the spectral state transitions as caused
by changes of the mass flow rate in the disk and provides a picture for the
accretion geometry when disk truncation starts at the time of the soft/hard
transition, the formation of a gap in the disk filled by an advection-dominated
flow (ADAF) at the distance where the evaporation is maximal. We study the
interaction of such an ADAF with an inner thin disk below. Results: We show
that, when the accretion rate is not far below the transition rate, an inner
disk could exist below an ADAF, leading to an intermediate state of black hole
accretion.",2006-06-09T04:06:25Z
"Observational evidence for AGN fueling. I. The merging of NGC6104 with a
  companion","We investigate in details the kinematics and morphology of the Seyfert galaxy
NGC6104 in order to identify the mechanism of gas transportation to the active
galactic nucleus (AGN). Our observational data were obtained at the 6-m Special
Astrophysical Observatory telescope with the MPFS integral-field spectrograph
and the SCORPIO universal device in three modes: direct imaging, a scanning
Fabry-Perot interferometer, and long-slit spectroscopy. Images from the HST
archive were invoked to study the structure of the circumnuclear region. An
analysis of deep images has revealed that NGC6104 is in the phase of active
merging with a companion galaxy. We have been able to study the detailed
picture of ionized gas motions up to galactocentric distances of 14 kpc and to
construct the stellar velocity field for the inner region. The radial gas
motions toward the AGN along the central bar play a significant role at
galactocentric distances of 1-5 kpc. In addition, we have detected an outflow
of ionized gas from the nucleus that presumably resulted from the intrusion of
a radio jet into the ambient interstellar medium. Using diagnostic diagrams, we
estimate the contributions from the AGN and star formation to the galactic gas
ionization. We estimate the bar pattern speed by the Tremaine-Weinberg method
and show that the inner ring observed in the galactic images has a resonant
nature. Two possible ring formation scenarios (before and during the
interaction with a companion) are discussed.",2006-07-08T18:36:57Z
"The Abundance of Distant and Extremely Red Galaxies: The Role of AGN
  Feedback in Hierarchical Models","We investigate the effect of AGN feedback associated to the bright QSO phase
onto the color distribution of galaxies from z=0 up to z=4. To this aim, we
insert a blast-wave model of AGN feedback in our semi-analytic model of galaxy
formation, which includes the growth of supermassive black holes and the AGN
activity triggered by interactions of the host galaxies. The AGN feedback is
directly related to the impulsive, luminous quasar phase. We test our model by
checking the consistency of its results against i) the QSO luminosity functions
from z=0 to z=4; ii) the observed local relation between the black hole mass
m_{BH} and the mass of the host galaxy. At low redshift the inclusion of AGN
feedback enhances the number of red bright galaxies, so that the color
distribution of M_r<-22 objects is entirely dominated by red (u-r>1.5)
galaxies; at 0.5< z< 2 it yields rest-frame U-V color distribution in agreement
with existing observations. In the range z=1.5-2.5, we find that 31% of
galaxies contribute to the EROs population with m_K<20 (Vega system); at such a
magnitude, the model yields an EROs surface density of 6.3 10^3 /deg^2 matching
existing data; about 80 % of the above density is contributed by passive
galaxies with old stellar populations. Extending our analysis to z=4, the model
matches the observed surface density 1.5 10^3 /deg^2 of DRGs at m_K=20; such a
population is predicted to be dominated by galaxies with old stellar
populations for z>2.5.",2006-05-04T11:32:59Z
Quasars: What turns them off?,"(Abridged) We explore the idea that the anti-hierarchical turn-off observed
in the quasar population arises from self-regulating feedback, via an outflow
mechanism. Using a detailed hydrodynamic simulation we calculate the luminosity
function of quasars down to a redshift of z=1 in a large, cosmologically
representative volume. Outflows are included explicitly by tracking halo
mergers and driving shocks into the surrounding intergalactic medium. Our
results are in excellent agreement with measurements of the spatial
distribution of quasars, and we detect an intriguing excess of galaxy-quasar
pairs at very short separations. We also reproduce the anti-hierarchical
turnoff in the quasar luminosity function, however, the magnitude of the
turn-off falls short of that observed as well as that predicted by analogous
semi-analytic models. The difference can be traced to the treatment of gas
heating within galaxies. The simulated galaxy cluster L_X-T relationship is
close to that observed for z~1 clusters, but the simulated galaxy groups at z=1
are significantly perturbed by quasar outflows, suggesting that measurements of
X-ray emission in high-redshift groups could well be a ""smoking gun"" for the
AGN heating hypothesis.",2006-06-08T20:52:07Z
"Three-Dimensional Simulations of Spherical Accretion Flows with
  Small-Scale Magnetic Fields","Spherical (nonrotating) accretion flows with small-scale magnetic fields have
been investigated using three-dimensional, time-dependent MHD simulations.
These simulations have been designed to model high-resolution (quasi) steady
accretion flows in a wedge computational domain that represents a small
fraction of the full spherical domain. Subsonic and supersonic
(super-fast-magnetosonic) accretion flows have been considered. Two accretion
regimes have been studied: conservative, or radiatively inefficient, and
nonconservative, in which the heat released in magnetic reconnections is
completely lost. The flows in both regimes are turbulent. They show the
flattened radial density profiles and reduction of the accretion velocities and
mass accretion rates in comparison with hydrodynamic Bondi flows. In the
conservative regime, the turbulence is more intensive and supported mostly by
thermal convection. In the nonconservative regime, the turbulence is less
intensive and supported by magnetic buoyancy and various magnetic interactions.
We have concluded that steady, supersonic spherical accretion cannot be
developed in the presence of small-scale magnetic fields.",2006-06-08T15:01:44Z
Neutrino Oscillation Effects on Supernova Light Element Synthesis,"Neutrino oscillations affect light element synthesis through the
neutrino-process in supernova explosions. The 7Li and 11B yields produced in a
supernova explosion of a 16.2 solar-mass star model increase by factors of 1.9
and 1.3 in the case of large mixing angle solution with normal mass hierarchy
and sin^{2}2theta_{13} > 0.002 compared with those without the oscillations. In
the case of inverted mass hierarchy or nonadiabatic 13-mixing resonance, the
increment of their yields is much smaller. Neutrino oscillations raise the
reaction rates of charged-current neutrino-process reactions in the region
outside oxygen-rich layers. The number ratio of 7Li/11B could be a tracer of
normal mass hierarchy and relatively large theta_{13}, still satisfying
sin^{2}2theta_{13} < 0.1, through future precise observations in stars having
strong supernova component.",2006-06-02T05:22:54Z
Reconstructing holographic quintessence,"The holographic dark energy model is an attempt for probing the nature of
dark energy within the framework of quantum gravity. The dimensionless
parameter $c$ determines the main property of the holographic dark energy. With
the choice of $c\geq 1$, the holographic dark energy can be described
completely by a quintessence scalar field. In this paper, we show this
quintessential description of the holographic dark energy with $c\geq 1$ and
reconstruct the potential of the quintessence as well as the dynamics of the
scalar field.",2006-04-23T07:40:39Z
"Neon Abundances in B-Stars of the Orion Association: Solving the Solar
  Model Problem?","We report on non-LTE Ne abundances for a sample of B-type stellar members of
the Orion Association. The abundances were derived by means of non-LTE fully
metal-blanketed model atmospheres and extensive model atoms with updated atomic
data. We find that these young stars have a very homogeneous abundance of A(Ne)
= 8.27 +/- 0.05. This abundance is higher by ~0.4 dex than currently adopted
solar value, A(Ne)=7.84, which is derived from lines produced in the corona and
active regions. The general agreement between the abundances of C, N, and O
derived for B stars with the solar abundances of these elements derived from
3-D hydrodynamical models atmospheres strongly suggests that the abundance
patterns of the light elements in the Sun and B stars are broadly similar. If
this hypothesis is true, then the Ne abundance derived here is the same within
the uncertainties as the value required to reconcile solar models with
helioseismological observations.",2006-06-29T20:02:50Z
"The Uncorrelated Universe: Statistical Anisotropy and the Vanishing
  Angular Correlation Function in WMAP Years 1-3","The large-angle (low-ell) correlations of the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) as reported by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) after
their first year of observations exhibited statistically significant anomalies
compared to the predictions of the standard inflationary big-bang model. We
suggested then that these implied the presence of a solar system foreground, a
systematic correlated with solar system geometry, or both. We re-examine these
anomalies for the data from the first three years of WMAP's operation. We show
that, despite the identification by the WMAP team of a systematic correlated
with the equinoxes and the ecliptic, the anomalies in the first-year Internal
Linear Combination (ILC) map persist in the three-year ILC map, in all-but-one
case at similar statistical significance. The three-year ILC quadrupole and
octopole therefore remain inconsistent with statistical isotropy -- they are
correlated with each other (99.6% C.L.), and there are statistically
significant correlations with local geometry, especially that of the solar
system. The angular two-point correlation function at scales >60 degrees in the
regions outside the (kp0) galactic cut, where it is most reliably determined,
is approximately zero in all wavebands and is even more discrepant with the
best fit LambdaCDM inflationary model than in the first-year data - 99.97% C.L.
for the new ILC map. The full-sky ILC map, on the other hand, has a
non-vanishing angular two-point correlation function, apparently driven by the
region inside the cut, but which does not agree better with LambdaCDM. The role
of the newly identified low-ell systematics is more puzzling than reassuring.",2006-05-04T20:07:43Z
Revealing the environs of the remarkable southern hot core G327.3-0.6,"We present a submm study of the massive hot core G327.3-0.6 that constrains
its physical parameters and environment. The APEX telescope was used to image
CO and N2H+ emission, to observe lines from other molecules toward a hot and a
cold molecular core, and to measure the continuum flux density of the hot core.
In the C18O J=3-2 line, two clumps were found, one associated with the HII
region G327.3-0.5 and the other associated with the hot core. An additional
cold clump is found 30 arcsec (0.4 pc) northeast of the hot core in bright N2H+
emission. From the the continuum data, we calculate a mass of 420 Msol and a
size of 0.1 pc for the hot core. A new, more accurate position of the hot core
is reported, which allows the association of the core with a bright
mid-infrared source. The luminosity of the hot core is estimated to be between
5 and 15 10^4 Lsol. This study revealed several different evolutionary stages
of massive star formation in the G327.3-0.6 region.",2006-05-26T14:55:39Z
"Dynamical Influences of the Last Magellanic Interaction On the
  Magellanic Clouds","We investigate the present distributions of gas and young stars in the Large
and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC) based on fully self-consistent
numerical simulations of the Clouds for the last ~ 0.8 Gyr. Our principal
results, which can be tested against observations, are as follows. The last
dynamical and hydrodynamical interaction between the Clouds about ~ 0.2 Gyr ago
can form the apparently off-center bar and peculiar HI spirals of the LMC. The
present spatial distributions of young stars with ages less than 20 Myr in the
LMC can be significantly asymmetric and clumpy owing to the interaction. A
small but non-negligible fraction of stellar and gaseous components can be
transferred from the SMC into the LMC during the interaction to form diffuse
halo components around the LMC. The burst of star formation in the SMC can be
synchronized with that of the LMC about 0.2 Gyr ago in some models. New stars
can form from gas in the SMC's tidal tails, one of which can be observed as the
Magellanic Bridge (MB). The metallicity distribution function of new stars in
the MB has a peak of [Fe/H] ~ -0.8, which is significantly smaller than the
stellar metallicity of the SMC. Based on these results, we discuss the origin
of 30 Doradus, the southern molecular ridge of the LMC, the globular cluster
ESO 121-SC03, metal-poor inter-Cloud stars within the MB, and giant HI holes of
the LMC.",2006-03-30T07:21:24Z
"Multi-wavelength properties of the high-energy bright Seyfert 1 galaxy
  IGR J18027-1455","A new sample of hard X-ray sources in the Galactic Plane is being revealed by
the regular observations performed by the INTEGRAL satellite. The full
characterization of these sources is mandatory to understand the hard X-ray
sky. Here we report new multifrequency radio, infrared and optical observations
of the source IGR J18027-1455, as well as a multi-wavelength study from radio
to hard X-rays. The radio counterpart of IGR J18027-1455 is not resolved at any
observing frequency. The radio flux density is well fitted by a simple power
law with a spectral index alpha=-0.75+/-0.02. This value is typical of
optically thin non-thermal synchrotron emission originated in a jet. The NIR
and optical spectra show redshifted emission lines with z=0.034, and a broad
Halpha line profile with FWHM ~3400 km/s. This suggests an Active Galactic
Nucleus (AGN) of type 1 as the optical counterpart of IGR J18027-1455. We
confirm the Seyfert 1 nature of the source, which is intrinsically bright at
high energies both in absolute terms and when scaled to a normalized 6 cm
luminosity. Finally, comparing its X-ray luminosity with isotropic indicators,
we find that the source is Compton thin and AGN dominated. This indicates that
INTEGRAL might have just seen the tip of the iceberg, and several tens of such
sources should be unveiled during the course of its lifetime.",2006-06-28T20:07:40Z
The stellar halo and outer disk of M33,"We present first results from a Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopic survey of red giant
branch (RGB) stars in M33. The radial velocity distributions of the stars in
our fields are well described by three Gaussian components, corresponding to a
candidate halo component with an uncorrected radial velocity dispersion of
sigma ~ 50km/s, a candidate disk component with a dispersion sigma ~ 16km/s,
and a third component offset from the disk by ~ 50km/s, but for which the
dispersion is not well constrained. By comparing our data to a model of M33
based upon its HI rotation curve, we find that the stellar disk is offset in
velocity by ~ 25km/s from the HI disk, consistent with the warping which exists
between these components. The spectroscopic metallicity of the halo component
is [Fe/H] ~ -1.5, significantly more metal-poor than the implied metallicity of
the disk population ([Fe/H] ~ -0.9), which also has a broader colour dispersion
than the halo population. These data represent the first detections of
individual stars in the halo of M33 and, despite being ~ 10 times less massive
than M31 or the Milky Way, all three of these disk galaxies have stellar halo
components with a similar metallicity. The color distribution of the third
component is different to the disk and the halo, but is similar to that
expected for a single, coeval, stellar population, and could represent a
stellar stream. More observations are required to determine the true nature of
this intriguing third kinematic component in M33.",2006-06-29T16:09:30Z
"Discovery of Very High Energy Gamma-Ray Emission from the BL Lac Object
  H2356-309 with the H.E.S.S. Cherenkov Telescopes","The extreme synchrotron BL Lac object H2356-309, located at a redshift of z =
0.165, was observed from June to December 2004 with a total exposure of approx.
40 h live-time with the H.E.S.S. (High Energy Stereoscopic System) array of
atmospheric-Cherenkov telescopes (ACTs). Analysis of this data set yields, for
the first time, a strong excess of 453 gamma-rays (10 standard deviations above
background) from H2356-309, corresponding to an observed integral flux above
200 GeV of I(>200GeV) = (4.1+-0.5) 10^12 cm^-2.s^-1 (statistical error only).
The differential energy spectrum of the source between 200 GeV and 1.3 TeV is
well-described by a power law with a normalisation (at 1 TeV) of N_0 = (3.00 +-
0.80_stat +- 0.31_sys) 10^-13 cm^-2.s^-1.TeV^-1 and a photon index of Gamma =
3.09 +- 0.24_stat +- 0.10_sys. H2356-309 is one of the most distant BL Lac
objects detected at very-high-energy gamma-rays so far. Results from
simultaneous observations from ROTSE-III (optical), RXTE (X-rays) and NRT
(radio) are also included and used together with the H.E.S.S. data to constrain
a single-zone homogeneous synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model. This model
provides an adequate fit to the H.E.S.S. data when using a reasonable set of
model parameters.",2006-07-25T19:25:02Z
"On the Physics of Type I X-ray Bursts on Accreting Neutron Stars at High
  Accretion Rates","We investigate the effect of the hot CNO cycle breakout reaction
15O(alpha,gamma)19Ne on the occurrence of type I X-ray bursts on accreting
neutron stars. For f_rp <~ 0.1, where f_rp is a dimensionless factor by which
we multiply the 15O(alpha,gamma)19Ne reaction rate of Caughlan & Fowler (1988),
our model predicts that bursts should occur only for accretion rates below a
critical value of approximately 0.3 times the Eddington limit. This agrees with
observations. For larger values of f_rp, including the standard choice f_rp =
1, the model switches to a new regime in which bursts occur all the way up to
roughly the Eddington limit. Since the latter regime disagrees with
observations, we suggest that the true 15O(alpha,gamma)19Ne reaction rate is
lower than usually assumed.",2006-08-02T20:12:54Z
"The Distances to Open Clusters from Main-Sequence Fitting. III. Improved
  Accuracy with Empirically Calibrated Isochrones","We continue our series of papers on open cluster distances with a critical
assessment of the accuracy of main-sequence fitting using isochrones that
employ empirical corrections to the color-temperature relations. We use four
nearby open clusters with multicolor photometry and accurate metallicities and
present a new metallicity for Praesepe ([Fe/H] = +0.11 +/- 0.03) from
high-resolution spectra. The internal precision of distance estimates is about
a factor of 5 better than the case without the color calibrations. After taking
into account all major systematic errors, we obtain distances accurate to about
2%-3% when there exists a good metallicity estimate. Metallicities accurate to
better than 0.1 dex may be obtained from BVIcKs photometry alone. We also
derive a helium abundance for the Pleiades of Y = 0.279 +/- 0.015, which is
equal within the errors to the Sun's initial helium abundance and that of the
Hyades. Our best estimates of distances are (m - M)_0 = 6.33 +/- 0.04, 8.03 +/-
0.04, and 9.61 +/- 0.03 to Praesepe, NGC 2516, and M67, respectively. Our
Pleiades distance at the spectroscopic metallicity, (m - M)_0 = 5.66 +/- 0.01
(internal) +/- 0.05 (systematic), is in excellent agreement with several
geometric distance measurements. We have made calibrated isochrones for -0.3 <=
[Fe/H] <= +0.2 available at http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/iso/ .",2006-07-24T20:32:25Z

"Ion dynamics and the magnetorotational instability in weakly-ionized
  discs","The magnetorotational instability (MRI) of a weakly ionized, differentially
rotating, magnetized plasma disk is investigated in the multi-fluid framework.
The disk is threaded by a uniform vertical magnetic field and charge is carried
by electrons and ions only. The inclusion of ion dynamics causes significant
modification to the conductivity tensor in a weakly ionized disk. The parallel,
Pedersen and Hall component of conductivity tensor become time dependent
quantities resulting in the AC and DC part of the conductivity. The
conductivity may change sign leading to the significant modification of the
parameter window in which MRI may operate.
  The effect of ambipolar and Hall diffusion on the linear growth of the MRI is
examined in the presence of time dependent conductivity tensor. We find that
the growth rate in ambipolar regime can become somewhat larger than the
rotational frequency, especially when the departure from ideal MHD is
significant. Further, the instability operates on large scale lengths. This has
important implication for the angular momentum transport in the disk.",2006-04-24T01:03:35Z
The Formation and Evolution of Intracluster Light,"Using N-body simulations, we have modeled the production and evolution of
diffuse, low surface brightness intracluster light (ICL) in three simulated
galaxy clusters. Using an observational definition of ICL to be luminosity at a
surface brightness mu_V>26.5 mag/sq.arcsec, we have found that the fraction of
cluster luminosity contained in ICL generally increases as clusters evolve,
although there are large deviations from this trend over short timescales,
including sustained periods of decreasing ICL luminosity. Most ICL luminosity
increases come in short, discrete events which are highly correlated with group
accretion events within the cluster. In evolved clusters we find that ~10-15%
of the clusters' luminosity is at ICL surface brightness. The morphological
structure of the ICL changes with time, evolving from a complex of filaments
and small-scale, relatively high surface brightness features early in a
cluster's history, to a more diffuse and amorphous cluster-scale ICL envelope
at later times. Finally, we also see a correlation between the evolution of ICL
at different surface brightnesses, including a time delay between the evolution
of faint and extremely faint surface brightness features which is traced to the
differing dynamical timescales in the group and cluster environment.",2006-05-23T21:20:16Z
Absolute timing of the Crab Pulsar at optical wavelengths with STJs,"We have observed the Crab Pulsar in the optical with S-Cam, an instrument
based on Superconducting Tunneling Junctions (STJs) with $\mu$s time
resolution. Our aim was to study the delay between the radio and optical pulse.
The Crab Pulsar was observed three times over a time span of almost 7 years, on
two different locations, using three different versions of the instrument, and
using two different GPS units. We consistently find that the optical peak leads
the radio peak by 49$\pm$90, 254$\pm$170, and 291$\pm$100 $\mu$s. On assumption
of a constant optical lead, the weighted-average value is $\sim$170 $\mu$s, or
when rejecting (based on a perhaps questionable radio ephemeris) the first
measurement, 273$\pm$100 $\mu$s.",2006-06-07T12:08:14Z
The effect of planetary migration on the corotation resonance,"The migration of a planet through a gaseous disc causes the locations of
their resonant interactions to drift and can alter the torques exerted between
the planet and the disc. We analyse the time-dependent dynamics of a
non-coorbital corotation resonance under these circumstances. The ratio of the
resonant torque in a steady state to the value given by Goldreich & Tremaine
(1979) depends essentially on two dimensionless quantities: a dimensionless
turbulent diffusion time-scale and a dimensionless radial drift speed. When the
drift speed is comparable to the libration speed and the viscosity is small,
the torque can become much larger than the unsaturated value in the absence of
migration, but is still proportional to the large-scale vortensity gradient in
the disc. Fluid that is trapped in the resonance and drifts with it acquires a
vortensity anomaly relative to its surroundings. If the anomaly is limited by
viscous diffusion in a steady state, the resulting torque is inversely
proportional to the viscosity, although a long time may be required to achieve
this state. A further, viscosity-independent, contribution to the torque comes
from fluid that streams through the resonant region. In other cases, torque
oscillations occur before the steady value is achieved. We discuss the
significance of these results for the evolution of eccentricity in
protoplanetary systems. We also describe the possible application of these
findings to the coorbital region and the concept of runaway (or type III)
migration. [Abridged]",2006-05-04T20:46:32Z
V838 Mon and M31-RV: The Stellar Populations Angle,"Insight into the origin of unusual events like the eruption of V838 Mon can
be obtained from studies of the stellar populations from which they arise. V838
Mon lies in an intriguing region of the Galaxy, toward the warped outer edge of
the disk, with significant contributions from the Galactic thick disk and the
recently discovered Monoceros tidal stream. The initial distance measures
placed V838 Mon in a jumbled region of the Galaxy but the recent shorter
distances make it highly likely that V838 Mon was a thin disk star -- likely in
a spiral arm -- consistent with the recent detection of a young cluster in the
vicinity. We compare V838 Mon to M31-RV, a red variable that erupted in the
bulge of M31 in 1988 and had a peak luminosity and spectral evolution very
similar to V838 Mon. Archival HST images show no nebulosity or unusual stars at
M31-RV's projected location. Moreover, the only stellar population in the field
is a canonic old bulge population. This indicates that whatever the origin of
the red novae, the mechanism is likely independent of age and progenitor mass.
In particular, the B3V star seen in V838 Mon it not a necessary part of the
eruption mechanism.",2006-07-05T21:37:01Z
"The Araucaria Project: Distance to the Local Group Galaxy NGC 3109 from
  Near-Infrared Photometry of Cepheids","We present near-infrared J- and K-band photometry of 77 Cepheid variables in
the Local Group galaxy NGC 3109. Combining our data with the previously
published optical V- and I-band photometry of Cepheids in this galaxy we derive
an accurate distance and interstellar reddening to NGC 3109. Adopting a
distance modulus of 18.5 mag for the Large Magellanic Cloud, we obtain a true
distance modulus to NGC 3109 of (m-M)_0 = 25.571 +- 0.024 mag (random error),
corresponding to a distance of 1.30 +- 0.02 Mpc. The systematic uncertainty on
this value (apart from the adopted LMC distance) is of the order of +-3%, the
main contributors to this value being the uncertainty on the photometric zero
points, and the effect of blending with unresolved companion stars. The total
reddening determined from our multiwavelength solution is E(B-V)=0.087 +- 0.012
mag. About half of the reddening is produced internal to NGC 3109. Our distance
result is consistent with previous determinations of the distance to NGC 3109,
but has significantly reduced error bars.",2006-05-10T01:01:33Z
Cosmological Acceleration: Dark Energy or Modified Gravity?,"We review the evidence for recently accelerating cosmological expansion or
""dark energy"", either a negative pressure constituent in General Relativity
(Dark Energy) or modified gravity (Dark Gravity), without any Dark Energy
constituent. If constituent Dark Energy does not exist, so that our universe is
now dominated by pressure-free matter, Einstein gravity must be modified at low
curvature. The vacuum symmetry of any Robertson-Walker universe then
characterizes Dark Gravity as low- or high-curvature modifications of Einstein
gravity. The dynamics of either kind of ""dark energy"" cannot be derived from
the homogeneous expansion alone, but requires also observing the growth of
inhomogeneities. Present and projected observations are all consistent with a
small fine tuned cosmological constant, with nearly static Dark Energy, or with
gravity modified at cosmological scales. The growth of cosmological
fluctuations will potentially distinguish static ""dark energy"" from dynamic
""dark energy"" with equation of state $w(z)$ either changing rapidly or tracking
the background matter. But to cosmologically distinguish $\Lambda$CDM from
modified gravity will require a weak lensing shear survey more ambitious than
any now projected. Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati modifications of Einstein gravity
may also be detected in refined bservations in the solar system or at the
intermediate Vainstein scale.
  Dark Energy's epicyclic character, failure to explain the original Cosmic
Coincidence (""Why now?"") without fine tuning, inaccessibility to laboratory or
solar system tests, along with braneworld theories, now motivate future
precision solar system, Vainstein-scale and cosmological-scale studies of Dark
Gravity.",2006-05-08T14:38:52Z
"The Sun's Journey Through the Local Interstellar Medium: The PaleoLISM
  and Paleoheliosphere","Over the recent past, the galactic environment of the Sun has differed
substantially from today. Sometime within the past ~130,000 years, and possibly
as recent as ~56,000 years ago, the Sun entered the tenuous tepid partially
ionized interstellar material now flowing past the Sun. Prior to that, the Sun
was in the low density interior of the Local Bubble. As the Sun entered the
local ISM flow, we passed briefly through an interface region of some type. The
low column densities of the cloud now surrounding the solar system indicate
that heliosphere boundary conditions will vary from opacity considerations
alone as the Sun moves through the cloud. These variations in the interstellar
material surrounding the Sun affected the paleoheliosphere.",2006-06-30T14:55:02Z
"A test on external Compton models for $γ$-ray active galactic
  nuclei","There is clear evidence that the $\gamma$-ray emission from active galactic
nuclei (AGNs) is attributed to the inverse Compton scatterings in the
relativistic blobs near the massive black holes. If the soft seed photons are
from the regions outside the blobs, a linear relation between $(\nu
F_{\nu,\gamma}/\nu F_{\nu, \rm syn} u^{*})^{1/(1+\alpha)}$ and Doppler factor
$\delta$ is expected, where $\nu F_{\nu,\gamma}$ and $\nu F_{\nu, \rm syn}$ are
monochromatic $\gamma$-ray and synchrotron fluxes, respectively, and $u^{*}$ is
the energy density of soft seed photons \citep{D97}. We estimate the soft
photon energy density in the relativistic blobs contributed by the broad line
region (BLRs) in these $\gamma$-ray AGNs using their broad-line emission data.
The Doppler factors $\delta$ are derived from their radio core and X-ray
emission data, based on the assumption that the X-ray emission is produced
through synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) scatterings. We find two nearly linear
correlations: $(\nu F_{\nu,\gamma}/\nu F_{\rm opt} u^{*})^{1/(1+\alpha)}
\propto \delta^{1.09}$, and $(\nu F_{\nu,\gamma}/\nu F_{\rm IR}
u^{*})^{1/(1+\alpha)} \propto \delta^{1.20}$, which are roughly consistent with
the linear correlation predicted by the theoretical model for external Compton
scatterings. Our results imply that the soft seed photons are dominantly from
the BLRs in these $\gamma$-ray AGNs.",2006-04-03T08:23:29Z
"Chemical Abundances in the Secondary Star of the Black Hole Binary V4641
  Sagittarii (SAX J1819.3-2525)","We report on detailed spectroscopic studies performed for the secondary star
in the black hole binary (micro-quasar) V4641 Sgr in order to examine its
surface chemical composition and to see if its surface shows any signature of
pollution by ejecta from a supernova explosion. High-resolution spectra of
V4641 Sgr observed in the quiescent state in the blue-visual region are
compared with those of the two bright well-studied B9 stars (14 Cyg and $\nu$
Cap) observed with the same instrument. The effective temperature of V4641 Sgr
(10500 $\pm$ 200 K) is estimated from the strengths of He~{\sc i} lines, while
its rotational velocity, $\it v$ sin $\it i$ (95 $\pm$ 10 km s${}^{-1}$), is
estimated from the profile of the Mg~{\sc ii} line at 4481 \AA. We obtain
abundances of 10 elements and find definite over-abundances of N (by 0.8 dex or
more) and Na (by 0.8 dex) in V4641 Sgr. From line-by-line comparisons of eight
other elements (C, O, Mg, Al, Si, Ti, Cr, and Fe) between V4641 Sgr and the two
reference stars, we conclude that there is no apparent difference in the
abundances of these elements between V4641 Sgr and the two normal late B-type
stars, which have been reported to have solar abundances. An evolutionary model
of a massive close binary system has been constructed to explain the abundances
observed in V4641 Sgr. The model suggests that the progenitor of the black hole
forming supernova was as massive as ~ 35 Msun on the main-sequence and, after
becoming a ~ 10 Msun He star, underwent ""dark"" explosion which ejected only N
and Na-rich outer layer of the He star without radioactive $^{56}$Ni.",2006-07-03T04:29:30Z
"Can MOND take a bullet? Analytical comparisons of three versions of MOND
  beyond spherical symmetry","A proper test of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) in systems of non-trivial
geometries depends on modelling subtle differences in several versions of its
postulated theories. This is especially important for lensing and dynamics of
barely virialised galaxy clusters with typical gravity of scale $\sim a_0 \sim
1\AA{\rm s}^{-2}$. The original MOND formula, the classical single field
modification of the Poisson equation, and the multi-field general relativistic
theory of Bekenstein (TeVeS) all lead to different predictions as we stray from
spherical symmetry. In this paper, we study a class of analytical MONDian
models for a system with a semi-Hernquist baryonic profile. After presenting
the analytical distribution function of the baryons in spherical limits, we
develop orbits and gravitational lensing of the models in non-spherical
geometries. In particular, we can generate a multi-centred baryonic system with
a weak lensing signal resembling that of the merging galaxy cluster 1E 0657-56
with a bullet-like light distribution. We finally present analytical scale-free
highly non-spherical models to show the subtle differences between the single
field classical MOND theory and the multi-field TeVeS theory.",2006-06-09T14:48:15Z
Heliospheric Response to Different Possible Interstellar Environments,"At present, the heliosphere is embedded in a warm low density interstellar
cloud that belongs to a cloud system flowing through the local standard of rest
with a velocity near ~18 km/s. The velocity structure of the nearest
interstellar material (ISM), combined with theoretical models of the local
interstellar cloud (LIC), suggest that the Sun passes through cloudlets on
timescales of < 10^3 - 10^4 yr, so the heliosphere has been, and will be,
exposed to different interstellar environments over time. By means of a
multi-fluid model that treats plasma and neutral hydrogen self-consistently,
the interaction of the solar wind with a variety of partially ionized ISM is
investigated, with the focus on low density cloudlets such as are currently
near the Sun. Under the assumption that the basic solar wind parameters
remain/were as they are today, a range of ISM parameters (from cold neutral to
hot ionized, with various densities and velocities) is considered. In response
to different interstellar boundary conditions, the heliospheric size and
structure change, as does the abundance of interstellar and secondary neutrals
in the inner heliosphere, and the cosmic ray level in the vicinity of Earth.
Some empirical relations between interstellar parameters and heliospheric
boundary locations, as well as neutral densities, are extracted from the
models.",2006-07-26T18:19:15Z
Gravitational instability via the Schrodinger equation,"We explore a novel approach to the study of large-scale structure formation
in which self-gravitating cold dark matter (CDM) is represented by a complex
scalar field whose dynamics are governed by coupled Schrodinger and Poisson
equations. We show that, in the quasi-linear regime, the Schrodinger equation
can be reduced to the free-particle Schrodinger equation. We advocate using the
free-particle Schrodinger equation as the basis of a new approximation method -
the free-particle approximation - that is similar in spirit to the successful
adhesion model. In this paper we test the free-particle approximation by
appealing to a planar collapse scenario and find that our results are in
excellent agreement with those of the Zeldovich approximation, provided care is
taken when choosing a value for the effective Planck constant in the theory. We
also discuss how extensions of the free-particle approximation are likely to
require the inclusion of a time-dependent potential in the Schrodinger
equation. Since the Schrodinger equation with a time-dependent potential is
typically impossible to solve exactly, we investigate whether standard
quantum-mechanical approximation techniques can be used, in a cosmological
setting, to obtain useful solutions of the Schrodinger equation. In this paper
we focus on one particular approximation method: time-dependent perturbation
theory (TDPT). We elucidate the properties of perturbative solutions of the
Schrodinger equation by considering a simple example: the gravitational
evolution of a plane-symmetric density fluctuation. We use TDPT to calculate an
approximate solution of the relevant Schrodinger equation and show that this
perturbative solution can be used to successfully follow gravitational collapse
beyond the linear regime, but there are several pitfalls to be avoided.",2006-04-29T18:13:24Z
Gaseous Tidal Debris found in the NGC 3783 Group,"We have conducted wide-field HI mapping of a ~5.5 x 5.5 degree region
surrounding the NGC 3783 galaxy group, to an HI mass limit of ~4 x 10^8 Msun.
The observations were made using the multibeam system on the Parkes 64-m
radiotelescope, as part of the Galaxy Evolution Multiwavelength Study (GEMS).
We find twelve HI detections in our Parkes data, four more than catalogued in
HIPASS. We find two new group members, and discover an isolated region of HI
gas with an HI mass of ~4 x 10^8 Msun, without a visible corresponding optical
counterpart. We discuss the likelihood of this HI region being a low surface
brightness galaxy, primordial gas, or a remnant of tidal debris. For the NGC
3783 group we derive a mean recession velocity of 2903 km/s, and a velocity
dispersion of 190 km/s. The galaxy NGC 3783 is the nearest galaxy to the
luminosity weighted centre of the group, and is at the group mean velocity.
  From the X-ray and dynamical state of this galaxy group, this group appears
to be in the early stages of its evolution.",2006-06-20T00:39:39Z
Protecting Life in the Milky Way: Metals Keep the GRBs Away,"The host galaxies of the five local, z<0.25, long-duration gamma-ray bursts,
each of which had a well-documented associated supernova, are all faint and
metal-poor compared to the population of local star-forming galaxies. We
quantify this statement by using a previous analysis of star-forming galaxies
(z<0.2) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to estimate the fraction of local
star formation as a function of host galaxy oxygen abundance. We find that only
a small fraction (<25%) of current star formation occurs in galaxies with
oxygen abundance 12+log(O/H)<8.6, i.e., about half that of the Milky Way.
However, all five low-z GRB hosts have oxygen abundance below this limit, in
three cases very significantly so. If GRBs traced local star formation
independent of metallicity, the probability of obtaining such low abundances
for all five hosts would be P~0.1%. We conclude that GRBs trace only
low-metallicity star formation, and that the Milky Way has been too metal rich
to host long GRBs for at least the last several billion years. This result has
implications for the potential role of GRBs in mass extinctions, for searches
for recent burst remnants in the Milky Way and other large galaxies, for
non-detections of late radio emission from local core-collapse supernovae, and
for the production of cosmic rays in the local Universe. We also find that the
isotropic energy release of these five GRBs, E_iso, steeply decreases with
increasing host oxygen abundance, suggesting an upper metallicity limit for
``cosmological'' GRBs at ~0.15 Z_solar. (Abridged)",2006-04-06T17:04:08Z
"A population of high-redshift type-2 quasars-I. Selection Criteria and
  Optical Spectra","We discuss the relative merits of mid-infrared and X-ray selection of type-2
quasars. We describe the mid-infrared, near-infrared and radio selection
criteria used to find a population of redshift z~2 type-2 quasars which we
previously argued suggests that most supermassive black hole growth in the
Universe is obscured (Martinez-Sansigre et al., 2005). We present the optical
spectra obtained from the William Herschel Telescope, and we compare the narrow
emission line luminosity, radio luminosity and maximum size of jets to those of
objects from radio-selected samples. This analysis suggests that these are
genuine radio-quiet type-2 quasars, albeit the radio-bright end of this
population. We also discuss the possibility of two different types of quasar
obscuration, which could explain how the ~2-3:1 ratio of type-2 to type-1
quasars preferred by modelling our population can be reconciled with the ~1:1
ratio predicted by unified schemes.",2006-04-18T15:11:24Z
Probing Neutrino Dark Energy with Extremely High-Energy Cosmic Neutrinos,"Recently, a new non-Standard Model neutrino interaction mediated by a light
scalar field was proposed, which renders the big-bang relic neutrinos of the
cosmic neutrino background a natural dark energy candidate, the so-called
Neutrino Dark Energy. As a further consequence of this interaction, the
neutrino masses become functions of the neutrino energy densities and are thus
promoted to dynamical, time/redshift dependent quantities. Such a possible
neutrino mass variation introduces a redshift dependence into the resonance
energies associated with the annihilation of extremely high-energy cosmic
neutrinos on relic anti-neutrinos and vice versa into Z-bosons. In general,
this annihilation process is expected to lead to sizeable absorption dips in
the spectra to be observed on earth by neutrino observatories operating in the
relevant energy region above 10^13 GeV. In our analysis, we contrast the
characteristic absorption features produced by constant and varying neutrino
masses, including all thermal background effects caused by the relic neutrino
motion. We firstly consider neutrinos from astrophysical sources and secondly
neutrinos originating from the decomposition of topological defects using the
appropriate fragmentation functions. On the one hand, independent of the nature
of neutrino masses, our results illustrate the discovery potential for the
cosmic neutrino background by means of relic neutrino absorption spectroscopy.
On the other hand, they allow to estimate the prospects for testing its
possible interpretation as source of Neutrino Dark Energy within the next
decade by the neutrino observatories ANITA and LOFAR.",2006-06-13T14:59:19Z
The clustering of narrow-line AGN in the local Universe,"We have analyzed the clustering of ~ 90,000 narrow-line AGN drawn from the
Data Release 4 (DR4) of the SDSS. We compute the cross-correlation between AGN
and a reference sample of galaxies, and compare this to results for control
samples of inactive galaxies matched simultaneously in redshift,stellar
mass,concentration, velocity dispersion and the 4000A break strength. We also
compare near-neighbour counts around AGN and around the control galaxies. On
scales larger than a few Mpc, AGN have almost the same clustering amplitude as
the control sample. This demonstrates that AGN host galaxies and inactive
galaxies populate dark matter halos of similar mass.On scales between 100kpc
and 1Mpc,AGN are clustered more weakly than the control galaxies. We use mock
catalogues constructed from high-resolution N-body simulations to interpret
this anti-bias, showing that the observed effect is easily understood if AGN
are preferentially located at the centres of their dark matter halos. On scales
less than 70 kpc, AGN cluster marginally more strongly than the control sample,
but the effect is weak. When compared to the control sample, we find that only
one in a hundred AGN has an extra neighbour within a radius of 70 kpc. This
excess increases as a function of the accretion rate onto the black hole, but
it does not rise above the few percent level. Although interactions between
galaxies may be responsible for triggering nuclear activity in a minority of
nearby AGN, some other mechanism is required to explain the activity seen in

  the Dwarf Galaxies of the Local Group","Context: The Hubble tuning fork diagram has always been the preferred scheme
for classification of galaxies. It is based on morphology only. At the
opposite, biologists have long taken into account the genealogical relatedness
of living entities for classification purposes. Aims: Assuming branching
evolution of galaxies as a 'descent with modification', we show here that the
concepts and tools of phylogenetic systematics widely used in biology can be
heuristically transposed to the case of galaxies. Methods: This approach that
we call ""astrocladistics"" is applied to Dwarf Galaxies of the Local Group and
provides the first evolutionary tree for real galaxies. Results: The trees that
we present here are sufficiently solid to support the existence of a
hierarchical organization in the diversity of dwarf galaxies of the Local
Group. This also shows that these galaxies all derive from a common ancestral
kind of objects. We find that some kinds of dIrrs are progenitors of both dSphs
and other kinds of dIrrs.We also identify three evolutionary groups, each one
having its own characteristics and own evolution. Conclusions: The present work
opens a new way to analyze galaxy evolution and a path towards a new
systematics of galaxies. Work on other galaxies in the Universe is in progress.",2006-05-09T12:02:22Z
Occam's razor meets WMAP,"Using a variety of quantitative implementations of Occam's razor we examine
the low quadrupole, the ``axis of evil'' effect and other detections recently
made appealing to the excellent WMAP data. We find that some razors {\it fully}
demolish the much lauded claims for departures from scale-invariance. They all
reduce to pathetic levels the evidence for a low quadrupole (or any other low
$\ell$ cut-off), both in the first and third year WMAP releases. The ``axis of
evil'' effect is the only anomaly examined here that survives the humiliations
of Occam's razor, and even then in the category of ``strong'' rather than
``decisive'' evidence. Statistical considerations aside, differences between
the various renditions of the datasets remain worrying.",2006-04-19T16:00:05Z
Capture Rates of Compact Objects by Supermassive Black Holes,"Capture rates of compact objects were calculated by using a recent solution
of the Fokker-Planck equation in energy-space, including two-body resonant
effects. The fraction of compact objects (white dwarfs, neutron stars and
stellar black holes) was estimated as a function of the luminosity of the
galaxy from a new grid of evolutionary models. Stellar mass densities at the
influence radius of central supermassive black holes were derived from
brightness profiles obtained by Hubble Space Telescope observations. The
present study indicates that the capture rates scale as $\propto
M_{bh}^{-1.048}$, consequence of the fact that dwarf galaxies have denser
central regions than luminous objects. If the mass distribution of supermassive
black holes has a lower cutoff at $\sim 1.4\times 10^6$ M$_{\odot}$
(corresponding to the lowest observed supermassive black hole mass, located in
M32), then 9 inspiral events are expected to be seen by LISA (7-8 corresponding
to white dwarf captures and 1-2 to neutron star and stellar black hole
captures) after one year of operation. However, if the mass distribution
extends down to $\sim 2\times 10^5$ M$_{\odot}$, then the total number of
expected events increases up to 579 (corresponding to $\sim$ 274 stellar black
hole captures, $\sim$ 194 neutron star captures and $\sim$ 111 white dwarf
captures).",2006-06-18T07:38:32Z
Analysis of White Dwarfs with Strange-Matter Cores,"We summarize masses and radii for a number of white dwarfs as deduced from a
combination of proper motion studies, Hipparcos parallax distances, effective
temperatures, and binary or spectroscopic masses. A puzzling feature of these
data is that some stars appear to have radii which are significantly smaller
than that expected for a standard electron-degenerate white-dwarf equations of
state. We construct a projection of white-dwarf radii for fixed effective mass
and conclude that there is at least marginal evidence for bimodality in the
radius distribution forwhite dwarfs. We argue that if such compact white dwarfs
exist it is unlikely that they contain an iron core. We propose an alternative
of strange-quark matter within the white-dwarf core. We also discuss the impact
of the so-called color-flavor locked (CFL) state in strange-matter core
associated with color superconductivity. We show that the data exhibit several
features consistent with the expected mass-radius relation of strange dwarfs.
We identify eight nearby white dwarfs which are possible candidates for strange
matter cores and suggest observational tests of this hypothesis.",2006-04-17T22:36:44Z
"From Radio to X-ray: The Quiescent Atmosphere of the dMe Flare Star EV
  Lacertae","We report on multi-wavelength observations spanning radio to X-ray
wavelengths of the M dwarf flare star, EV Lacertae, probing the characteristics
of the outer atmospheric plasma from the upper chromosphere to the corona. We
detect the star at a wavelength of 2 cm (15 GHz) for the first time. UV and FUV
line profiles show evidence of nonthermal broadening, and the velocity width
appear to peak at lower temperatures than in the Sun; this trend is confirmed
in another active M dwarf flare star. Electron density measurements indicate
nearly constant electron pressures between $\log T=$5.2 and 6.4. At higher
coronal temperatures, there is a sharp increase of two orders of magnitude in
density (n$_{e}\sim10^{13}$ cm$^{-3}$ at $\log T=$6.9). X-ray, EUV, FUV and NUV
spectra constrain the DEM from the upper chromosphere through the corona. The
coronal pressures are inconsistent with the assumption of hydrostatic
equilibrium, either through EM modeling or application of scaling laws, and
imply large conductive loss rates and a large energy input at the highest
temperatures. The timescales for radiative and conductive losses in EV Lac's
upper atmosphere imply that significant continued heating must occur for the
corona to maintain its quiescent properties. The high frequency radio detection
requires the high temperature X-ray-emitting coronal plasma to be spatially
distinct from the radio emission source. Length scales in the low-temperature
corona are markedly larger than those in the high-temperature corona, further
suggestions of an inhomogeneous mixture of thermal and nonthermal coronal
plasma.",2006-04-11T21:36:57Z
"Extended inverse-Compton emission from distant, powerful radio galaxies","We present Chandra observations of two relatively high redshift FRII radio
galaxies, 3C 432 and 3C 191 (z=1.785 and z=1.956 respectively), both of which
show extended X-ray emission along the axis of the radio jet or lobe. This
X-ray emission is most likely to be due to inverse-Compton scattering of Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Under this assumption we estimate the
minimum energy contained in the particles responsible. This can be extrapolated
to determine a rough estimate of the total energy. We also present new, deep
radio observations of 3C 294, which confirm some association between radio and
X-ray emission along the NE-SW radio axis and also that radio emission is not
detected over the rest of the extent of the diffuse X-ray emission. This,
together with the offset between the peaks of the X-ray and radio emissions may
indicate that the jet axis in this source is precessing.",2006-06-09T16:52:29Z
"Recipes for stellar jets: results of combined optical/infrared
  diagnostics","We examine the conditions of the plasma along a sample of 'classical'
Herbig-Haro jets located in the Orion and Vela star forming regions, through
combined optical-infrared spectral diagnostics. Our sample includes HH 111, HH
34, HH 83, HH 73, HH 24 C/E, HH 24 J, observed at moderate spatial/spectral
resolution. The obtained spectra cover a wide wavelength range from 0.6-2.5 um,
including many transitions from regions of different excitation conditions.
This allows us to probe the density and temperature stratification which
characterises the cooling zones behind the shock fronts along the jet. The
derived physical parameters (such as the extinction, the electron density and
temperature, the ionisation fraction, and the total density) are used to
estimate the depletion onto dust grains of Calcium and Iron with respect to
solar abundances. This turns out to be between 70% and 0% for Ca and ~90% for
Fe, suggesting that the weak shocks present in the beams are not capable of
completely destroying the dust grains. We then derive the mass flux rates
(Mdot_jet is on average 5 10^-8 M_solar yr^-1) and the associated linear
momentum fluxes. The latter are higher than, or of the same order as, those
measured in the coaxial molecular flows, suggesting that the flows are jet
driven. Finally, we discuss differences between jets in our sample.",2006-06-12T20:21:07Z
Very Cool Close Binaries,"We present new observations of cool <6000K and low mass <1Msun binary systems
that have been discovered by searching several modern stellar photometric
databases. The search has led to a factor of 10 increase in the number of known
cool close eclipsing binary systems.",2006-03-28T03:19:54Z
INTEGRAL observations of AGN obscured by the Galactic Plane,"In this paper we present INTEGRAL observations of 7 AGNs: two newly
discovered type 1 Seyferts, IGR J18027-1455 and IGR J21247+5058, and five well
known Seyferts, NGC 6814 (type 1.5), Cyg A (Type 2), MCG-05-23-16 (type 2), ESO
103-G035 (type2) and GRS1734-292. For IGR J18027-1455 and IGR J21247+5058 only
INTEGRAL/IBIS data were available, while broadband spectra are presented and
discussed for the remaining 5 sources for which either BeppoSAX or ASCA data
were used in conjunction with INTEGRAL measurements. In the cases of NGC 6814
and GRS 1734-292, data taken in different periods indicate variability in the
flux: in the case of NGC 6814 by a factor of 16 over a period of about 10
years. Although limited in size, our sample can be used to investigate the
parameter space of both the photon index and cut-off energy. The mean photon
index is 1.8, while the cut-off energy ranges from 30-50 keV to greater than
200 keV; in the particular case of MCG-05-23-16, ESO 103-G035 and GRS 1734-292
the cut-off energy is well constrained at or below 100 keV. We have also tested
an enlarged sample, which includes INTEGRAL data of 3 more AGNs, against the
correlation found by a number of authors between the photon index and the
cut-off energy but have found no evidence for a relation between these two
parameters. Our analysis indicates that there is a diversity in cut-off
energies in the primary continuum of Seyfert galaxies.",2006-06-20T15:23:16Z
Dark energy parameterizations and their effect on dark halos,"There is a plethora of dark energy parameterizations that can fit current
supernovae Ia data. However, this data is only sensitive to redshifts up to
order one. In fact, many of these parameterizations break down at higher
redshifts. In this paper we study the effect of dark energy models on the
formation of dark halos. We select a couple of dark energy parameterizations
which are sensible at high redshifts and compute their effect on the evolution
of density perturbations in the linear and non-linear regimes. Using the
Press-Schechter formalism we show that they produce distinguishable signatures
in the number counts of dark halos. Therefore, future observations of galaxy
clusters can provide complementary constraints on the behavior of dark energy.",2006-04-04T18:04:17Z
"Rolling down from the 30 keV peak: modelling the hard X-ray and
  gamma-ray backgrounds","We will briefly discuss the importance of sensitive X-ray observations above
a few tens of keV for a better understanding of the physical mechanisms

and radio loud AGN and to the cosmological evolution of the most obscured
sources.",2006-04-25T16:52:44Z
A Genuine Intermediate-Age Globular Cluster in M33,"We present deep integrated-light spectroscopy of nine M33 globular clusters
taken with the Hectospec instrument at the MMT Observatory. Based on our
spectroscopy and previous deep color-magnitude diagrams obtained with
HST/WFPC2, we present evidence for the presence of a genuine intermediate-age
globular cluster in M33. The analysis of Lick line indices indicates that all
globular clusters are metal-poor ([Z/H] <~ -1.0) and that cluster M33-C38 is
about 5-8 Gyr younger than the rest of the sample M33 star clusters. We find no
evidence for a population of blue horizontal branch stars in the CMD of
M33-C38, which rules out the possibility of an artificially young spectroscopic
age due to the presence of hot stars. We infer a total mass of 5-9 x 10^4 M_sol
for M33-C38, which implies that M33-C38 has survived ~2-3 times longer than
some dynamical evolution model predictions for star clusters in M33, although
it is not yet clear to which dynamical component of M33 - thin disk, thick
disk, halo - the cluster is associated.",2006-06-19T17:49:23Z
Enhanced polarization of CMB from thermal gravitational waves,"If inflation was preceded by a radiation era then at the time of inflation
there will exist a decoupled thermal distribution of gravitons. Gravitational
waves generated during inflation will be amplified by the process of stimulated
emission into the existing thermal distribution of gravitons. Consequently the
usual zero temperature scale invariant tensor spectrum is modified by a
temperature dependent factor. This thermal correction factor amplify the
$B$-mode polarization of the CMB by an order of magnitude at large angles,
which may now be in the range of observability of WMAP.",2006-07-04T12:17:05Z
GLAST Tracker,"The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Gamma-ray Large-Area Space
Telescope (GLAST) is a pair-conversion gamma-ray detector designed to explore
the gamma-ray universe in the 20 MeV-300 GeV energy band. The Tracker subsystem
of the LAT will perform tracking of electron and positrons to determine the
origin of the gamma-ray. The design and performance of the GLAST LAT Tracker
are described in this paper.",2006-05-02T01:02:06Z
Updating reionization scenarios after recent data,"The recent release of data on (i) high redshift source counts from NICMOS
HUDF, and (ii) electron scattering optical depth from 3-year WMAP, require a
re-examination of reionization scenarios. Using an improved self-consistent
model, based on Choudhury & Ferrara (2005), we determine the range of
reionization histories which can match a wide variety of data sets
simultaneously. From this improved analysis we find that hydrogen reionization
starts around z = 15, driven by the metal-free stars (with normal Salpeter-like
IMF), and is 90% complete by z = 10. The photoionizing power of PopIII stars
fades for z < 10 because of the concomitant action of radiative and chemical
feedbacks, which causes the reionization process to stretch considerably and to
end only by z = 6. The combination of different data sets still favours a
non-zero contribution from metal-free stars, forming with efficiencies > 2%.",2006-03-23T15:10:22Z
"Deep Near-Infrared Imaging af an Embedded Cluster in the Extreme Outer
  Galaxy: Census of Supernovae Triggered Star Formation","While conducting a near-infrared (NIR) survey of ``Digel Clouds'', which are
thought to be located in the extreme outer Galaxy (EOG), Kobayashi & Tokunaga
found star formation activity in ``Cloud 2'', a giant molecular cloud at the
Galactic radius of ~ 20 kpc. Additional infrared imaging showed two embedded
young clusters at the densest regions of the molecular cloud. Because the
molecular cloud is located in the vicinity of a supernova remnant (SNR) HI
shell, GSH 138-01-94, it was suggested that the star formation activity in
Cloud 2 was triggered by this expanding HI shell. We obtained deep J (1.25 um),
H (1.65 um) and K (2.2 um) images of one of the embedded clusters in Cloud 2
with high spatial resolution (FWHM ~0"".3) and high sensitivity (K ~ 20 mag, 10
sigma). We identified 52 cluster members. The estimated stellar density (~ 10
pc^{-2}) suggests that the cluster is a T-association. This is the deepest NIR
imaging of an embedded cluster in the EOG. The observed K-band luminosity
function (KLF) suggests that the underlying initial mass function (IMF) of the
cluster down to the detection limit of ~ 0.1 M_sun is not significantly
different from the typical IMFs in the field and in the near-by star clusters.
The overall characteristics of this cluster appears to be similar to those of
other embedded clusters in the far outer Galaxy. The estimated age of the
cluster from the KLF, which is less than 1 Myr, is consistent with the view
that the star formation was triggered by the HI shell whose age was estimated
at 4.3 Myr (Stil & Irwin). The 3-dimensional geometry of SNR shell, molecular
cloud and the embedded cluster, which is inferred from our data, as well as the
cluster age strongly suggest that the star formation in Cloud 2 was triggered
by the SNR shell.",2006-06-01T11:49:08Z
"Theory for the Secondary Eclipse Fluxes, Spectra, Atmospheres, and Light
  Curves of Transiting Extrasolar Giant Planets","We have created a general methodology for calculating the
wavelength-dependent light curves of close-in extrasolar giant planets (EGPs)
as they traverse their orbits. Focussing on the transiting EGPs HD189733b,
TrES-1, and HD209458b, we calculate planet/star flux ratios during secondary
eclipse and compare them with the Spitzer data points obtained so far in the
mid-infrared. We introduce a simple parametrization for the redistribution of
heat to the planet's nightside, derive constraints on this parameter (P_n), and
provide a general set of predictions for planet/star contrast ratios as a
function of wavelength, model, and phase. Moreover, we calculate average
dayside and nightside atmospheric temperature/pressure profiles for each
transiting planet/P_n pair with which existing and anticipated Spitzer data can
be used to probe the atmospheric thermal structure of severely irradiated EGPs.
We find that the baseline models do a good job of fitting the current secondary
eclipse dataset, but that the Spitzer error bars are not yet small enough to
discriminate cleanly between all the various possibilities.",2006-07-02T21:28:36Z
Tracing Quasar Accretion Rates at Higher Redshifts,"In this work we connect some measurable properties of the CIV1549 emission
line with the quasar accretion rates (Eddington ratios). A tight correlation is
found for a sample of more than a hundred nearby objects, suggesting a possible
method for a relatively accurate estimate of the Eddington ratio of
high-redshift quasars, at least for the radio-quiet ones. This paper further
confirms the existing notion that the CIV changes (shifts) are mostly driven by
the accretion rate.",2006-06-26T09:52:55Z
Evidence for Heating of Neutron Stars by Magnetic Field Decay,"We show the existence of a strong trend between neutron star surface
temperature and the dipolar component of the magnetic field extending through
three orders of field magnitude, a range that includes magnetars, radio-quiet
isolated neutron stars, and many ordinary radio pulsars. We suggest that this
trend can be explained by the decay of currents in the crust over a time scale
of few Myr. We estimate the minimum temperature that a NS with a given magnetic
field can reach in this interpretation.",2006-07-26T07:38:09Z
"Constraining dark matter halo profiles and galaxy formation models using
  spiral arm morphology. I. Method outline","We investigate the use of spiral arm pitch angles as a probe of disk galaxy
mass profiles. We confirm our previous result that spiral arm pitch angles (P)
are well-correlated with the rate of shear (S) in disk galaxy rotation curves,
by using a much larger sample (51 galaxies) than used previously (17 galaxies).
We use this correlation to argue that imaging data alone can provide a powerful
probe of galactic mass distributions out to large lookback times. In contrast
to previous work, we show that observed spiral arm pitch angles are similar
when measured in the optical (at 0.4 um) and the near-infrared (at 2.1 um) with
a mean difference of 2.3+/-2.7 degrees. This is then used to strengthen the
known correlation between P and S using B-band images. We then use two example
galaxies to demonstrate how an inferred shear rate coupled with a bulge-disk
decomposition model and a Tully-Fisher derived velocity normalization can be
used to place constraints on a galaxy's baryon fraction and dark matter halo
profile. We show that ESO 582-G12, a galaxy with a high shear rate (slightly
declining rotation curve) at ~10 kpc, favors an adiabatically contracted halo,
with high initial NFW concentration (c_vir > 16) and a high fraction of halo
baryons in the form of stars (~15-40%). In contrast, IC 2522 has a low shear
rate (rising rotation curve) at ~10 kpc and favors non-adiabatically contracted
models with low NFW concentrations (c_vir ~ 2-8) and a low stellar baryon
fraction <10%.",2006-03-22T22:18:32Z
A Catalog of Emission line profiles for Planetary Nebulae,"Using the Cloudy_3D code (Morisset, this conference), we run a set of models
to build a catalog of emission line profiles of PNe. The goal is to cover the
main morphologies (spherical, ellipsoidal, bipolar, thin or thick shells) and
to compute profiles changing the orientation of the nebula, the expansion
velocity law (including or not turbulence), the position/size of the aperture.
The results is a huge set of profiles and PV-diagrams that can be compared to
observations as a help to derive morpho-kinematical properties of real objects.",2006-05-16T20:14:42Z
Dwarf novae in the Hamburg Quasar Survey: Rarer than expected,"We report the discovery of five new dwarf novae from the Hamburg Quasar
Survey (HQS), and discuss the properties of the sample of dwarf novae in the
HQS. The orbital periods of the new dwarf novae are ~105.1 min or ~109.9 min,
114.3+-2.7 min, 92.66+-0.17 min, 272.317+-0.001 min, 258.02+-0.56 min for
HS0417+7445, HS1016+3412, HS1340+1524, HS1857+7127, and HS2214+2845,
respectively. HS1857+7127 is found to be partially eclipsing. In HS2214+2845
the secondary star of spectral type M3+-1 is clearly detected, and we estimate
the distance to the system to be d=390+-40 pc. We recorded one superoutburst of
the SU UMa system HS0417+7445. HS1016+3412 and HS1340+1524 have rare outbursts,
and their subtype is yet undetermined. HS1857+7127 frequently varies in
brightness and may be a Z Cam-type dwarf nova. HS2214+2845 is a U Gem-type
dwarf nova with a most likely cycle length of 71 d. To date, 14 new dwarf novae
have been identified in the HQS. The ratio of short-period (<3 h) to
long-period (>3 h) systems of this sample is 1.3, much smaller compared to the
ratio of 2.7 found for all known dwarf novae. The HQS dwarf novae display
typically infrequent or low-amplitude outburst activity, underlining the
strength of spectroscopic selection in identifying new CVs independently of
their variability. The spectroscopic properties of short-period CVs in the HQS
suggest that most of them are still evolving towards the minimum period. Their
total number agrees with the predictions of population models within an order
of magnitude. However, the bulk of all CVs is predicted to have evolved past
the minimum period, and those systems remain unidentified. Those post-bounce
systems may have markedly weaker Hbeta emission lines compared to the average
known short-period CVs, and probably undergo no or extremely rare outbursts.",2006-05-23T14:06:20Z
Outflows driven by Giant Protoplanets,"We investigate outflows driven by a giant protoplanet using three-dimensional
MHD nested grid simulations. We consider a local region around the protoplanet
in the protoplanetary disk, and calculate three models: (a) unmagnetized disk
model, (b) magnetized disk model having magnetic field azimuthally parallel to
the disk, and (c) magnetic field perpendicular to the disk. Outflows with
velocities, at least, 10 km/s are driven by the protoplanets in both magnetized
disk models, while outflow does not appear in unmagnetized disk model.
Tube-like outflows along the azimuthal direction of the protoplanetary disk
appear in model with magnetic field being parallel to the disk. In this model,
the magnetically dominated regions (i.e., density gap) are clearly contrasted
from other regions and spiral waves appear near the protoplanet. On the other
hand, in model with magnetic field being perpendicular to the disk, outflows
are driven by a protoplanet with cone-like structure just as seen in the
outflow driven by a protostar. Magnetic field lines are strongly twisted near
the protoplanet and the outflows have well-collimated structures in this
model.These outflows can be landmarks for searching exo-protoplanets in their
formation stages. Our results indicate that the accretion rate onto the
protoplanet tend to have a larger value than that expected from previous
hydrodynamical calculations, since a fraction of the angular momentum of
circum-planetary disk is removed by outflows, enhanced non-axisymmetric
patterns caused by magnetic field, and magnetic braking. Possible implications
for observation are also briefly discussed.",2006-04-28T01:28:43Z
"Tempo2, a new pulsar timing package. II: The timing model and precision
  estimates","Tempo2 is a new software package for the analysis of pulsar pulse times of
arrival. In this paper we describe in detail the timing model used by tempo2,
and discuss limitations on the attainable precision. In addition to the
intrinsic slow-down behaviour of the pulsar, tempo2 accounts for the effects of
a binary orbital motion, the secular motion of the pulsar or binary system,
interstellar, Solar system and ionospheric dispersion, observatory motion
(including Earth rotation, precession, nutation, polar motion and orbital
motion), tropospheric propagation delay, and gravitational time dilation due to
binary companions and Solar system bodies. We believe the timing model is
accurate in its description of predictable systematic timing effects to better
than one nanosecond, except in the case of relativistic binary systems where
further theoretical development is needed. The largest remaining sources of
potential error are measurement error, interstellar scattering, Solar system
ephemeris errors, atomic clock instability and gravitational waves.",2006-07-31T01:46:28Z
Substructure in lensing clusters and simulations,"We present high-resolution mass reconstructions for five massive
cluster-lenses spanning a redshift range from $z = 0.18$--0.57 utilising
archival {\it Hubble Space Telescope} ({\it HST}) data and applying
galaxy-galaxy lensing techniques. These detailed mass models were obtained from
the observations by combining constraints from the strong and weak lensing
regimes. We ascribe local weak distortions in the shear maps to perturbations
induced by the presence of galaxy haloes around individual bright early-type
cluster member galaxies. This technique constrains the mass enclosed within an
aperture for these subhaloes. We are sensitive to a specific mass range for
these subhaloes, $10^{11}$ -- $10^{12.5} \msun$, which we associate with
galaxy-scale subhaloes. Adopting a parametric model for the subhaloes, we also
derive their velocity dispersion function and the aperture radius function. The
mass spectrum of substructure in the inner regions of the observed clusters is
directly compared with that in simulated clusters extracted from the {\it
Millennium Simulation}. The massfunction, aperture radii and velocity
dispersion function are compared in detail. Overall, we find good agreement
between the distribution of substructure properties retrieved using the lensing
analysis and those obtained from the simulation (truncated abstract).",2006-04-19T20:03:13Z
Cosmic Reionization Redux,"We show that numerical simulations of reionization that resolve the Lyman
Limit systems (and, thus, correctly count absorptions of ionizing photons) have
converged to about 10% level for 5<z<6.2 and are in reasonable agreement
(within 10%) with the SDSS data in this redshift interval. The SDSS data thus
constraint the redshift of overlap of cosmic HII regions to z_{OVL} =
6.1+-0.15. At higher redshifts, the simulations are far from convergence on the
mean Gunn-Peterson optical depth, but achieve good convergence for the mean
neutral hydrogen fraction. The simulations that fit the SDSS data, however, do
not have nearly enough resolution to resolve the earliest episodes of star
formation, and are very far from converging on the precise value of the optical
depth to Thompson scattering - any value between 6 and 10% is possible,
depending on the convergence rate of the simulations and the fractional
contribution of PopIII stars. This is generally consistent with the third-year
WMAP results, but much higher resolution simulation are required to come up
with the sufficiently precise value for the Thompson optical depth that can be
statistically compared with the WMAP data.",2006-03-29T15:42:03Z
"The Virgo CO Survey: VI. Gas Dynamics and Star Formation Along the Bar
  in NGC 4303","We present CO interferometer observations of the barred galaxy NGC 4303
(M61). This galaxy has a gas concentration at the central region and offset
ridges in the bar. Sharp velocity gradients are apparent across the ridges.
Analyses of the CO data and the newborn stellar clusters revealed in HST images
indicate the existence of unresolved molecular clouds with masses of
10^4-6Msun. The observed shear velocity gradient across the ridges is too small
to break up giant molecular clouds. Therefore, the clouds are likely to survive
passage through the ridges. We discuss a cloud orbit model in a bar potential.
The model reproduces the narrow offset ridges and sharp velocity gradients
across the ridges in NGC 4303. We discuss cloud-cloud collisions (and close
interactions) as a possible triggering mechanism for star formation. The
newborn stellar clusters in NGC 4303 are located predominantly at the leading
sides of the offset ridges, where cloud orbits are densely populated and
suggest a high collisional frequency and possibly a high rate of triggered star
formation. Cloud-based dynamics is less dissipative than smooth hydrodynamic
models, possibly extending the timescales of gas dynamical evolution and gas
fueling to central regions in barred galaxies.",2006-03-11T23:29:45Z
"XMM-Newton observations of the supernova remnant IC443: I. soft X-ray
  emission from shocked interstellar medium","The shocked interstellar medium around IC443 produces strong X-ray emission
in the soft energy band (E<1.5 keV). We present an analysis of such emission as
observed with the EPIC MOS cameras on board the XMM-Newotn observatory, with
the purpose to find clear signatures of the interactions with the interstellar
medium (ISM) in the X-ray band, which may complement results obtained in other
wavelenghts. We found that the giant molecular cloud mapped in CO emission is
located in the foreground and gives an evident signature in the absorption of
X-rays. This cloud may have a torus shape and the part of torus interacting
with the IC443 shock gives rise to 2MASS-K emission in the southeast. The
measured density of emitting X-ray shocked plasma increases toward the
northeastern limb, where the remnant is interacting with an atomic cloud. We
found an excellent correlation between emission in the 0.3-0.5 keV band and
bright optical/radio filament on large spatial scales. The partial shell
structure seen in this band therefore traces the encounter with the atomic
cloud.",2006-06-13T13:15:33Z
A Panoramic Mid-infrared Survey of Two Distant Clusters,"(abridged) We present panoramic Spitzer MIPS 24um observations covering
9x9Mpc (25'x25') fields around two massive clusters, Cl0024+16 and MS0451-03,
at z=0.39 and z=0.55. Our observations cover a very wide range of environments
within these clusters, from high-density regions around the cores out to the
turn-around radius. Cross-correlating the mid-infrared catalogs with deep
optical and near-infrared imaging of these fields, we investigate the
optical/near-infrared colors of the mid-infrared sources. We find excesses of
mid-infrared sources with optical/near-infrared colors expected of cluster
members in the two clusters and test this selection using spectroscopically
confirmed 24um members. The much more significant excess is associated with
Cl0024+16, whereas MS0451-03 has comparatively few mid-infrared sources. The
mid-infrared galaxy population in Cl0024+16 appears to be associated with dusty
star-forming galaxies (typically redder than the general cluster population by
up to A_V~1-2 mags) rather than emission from dusty tori around active galactic
nuclei (AGN) in early-type hosts. The inferred total-infrared star-formation
rates in Cl0024+16 are typically >5x greater than those found from a similar
Halpha survey, indicating significant obscured activity in the cluster
population. We find evidence for strong evolution of the level of dust-obscured
star-formation in dense environments out to z=0.5, analogous to the rise in
fraction of optically-selected star-forming galaxies seen in clusters and the
field out to similar redshifts. However, there are clearly significant
cluster-to-cluster variations in the populations of mid-infrared sources,
probably reflecting differences in the intracluster media and recent dynamical
evolution of these systems.",2006-06-06T11:06:54Z
Simulation studies of CZT Detectors as Gamma-Ray Calorimeter,"We describe the results of detailed 3-D Monte Carlo simulations of a ""CZT
calorimeter"" that can be used to detect photons in the keV to several MeV
range. Several astrophysics applications require the detection of photons in
the energy range of keV up to several MeV with good position and energy
resolution. For certain applications Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) detectors
might be the detector option of choice. Up to now, CZT detectors have mainly
been used in the energy range between a few keV to ~1 MeV, we describe the
results of detailed 3-D Monte Carlo simulations of a ""CZT calorimeter"" that can
be used to detect photons in the keV to several MeV range. The main objective
of these studies is to evaluate the feasibility of CZT calorimeters, to study
their performance and detect and understand performance limiting factors. Such
a calorimeter consists of many layers of closely packed pixellated CZT detector
units. Our simulations of single detector units reproduce experimental results,
indicating that our simulations capture the main factors that limit the
performance of a detector unit. Overall the conclusion of our simulation study
is that between 1 cm and 1.5 cm thick detector units can be used to build a
calorimeter with good performance over the energy range from ~20 keV to ~10
MeV.",2006-06-12T16:06:30Z
"An inner disk below the ADAF: the intermediate spectral state of black
  hole accretion","Aims: The hard and soft spectral states of black hole accretion are
understood as connected with ADAF accretion (truncated disk) and standard disk
accretion, respectively. However, observations indicate the existence of cool
gas in the inner region at times when the disk is already truncated outside. We
try to shed light on these not yet understood intermediate states. Methods: The
disk-corona model allows to understand the spectral state transitions as caused
by changes of the mass flow rate in the disk and provides a picture for the
accretion geometry when disk truncation starts at the time of the soft/hard
transition, the formation of a gap in the disk filled by an advection-dominated
flow (ADAF) at the distance where the evaporation is maximal. We study the
interaction of such an ADAF with an inner thin disk below. Results: We show
that, when the accretion rate is not far below the transition rate, an inner
disk could exist below an ADAF, leading to an intermediate state of black hole
accretion.",2006-06-09T04:06:25Z
Asymmetric Spatiotemporal Evolution of Prebiotic Homochirality,"The role of asymmetry on the evolution of prebiotic homochirality is
investigated in the context of autocatalytic polymerization reaction networks.
A model featuring enantiometric cross-inhibition and chiral bias is used to
study the diffusion equations controlling the spatiotemporal development of
left and right-handed domains. Bounds on the chiral bias are obtained
consistent with present-day constraints on the emergence of life on early
Earth. The viability of biasing mechanisms such as weak neutral currents and
circularly polarized UV light is discussed. The results can be applied to any
hypothetical planetary platform.",2006-06-23T16:24:12Z
No Astrophysical Dyadospheres,"It is shown how pair production itself would prevent the astrophysical
formation of dyadospheres, hypothetical regions where the electric field
exceeds the critical value for rapid Schwinger pair production. Pair production
is a self-regulating process that would discharge a growing electric field, in
the example of a hypothetical collapsing charged stellar core, before it
reached 6% of the minimum dyadosphere value, keeping the pair production rate
more than 26 orders of magnitude below the dyadosphere value, and keeping the
efficiency below 0.0002(M/M_sun)^{1/2}.",2006-05-18T17:41:09Z
"Formation and Collapse of Nonaxisymmetric Protostellar Cores in Planar
  Magnetic Interstellar Clouds: Formulation of the Problem and Linear Analysis","We formulate the problem of the formation and collapse of nonaxisymmetric
protostellar cores in weakly ionized, self-gravitating, magnetic molecular
clouds. In our formulation, molecular clouds are approximated as isothermal,
thin (but with finite thickness) sheets. We present the governing dynamical
equations for the multifluid system of neutral gas and ions, including
ambipolar diffusion, and also a self-consistent treatment of thermal pressure,
gravitational, and magnetic (pressure and tension) forces. The dimensionless
free parameters characterizing model clouds are discussed. The response of
cloud models to linear perturbations is also examined, with particular emphasis
on length and time scales for the growth of gravitational instability in
magnetically subcritical and supercritical clouds. We investigate their
dependence on a cloud's initial mass-to-magnetic-flux ratio (normalized to the
critical value for collapse), the dimensionless initial neutral-ion collision
time, and also the relative external pressure exerted on a model cloud. Among
our results, we find that nearly-critical model clouds have significantly
larger characteristic instability lengthscales than do more distinctly sub- or
supercritical models. Another result is that the effect of a greater external
pressure is to reduce the critical lengthscale for instability. Numerical
simulations showing the evolution of model clouds during the linear regime of
evolution are also presented, and compared to the results of the dispersion
analysis. They are found to be in agreement with the dispersion results, and
confirm the dependence of the characteristic length and time scales on
parameters such as the initial mass-to-flux ratio and relative external
pressure.",2006-07-27T18:27:31Z
"On the role of continuum-driven eruptions in the evolution of very
  massive stars and Population III stars","We suggest that the mass lost during the evolution of very massive stars may
be dominated by optically thick, continuum-driven outbursts or explosions,
instead of by steady line-driven winds. In order for a massive star to become a
WR star, it must shed its H envelope, but new estimates of the effects of
clumping in winds indicate that line driving is vastly insufficient. We discuss
massive stars above roughly 40-50 Msun, for which the best alternative is mass
loss during brief eruptions of luminous blue variables (LBVs). Our clearest
example of this phenomenon is the 19th century outburst of eta Car, when the
star shed 12-20 Msun or more in less than a decade. Other examples are
circumstellar nebulae of LBVs, extragalactic eta Car analogs (``supernova
impostors''), and massive shells around SNe and GRBs. We do not yet fully
understand what triggers LBV outbursts, but they occur nonetheless, and present
a fundamental mystery in stellar astrophysics. Since line opacity from metals
becomes too saturated, the extreme mass loss probably arises from a
continuum-driven wind or a hydrodynamic explosion, both of which are
insensitive to metallicity. As such, eruptive mass loss could have played a
pivotal role in the evolution and fate of massive metal-poor stars in the early
universe. If they occur in these Population III stars, such eruptions would
profoundly affect the chemical yield and types of remnants from early SNe and
hypernovae.",2006-06-07T20:35:57Z
The yield of air fluorescence induced by electrons,"The fluorescence yield for dry air and pure nitrogen excited by electrons is
calculated using a combination of well-established molecular properties and
experimental data of the involved cross sections. Particular attention has been
paid to the role of secondary electrons from ionization processes. At high
pressure and high energy, observed fluorescence turns out to be proportional to
the ionization cross section which follows the Born-Bethe law. Predictions on
fluorescence yields in a very wide interval of electron energies (eV - GeV) and
pressures (1 and 1013 hPa) as expected from laboratory measurements are
presented. Experimental results at energies over 1 MeV are in very good
agreement with our calculations for pure nitrogen while discrepancies of about
20% are found for dry air, very likely associated to uncertainties in the
available data on quenching cross sections. The relationship between
fluorescence emission, stopping power and deposited energy is discussed.",2006-04-24T18:25:38Z
Challenges in optics for Extremely Large Telescope instrumentation,"We describe and summarize the optical challenges for future instrumentation
for Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs). Knowing the complex instrumental
requirements is crucial for the successful design of 30-60m aperture
telescopes. After all, the success of ELTs will heavily rely on its
instrumentation and this, in turn, will depend on the ability to produce large
and ultra-precise optical components like light-weight mirrors, aspheric
lenses, segmented filters, and large gratings. New materials and manufacturing
processes are currently under study, both at research institutes and in
industry. In the present paper, we report on its progress with particular
emphasize on volume-phase-holographic gratings, photochromic materials,
sintered silicon-carbide mirrors, ion-beam figuring, ultra-precision surfaces,
and free-form optics. All are promising technologies opening new degrees of
freedom to optical designers. New optronic-mechanical systems will enable
efficient use of the very large focal planes. We also provide exploratory
descriptions of ""old"" and ""new"" optical technologies together with suggestions
to instrument designers to overcome some of the challenges placed by ELT
instrumentation.",2006-03-28T13:26:29Z
CS 30322-023: an ultra metal-poor TP-AGB star?,"With [Fe/H] = -3.5, CS 30322-023 is the most metal-poor star to exhibit a
clear s-process signature and the most metal-poor ``lead star'' known. CS
30322-023 is also remarkable in having the lowest surface gravity (log g <=
-0.3) among the metal-poor stars studied to date. The available evidence
indicates that this star is presently a thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant
branch (TP-AGB) star, with no strong indication of binarity thus far (although
a signal of period 192 d is clearly present in the radial-velocity data, this
is likely due to pulsation of the stellar envelope). We show that low-mass
TP-AGB stars are not expected to be exceedingly rare in a magnitude-limited
sample such as the HK survey, because their high luminosities make it possible
to sample them over a very large volume. The strong N overabundance and the low
12C/13C ratio (4) in this star is typical of the operation of the CN cycle.
Coupled with a Na overabundance and the absence of a strong C overabundance,
this pattern seems to imply that hot-bottom burning operated in this star,
which should then have a mass of at least 2 Msun. However, the luminosity
associated with this mass would put the star at a distance of about 50 kpc, in
the outskirts of the galactic halo. We explore alternative scenarios in which
the observed abundance pattern results from some mixing mechanism yet to be
identified occurring in a single low-metallicity 0.8 Msun AGB star, or from
pollution by matter from an intermediate-mass AGB companion which has undergone
hot-bottom burning. We stress, however, that our abundances may be subject to
uncertainties due to NLTE or 3D granulation effects which were not taken into
consideration.",2006-05-26T09:23:28Z
"Envelope Expansion with Core Collapse. III. Similarity Isothermal Shocks
  in a Magnetofluid","We explore MHD solutions for envelope expansions with core collapse (EECC)
with isothermal MHD shocks in a quasi-spherical symmetry and outline potential
astrophysical applications of such magnetized shock flows. MHD shock solutions
are classified into three classes according to the downstream characteristics
near the core. Class I solutions are those characterized by free-fall collapses
towards the core downstream of an MHD shock, while Class II solutions are those
characterized by Larson-Penston (LP) type near the core downstream of an MHD
shock. Class III solutions are novel, sharing both features of Class I and II
solutions with the presence of a sufficiently strong magnetic field as a
prerequisite. Various MHD processes may occur within the regime of these
isothermal MHD shock similarity solutions, such as sub-magnetosonic
oscillations, free-fall core collapses, radial contractions and expansions. We
can also construct families of twin MHD shock solutions as well as an
`isothermal MHD shock' separating two magnetofluid regions of two different yet
constant temperatures. The versatile behaviours of such MHD shock solutions may
be utilized to model a wide range of astrophysical problems, including star
formation in magnetized molecular clouds, MHD link between the asymptotic giant
branch phase to the proto-planetary nebula phase with a hot central magnetized
white dwarf, relativistic MHD pulsar winds in supernova remnants, radio
afterglows of soft gamma-ray repeaters and so forth.",2006-04-12T08:11:11Z
Galaxy number counts in a presence of the graviton background,"In the model of low-energy quantum gravity by the author, cosmological
redshifts are caused by interactions of photons with gravitons. Non-forehead
collisions with gravitons will lead to an additional relaxation of any photonic
flux. Using only the luminosity distance and a geometrical one as functions of
a redshift in this model, theoretical predictions for galaxy number counts are
considered here. The Schechter luminosity function with $\alpha =-2.43$ is
used. The considered model provides a good fit to galaxy observations by Yasuda
et al. (AJ, 122 (2001) 1104) if the same K-corrections are added. It is shown
that observations of $N(z)$ for different magnitudes $m$ are a lot more
informative than the ones of $N(m).$",2006-06-09T15:13:55Z
"GRB 050717: A Long, Short-Lag, High Peak Energy Burst Observed by Swift
  and Konus","The long burst GRB 050717 was observed simultaneously by the Burst Alert
Telescope (BAT) on Swift and the Konus instrument on Wind. Significant hard to
soft spectral evolution was seen. Early gamma-ray and X-ray emission was
detected by both BAT and the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) on Swift. The XRT continued
to observe the burst for 7.1 days and detect it for 1.4 days. The X-ray light
curve showed a classic decay pattern; the afterglow was too faint for a jet
break to be detected. No optical, infrared or ultraviolet counterpart was
discovered despite deep searches within 14 hours of the burst. Two particular
features of the prompt emission make GRB 050717 a very unusual burst. First,
the peak of the nu Fnu spectrum was observed to be 2401(-568/+781) keV for the
main peak, which is the highest value of Epeak ever observed. Secondly, the
spectral lag for GRB 050717 was determined to be 2.5 +- 2.6 ms, consistent with
zero and unusually short for a long burst. This lag measurement suggests that
this burst has a high intrinsic luminosity and hence is at high redshift (z >
2.7). Despite these unusual features GRB 050717 exhibits the classic prompt and
afterglow behaviour of a gamma-ray burst.",2006-05-19T18:15:38Z
"On the self-enrichment scenario of galactic globular clusters:
  Constraints on the IMF","Galactic globular cluster (GC) stars exhibit abundance patterns which are not
shared by their field counterparts, In the framework of the widely accepted
""self-enrichment"" scenario for GCs, we present a new method to derive the
Initial Mass Function (IMF) of the polluter stars, by using the observed O/Na
abundance distribution. We focus on NGC 2808, a GC for which the largest sample
of O and Na abundance determinations is presently available. We consider two
classes of possible ""culprits"" : massive Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars
(4-9 Msun) and winds of massive stars (WMS) in the mass range 10-100 Msun. We
obtain upper limits for the slope of the IMF (assumed to be given by a
power-law) of the stars initially more massive than the present turnoff mass.
We also derive lower limits for the amount of stellar residues. We find that
the polluter IMF had to be much flatter than presently observed IMFs in stellar
clusters, in agreement with the results of two other methods for GC IMF
determination. Additionaly, we find that the present mass of the GC should be
totally dominated by stellar remnants if the polluters were AGB stars, but not
so in the case of WMS. We critically analyse the advantages and shortcomings of
each potential polluter class, and we find the WMS scenario more attractive.",2006-06-06T11:44:31Z
"Weak Lensing by Galaxies in Groups and Clusters: I.--Theoretical
  Expectations","Galaxy-galaxy lensing is rapidly becoming one of the most promising means to
accurately measure the average relation between galaxy properties and halo
mass. In order to obtain a signal of sufficient signal-to-noise, one needs to
stack many lens galaxies according to their property of interest, such as
luminosity or stellar mass. Since such a stack consists of both central and
satellite galaxies, which contribute very different lensing signals, the
resulting shear measurements can be difficult to interpret. In the past,
galaxy-galaxy lensing studies have either completely ignored this problem, have
applied rough isolation criteria in an attempt to preferentially select
`central' galaxies, or have tried to model the contribution of satellites
explicitely. However, if one is able to {\it a priori} split the galaxy
population in central and satellite galaxies, one can measure their lensing
signals separately. This not only allows a much cleaner measurement of the
relation between halo mass and their galaxy populations, but also allows a
direct measurement of the sub-halo masses around satellite galaxies. In this
paper, we use a realistic mock galaxy redshift survey to show that galaxy
groups, properly selected from large galaxy surveys, can be used to accurately
split the galaxy population in centrals and satellites. Stacking the resulting
centrals according to their group mass, estimated from the total group
luminosity, allows a remarkably accurate recovery of the masses and density
profiles of their host haloes. In addition, stacking the corresponding
satellite galaxies according to their projected distance from the group center
yields a lensing signal that can be used to accurate measure the masses of both
sub-haloes and host haloes. (Abridged)",2006-07-25T01:31:23Z
"Double-Layer Silicon PIN Photodiode X-Ray Detector for a Future X-ray
  Timing Mission","A double-layer silicon detector consisting of two 500micron-thick silicon PIN
photodiodes with independent readouts was mounted in a vacuum chamber and
tested with X-ray sources. The detector is sensitive from 1-30 keV with an
effective area of 6 mm^2. The detector performs best at -35 C with an energy

"High-Resolution Absorption Spectroscopy of Multi-phase, High-Metallicity
  Gas Associated with the Luminous Quasar HE 0226-4110","We present FUSE and HST/STIS observations of the absorption line system near
the emission redshift of the radio-quiet, X-ray bright quasar HE0226-4110 (z =
0.495, V=15.2). The spectra cover the rest-frame wavelength range 610--1150 A,
and we detect a wide range of ionization species, including four adjacent
stages of oxygen (O III-VI), which reveal a striking change in gas kinematics
with ionization. Examination of the O VI 1031, 1037 doublet profiles reveals no
evidence for partial coverage or unresolved saturated structure. O III is only
detected in a narrow feature which is also traced by H I and C III, suggesting
that they arise in the same gas. Absorption at the same velocity is also
present in other species N IV, O IV-VI, S IV, and possibly N VIII, but the
kinematics differ from the O III, implying production in separate gaseous
phases. The H I, O II-IV, and C III information in yield an estimate of both
the photoionization parameter and metallicity of the O III-bearing gas:
[O/H]=+0.12(-0.03/+0.16), log U=-2.29(-0.23/+0.02). We discuss two possible
locations for the gas in this associated absorption-line system: the narrow
emission line region of the quasar, and the halo of the quasar host galaxy. An
additional narrow (thus, photoionized) component that is only detected in O VI
appears 58 km/s redward of the O III-bearing gas with -0.35 < log U < 0.02.
Additional structure is detected in the associated absorber in the form of two
broad components which only appear in moderate to high ionization species.

Faint flux performance of an EMCCD,"Thorough numerical simulations were run to test the performance of three
processing methods of the data coming out from an electron multiplying charge

operated at high gain, under real operating conditions. The effect of read-out
noise and spurious charges is tested under various low flux conditions (0.001
event/pixel/frame < f < 20 events/pixel/frame). Moreover, a method for finding
the value of the gain applied by the EMCCD amplification register is also

"Isolated neutron stars: Magnetic fields, distances, and spectra","We present timing measurements, astrometry, and high-resolution spectra of a
number of nearby, thermally emitting, isolated neutron stars. We use these to
infer magnetic field strengths and distances, but also encounter a number of
puzzles. We discuss three specific ones in detail: (i) For RX J0720.4-3125 and
RX J1308.6+2127, the characteristic ages are in excess of 1~Myr, while their
temperatures and kinematic ages indicate that they are much younger; (ii) For
RX J1856.5-3754, the brightness temperature for the optical emission is in
excess of that measured at X-ray wavelengths for reasonable neutron-star radii;
(iii) For RX J0720.4-3125, the spectrum changed from an initially featureless
state to one with an absorption feature, yet there was only a relatively small
change in effective temperature. Furthermore, we attempt to see whether the
spectra of all seven sourced, in six of which absorption features have now been
found, can be understood in the context of strongly magnetised hydrogen
atmospheres. We find that the energies of the absorption features can be
reproduced, but that the featureless spectra of some sources, especially the
Wien-like high-energy tails, remain puzzling.",2006-07-14T02:37:23Z
"The Millennium Galaxy Catalogue: Bulge/Disc Decomposition of 10095
  Nearby Galaxies","We have modelled the light distribution in 10095 galaxies from the Millennium
Galaxy Catalogue (MGC), providing publically available structural catalogues
for a large, representative sample of galaxies in the local Universe. Three
different models were used: (1) a single Sersic function for the whole galaxy,
(2) a bulge-disc decomposition model using a de Vaucouleurs (R^{1/4}) bulge
plus exponential disc, (3) a bulge-disc decomposition model using a Sersic
(R^{1/n}) bulge plus exponential disc. Repeat observations for 700 galaxies
demonstrate that stable measurements can be obtained for object components with
a half-light radius comparable to, or larger than, the seeing half-width at
half maximum. We show that with careful quality control, robust measurements
can be obtained for large samples such as the MGC. We use the catalogues to
show that the galaxy colour bimodality is due to the two-component nature of
galaxies (i.e. bulges and discs) and not to two distinct galaxy populations. We
conclude that understanding galaxy evolution demands the routine bulge-disc
decomposition of the giant galaxy population at all redshifts.",2006-05-29T14:35:30Z
"The Masses of Nuclear Black Holes in Luminous Elliptical Galaxies and
  Implications for the Space Density of the Most Massive Black Holes","Black hole masses predicted from the Mbh-sigma relationship conflict with
those predicted from the Mbh-L relationship for the most luminous galaxies,
such as brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). This is because stellar velocity
dispersion, sigma, increases only weakly with L for BCGs and other giant
ellipticals. The Mbh-L relationship predicts that the most luminous BCGs may
have Mbh approaching 10^{10}M_sol, while the M-sigma relationship always
predicts Mbh<3X10^9M_sol. We argue that the Mbh-L relationship is a plausible
or even preferred description for BCGs and other galaxies of similar
luminosity. If cores in central stellar density are formed by binary BHs, then
the inner-core cusp radius, r_gamma, may be an independent witness of Mbh.
Using structural parameters derived from a large sample of early-type galaxies
observed by HST, we argue that L is superior to sigma as an indicator of
r_gamma in luminous galaxies. The observed r_gamma-Mbh relationship for 11 core
galaxies with measured Mbh appears to be consistent with the Mbh-L relationship
for BCGs. BCGs have large cores appropriate for their large luminosities that
may be difficult to generate with the modest BH masses inferred from the
Mbh-sigma relationship. Mbh~L may be expected to hold for BCGs, if they were
formed in dissipationless mergers, which should preserve ratio of BH to stellar
mass. This picture appears to be consistent with the slow increase in sigma
with L and the more rapid increase in effective radii with L seen in BCGs. If
BCGs have large BHs commensurate with their luminosities, then the local BH
mass function for Mbh>3X10^9M_sol may be nearly an order of magnitude richer
than that inferred from the Mbh-sigma relationship. The volume density of QSOs
at earlier epochs may favor the predictions from the Mbh-L relationship.",2006-06-29T20:11:43Z
"Constraining a double component dark energy model using type Ia

components has a polytropic form, while the other has a barotropic form. Exact
solutions are obtained and the cosmological parameters are constrained using
supernova type Ia data. In general, an open universe is predicted. A big rip
scenario is largely preferred, but the dispersion in the parameter space is
very high. Hence, even if scenarios without future singularities can not be
excluded with the allowed range of parameters, a phantom cosmology, with an
open spatial section, is a general prediction of the model. For a wide range of
the equation of state parameters there is an asymptotic de Sitter phase.",2006-06-07T20:03:58Z
"First direct detection of a Keplerian rotating disk around the Be star
  $α$ Arae using the VLTI/AMBER instrument","Aims. We aim to study the geometry and kinematics of the disk around the Be
star $\alpha$ Arae as a function of wavelength, especially across the
Br$\gamma$ emission line. The main purpose of this paper is to answer the
question about the nature of the disk rotation around Be stars. Methods. We use
the VLTI/AMBER instrument operating in the K band which provides a gain by a
factor 5 in spatial resolution compared to previous VLTI/MIDI observations.
Moreover, it is possible to combine the high angular resolution provided with
the (medium) spectral resolution of AMBER to study the kinematics of the inner
part of the disk and to infer its rotation law. Results. We obtain for the
first time the direct evidence that the disk is in keplerian rotation,
answering a question that occurs since the discovery of the first Be star
$\gamma$ Cas by father Secchi in 1866. We also present the global geometry of
the disk showing that it is compatible with a thin disk + polar enhanced winds
modeled with the SIMECA code. We found that the disk around $\alpha$ Arae is
compatible with a dense equatorial matter confined in the central region
whereas a polar wind is contributing along the rotational axis of the central
star. Between these two regions the density must be low enough to reproduce the
large visibility modulus (small extension) obtained for two of the four VLTI
baselines. Moreover, we obtain that $\alpha$ Arae is rotating very close to its
critical rotation. This scenario is also compatible with the previous MIDI
measurements.",2006-06-16T12:52:53Z
"Incorporating the molecular gas phase in galaxy-size numerical
  simulations: first applications in dwarf galaxies","We present models of the evolution of the gaseous and stellar content of
galaxies incorporating the formation of H_2 out of HI gas as part of such a
model. We do so by formulating a subgrid model for gas clouds that uses
well-known cloud scaling relations and solves for the HI-H_2 balance set by the
H_2 formation on dust grains and its FUV-induced photodissociation by the
temporally and spatially varying interstellar radiation field. This allows the
seamless tracking of the evolution of the H_2 gas phase, its precursor Cold
Neutral Medium (CNM) HI gas, simultaneously with the star formation. Our most
important findings are: a) a significant dependence of the HI-H_2 transition
and the resultant H_2 gas mass on the ambient metallicity and the H_2 formation
rate, b) the important influence of the characteristic star formation timescale
(regulating the ambient FUV radiation field) on the equilibrium H_2 gas mass
and c) the possibility of a diffuse H_2 gas phase. Finally, we implement and
briefly explore a novel approach of using the ambient H_2 gas mass fraction as
a criterion for the onset of star formation. (abridged)",2006-03-21T17:25:08Z
How accurate are the time delay estimates in gravitational lensing?,"We present a novel approach to estimate the time delay between light curves
of multiple images in a gravitationally lensed system, based on Kernel methods
in the context of machine learning. We perform various experiments with
artificially generated irregularly-sampled data sets to study the effect of the
various levels of noise and the presence of gaps of various size in the
monitoring data. We compare the performance of our method with various other
popular methods of estimating the time delay and conclude, from experiments
with artificial data, that our method is least vulnerable to missing data and
irregular sampling, within reasonable bounds of Gaussian noise. Thereafter, we
use our method to determine the time delays between the two images of quasar
Q0957+561 from radio monitoring data at 4 cm and 6 cm, and conclude that if
only the observations at epochs common to both wavelengths are used, the time
delay gives consistent estimates, which can be combined to yield 408\pm 12
days. The full 6 cm dataset, which covers a longer monitoring period, yields a
value which is 10% larger, but this can be attributed to differences in
sampling and missing data.",2006-05-01T20:42:03Z
Cosmic Voids and Galaxy Bias in the Halo Occupation Framework,"(Abridged) We investigate the power of void statistics to constrain galaxy
bias and the amplitude of dark matter fluctuations. We use the halo occupation
distribution (HOD) framework to describe the relation between galaxies and dark
matter. After choosing HOD parameters that reproduce the mean space density
n_gal and projected correlation function w_p measured for galaxy samples with
M_r<-19 and M_r<-21 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we predict the
void probability function (VPF) and underdensity probability function (UPF) of
these samples by populating the halos of a large, high-resolution N-body
simulation. If we make the conventional assumption that the HOD is independent
of large scale environment at fixed halo mass, then models constrained to match
n_gal and w_p predict nearly identical void statistics, independent of the
scatter between halo mass and central galaxy luminosity or uncertainties in HOD
parameters. Models with sigma_8=0.7 and sigma_8=0.9 also predict very similar
void statistics. However, the VPF and UPF are sensitive to environmental
variations of the HOD in a regime where these variations have little impact on
w_p. For example, doubling the minimum host halo mass in regions with large
scale (5 Mpc/h) density contrast delta<-0.65 has a readily detectable impact on
void probabilities of M_r<-19 galaxies, and a similar change for delta<-0.2
alters the void probabilities of M_r<-21 galaxies at a detectable level. The
VPF and UPF provide complementary information about the onset and magnitude of
density- dependence in the HOD. By detecting or ruling out HOD changes in low
density regions, void statistics can reduce systematic uncertainties in the
cosmological constraints derived from HOD modeling, and, more importantly,
reveal connections between halo formation history and galaxy properties.",2006-03-06T21:32:06Z
"High-frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillations from GRS 1915+105 in its C
  state","We report the results of a systematic timing analysis of RXTE observations of
GRS 1915+105 when the source was in its variability class theta, characterized
by alternating soft and hard states on a time scale of a few hundred seconds.
The aim was to examine the high-frequency part of the power spectrum in order
to confirm the hecto-Hertz Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPO) previously
reported from observations from mixed variability behaviours. During the hard
intervals (corresponding to state C in the classification of Belloni et al.,
2000, A&A, 35, 271), we find a significant QPO at a frequency of ~170 Hz,
although much broader (Q~2) than previously reported. No other significant peak
is observed at frequencies >30 Hz. A time-resolved spectral analysis of
selected observations shows that the hard intervals from class theta show a
stronger and steeper (Gamma=2.8-3.0) power-law component than hard intervals
from other classes. We discuss these results in the framework of hecto-Hertz
QPOs reported from GRS 1915+105 and other black-hole binaries.",2006-03-08T22:11:10Z
"Do most planetary nebulae derive from binaries? I Population synthesis
  model of the galactic planetary nebula population produced by singlestars and
  binaries","We present a population synthesis calculation to derive the total number of
planetary nebulae (PN) in the Galaxy that descend from single stars and stars
in binary systems. Using the most recent literature results on galactic and
stellar formation as well as stellar evolution, we predict the total number of
galactic PNe with radii <0.9 pc to be (46,000 +/- 13,000). We do not claim this
to be the complete population, since there can be visible PNe with radii larger
than this limit. However, by taking this limit, we make our predicted
population inherently comparable to the observationally-based value of
Peimbert, who determined (7200 +/- 1800) PNe should reside in the Galaxy today.
Our prediction is discrepant with the observations at the 2.9-sigma level, a
disagreement which we argue is meaningful in view of our specific treatment of
the uncertainty. We conclude that it is likely that only a subset of the stars
thought to be capable of making a visible PN, actually do. In the second paper
in this series, an argument will be presented that the bulk of the galactic PN
population might be better explained if only binaries produce PNe.
  The predicted PN formation rate density from single stars and binaries is
(1.1 +/- 0.5) x 10^{-12} PN/yr per cubic pc in the local neighborhood. This
number is lower than the most recent PN birthrate density estimates of 2.1 x
10^{-12} PN/yr per cubic pc, which are based on local PN counts and the PN
distance scale, but more in line with the white dwarf birthrate densities
determined by Liebert et al. ((1.0 +/- 0.25) x 10^{-12} WD/yr per cubic pc).
The predicted PN birthrate density will be revised down, if we assume that only
binaries make PNe. This revision will imply that the PN distance scale has to
be revised to larger values.",2006-06-14T18:37:09Z
"The impact of meridional circulation on stellar butterfly diagrams and
  polar caps","Observations of rapidly rotating solar-like stars show a significant mixture
of opposite-polarity magnetic fields within their polar regions. To explain
these observations, models describing the surface transport of magnetic flux
demand the presence of fast meridional flows. Here, we link sub-surface and
surface magnetic flux transport simulations to investigate (i) the impact of
meridional circulations with peak velocities of <125m/s on the latitudinal
eruption pattern of magnetic flux tubes and (ii) the influence of the resulting
butterfly diagrams on polar magnetic field properties. Prior to their eruption,
magnetic flux tubes with low field strengths and initial cross sections below
about 300km experience an enhanced poleward deflection through meridional
flows. In particular flux tubes which originate between low and intermediate
latitudes within the convective overshoot region are strongly affected. This
latitude-dependent poleward deflection of erupting magnetic flux renders the
wings of stellar butterfly diagrams distinctively convex. The subsequent
evolution of the surface magnetic field shows that the increased number of
newly emerging bipoles at higher latitudes promotes the intermingling of
opposite polarities of polar magnetic fields. The associated magnetic flux
densities are about 20% higher than in the case disregarding the pre-eruptive
deflection, which eases the necessity for fast meridional flows predicted by
previous investigations. In order to reproduce the observed polar field
properties, the rate of the meridional circulation has to be on the order of
100m/s, and the latitudinal range from which magnetic flux tubes originate at
the base of the convective zone (<50degrees) must be larger than in the solar
case (<35degrees).",2006-04-05T16:34:49Z
"The puzzling properties of the Helium White Dwarf orbiting the
  millisecond pulsar PSR J1911-5958A in NGC 6752","We have used phase-resolved high-resolution images and low resolution spectra
taken at the ESO Very Large Telescope, to study the properties of the low-mass
Helium White Dwarf companion to the millisecond pulsar \psr (hereafter COM
J1911$-$5958A), in the halo of the Galactic Globular Cluster NGC 6752. The
radial velocity curve confirms that \com is orbiting the pulsar and allows to
derive a systemic velocity of the binary system nicely in agreement with that
of NGC 6752. This strongly indicates that the system is a member of the
cluster, despite its very offset position ($\sim 74$ core radii) with respect
to the core. Constraints on the orbital inclination ($\gapp 70^\circ$) and
pulsar mass ($1.2-1.5 {\rm M_\odot}$) are derived from the mass ratio
$M_{PSR}/M_{COM}= 7.49\pm0.64$ and photometric properties of COM J1911$-$5958A.
The light curve in B-band shows two phases of unequal brightening
($\Delta$mag$\sim 0.3$ and 0.2, respectively) located close to quadratures and
superimposed on an almost steady baseline emission: this feature is quite
surprising and needs to be further investigated.",2006-03-10T14:30:26Z
Antisymmetric Metric Field as Dark Matter,"We consider the generation and evolution of quantum fluctuations of a massive
nonsymmetric gravitational field (B-field) from inflationary epoch to matter
era in the simplest variant of the nonsymmetric theory of gravitation (NGT),
which consists of a gauge kinetic term and a mass term.
  We observe that quite generically a nonsymmetric metric field with mass, m_B
~ 0.03(H_I/10^(13) GeV)^4 eV, is a good dark matter candidate, where H_I
denotes the inflationary scale. The most prominent feature of this dark matter
is a peak in power at a comoving momentum, k ~ sqrt(m_B H_0)/(1+z_eq)^(1/4),
where z_eq is the redshift at equality. This scale corresponds roughly to the
Earth-Sun distance.",2006-06-13T14:49:11Z
Stellar Properties of Embedded Protostars,"(Abridged) High dispersion spectrographs on large aperture telescopes have
recently allowed observers to study the stellar and accretion properties of
deeply embedded young stars, commonly referred to as Class I stars. We
summarize these newly determined properties and compare them with observations
of more optically revealed Class II (T Tauri) stars. Class I stars have
spectral types and stellar luminosities similar to those of Class II stars,
suggesting similar masses and ages. Estimates of stellar luminosity and age,
however, are especially uncertain given the large extinctions, scattered light
emission and continuum excesses typical of Class I stars. Several candidate
Class I brown dwarfs are identified. Class I stars appear to rotate more
rapidly than T Tauri stars, by roughly a factor of 2. Likewise, Class I disk
accretion rates are only a factor of two larger than those of T Tauri stars,
less than the mass infall rates predicted by envelope models by 1-2 orders of
magnitude. In at least a few cases the discrepancy appears to be caused by T
Tauri stars being misclassified as Class I stars because of their edge-on disk
orientation. Stars where the envelope density and infall velocity have been
determined directly and unambiguously imply that stellar mass is not acquired
in a steady-state fashion, but instead through brief outbursts of enhanced
accretion. If some Class I stars are in fact as old as T Tauri stars,
replenishment may be necessary to sustain the long-lived envelopes, possibly
via continued dynamical interactions with cloud material.",2006-04-04T20:33:38Z
"High-Performance Small-Scale Simulation of Star Clusters Evolution on
  Cray XD1","In this paper, we describe the performance of an $N$-body simulation of star
cluster with 64k stars on a Cray XD1 system with 400 dual-core Opteron
processors. A number of astrophysical $N$-body simulations were reported in
SCxy conferences. All previous entries for Gordon-Bell prizes used at least
700k particles. The reason for this preference of large numbers of particles is
the parallel efficiency. It is very difficult to achieve high performance on
large parallel machines, if the number of particles is small. However, for many
scientifically important problems the calculation cost scales as $O(N^{3.3})$,
and it is very important to use large machines for relatively small number of
particles. We achieved 2.03 Tflops, or 57.7% of the theoretical peak
performance, using a direct $O(N^2)$ calculation with the individual timestep
algorithm, on 64k particles. The best efficiency previously reported on similar
calculation with 64K or smaller number of particles is 12% (9 Gflops) on Cray
T3E-600 with 128 processors. Our implementation is based on highly scalable
two-dimensional parallelization scheme, and low-latency communication network
of Cray XD1 turned out to be essential to achieve this level of performance.",2006-06-06T15:13:19Z
Analysis methods for Atmospheric Cerenkov Telescopes,"Three different analysis techniques for Atmospheric Imaging System are
presented. The classical Hillas parameters based technique is shown to be
robust and efficient, but more elaborate techniques can improve the sensitivity

they use different information for gamma-hadron separation, and that it is
possible to combine their qualities.",2006-07-12T04:22:43Z
"The traveling wave MRI in cylindrical Taylor-Couette flow: comparing
  wavelengths and speeds in theory and experiment","We study experimentally the flow of a liquid metal confined between
differentially rotating cylinders, in the presence of externally imposed axial
and azimuthal magnetic fields. For increasingly large azimuthal fields a
wave-like disturbance arises, traveling along the axis of the cylinders. The
wavelengths and speeds of these structures, as well as the field strengths and
rotation rates at which they arise, are broadly consistent with theoretical
predictions of such a traveling wave magnetorotational instability.",2006-07-04T07:48:24Z
"The Thermal Regulation of Gravitational Instabilities in Protoplanetary
  Disks III. Simulations with Radiative Cooling and Realistic Opacities","This paper presents a fully three-dimensional radiative hydrodymanics
simulation with realistic opacities for a gravitationally unstable 0.07 Msun
disk around a 0.5 Msun star. We address the following aspects of disk
evolution: the strength of gravitational instabilities under realistic cooling,
mass transport in the disk that arises from GIs, comparisons between the
gravitational and Reynolds stresses measured in the disk and those expected in
an alpha-disk, and comparisons between the SED derived for the disk and SEDs
derived from observationally determined parameters. The mass transport in this
disk is dominated by global modes, and the cooling times are too long to permit
fragmentation for all radii. Moreover, our results suggest a plausible
explanation for the FU Ori outburst phenomenon.",2006-07-06T15:29:26Z
"Dynamical friction in constant density cores: a failure of the
  Chandrasekhar formula","Using analytic calculations and N-body simulations we show that in constant
density (harmonic) cores, sinking satellites undergo an initial phase of very
rapid (super-Chandrasekhar) dynamical friction, after which they experience no
dynamical friction at all. For density profiles with a central power law
profile of log-slope, $-\alpha$, the infalling satellite heats the background
and causes $\alpha$ to decrease. For $\alpha < 0.5$ initially, the satellite
generates a small central constant density core and stalls as in the $\alpha =
0$ case.
  We discuss some astrophysical applications of our results to decaying
satellite orbits, galactic bars and mergers of supermassive black hole
binaries. In a companion paper we show that a central constant density core can
provide a natural solution to the timing problem for Fornax's globular
clusters.",2006-06-26T20:20:29Z
"The N/O Plateau of Blue Compact Galaxies: Monte Carlo Simulations of the
  Observed Scatter","Chemical evolution models and Monte Carlo simulation techniques have been
combined for the first time to study the distribution of blue compact galaxies
on the N/O plateau. Each simulation comprises 70 individual chemical evolution
models. For each model, input parameters relating to a galaxy's star formation
history (bursting or continuous star formation, star formation efficiency),
galaxy age, and outflow rate are chosen randomly from ranges predetermined to
be relevant. Predicted abundance ratios from each simulation are collectively
overplotted onto the data to test its viability. We present our results both
with and without observational scatter applied to the model points. Our study
shows that most trial combinations of input parameters, including a simulation
comprising only simple models with instantaneous recycling, are successful in
reproducing the observed morphology of the N/O plateau once observational
scatter is added. Therefore simulations which include delay of nitrogen
injection are no longer favored over those which propose that most nitrogen is
produced by massive stars, if only the plateau morphology is used as the
principal constraint. The one scenario which clearly cannot explain plateau
morphology is one in which galaxy ages are allowed to range below 250 Myr. We
conclude that the present data for the N/O plateau are insufficient by
themselves for identifying the portion of the stellar mass spectrum most
responsible for cosmic nitrogen production.",2006-05-10T17:13:00Z
"Near-Infrared and Star-forming properties of Local Luminous Infrared
  Galaxies","We use HST NICMOS continuum and Pa-alpha observations to study the
near-infrared and star-formation properties of a representative sample of 30
local (d ~ 35-75Mpc) luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs, infrared 8-1000um
luminosities of L_IR=11-11.9[Lsun]). The data provide spatial resolutions of
25-50pc and cover the central ~3.3-7.1kpc regions of these galaxies. About half
of the LIRGs show compact (~1-2kpc) Pa-alpha emission with a high surface
brightness in the form of nuclear emission, rings, and mini-spirals. The rest
of the sample show Pa-alpha emission along the disk and the spiral arms
extending over scales of 3-7kpc and larger. About half of the sample contains
HII regions with H-alpha luminosities significantly higher than those observed
in normal galaxies. There is a linear empirical relationship between the mid-IR
24um and hydrogen recombination (extinction-corrected Pa-alpha) luminosity for
these LIRGs, and the HII regions in the central part of M51. This relation
holds over more than four decades in luminosity suggesting that the mid-IR
emission is a good tracer of the star formation rate (SFR). Analogous to the
widely used relation between the SFR and total IR luminosity of Kennicutt
(1998), we derive an empirical calibration of the SFR in terms of the
monochromatic 24um luminosity that can be used for luminous, dusty galaxies.",2006-06-08T09:26:33Z
"Deep Impact Mission to Tempel 1 Favours New Explosive Cosmogony of
  Comets","The assumption that short-period (SP) comets are fragments of massive icy
envelopes of Ganymede-like bodies saturated by products of ice electrolysis
that underwent global explosions provides a plausible explanation of all known
manifestations of comets, including the jet character of outflows, the presence
of ions in the vicinity of the nucleus, the bursts and splitting of cometary
nuclei, etc., with solar radiation initiating burning of the products of
electrolysis in the nucleus. As shown persuasively by numerical simulation
carried out in hydrodynamic approximation, the shock wave initiated by the Deep
Impact (DI) impactor in the cometary ice saturated originally by the
electrolysis products 2H2 + O2 is capable of activating under certain
conditions exothermal reactions (of the type O2 + H2 + organics = H2O + CO +
HCN + other products of incomplete burning of organics including its light and
heavy pyrolyzed compounds, soot, etc.), which will slow down shock wave damping
(forced detonation) and increase many times the energy release. As a result,
the measured energetics of ejections and outflows from the crater have to
exceed the DI energetics. Analysis of different clusters of the DI experiment
data confirms these conclusions and expectations and thus it favours the
planetary origin of comets.",2006-05-16T14:20:11Z
"Clustering of K-selected Galaxies at 2<z<3.5: Evidence for a
  Color-Density Relation","We study the clustering properties of K-selected galaxies at 2<z<3.5 using
deep multiwavelength imaging in three fields from the MUSYC survey. These are
the first measurements to probe the spatial correlation function of K-selected
galaxies in this redshift range on large scales, allowing for robust
conclusions about the dark matter halos that host these galaxies. K-selected
galaxies with K<21 have a correlation length r_0 ~ 6 h^-1 Mpc, larger than
typical values found for optically-selected galaxies. The correlation length
does not depend on K-band magnitude, but it does increase strongly with color;
the J-K>2.3 distant red galaxies (DRGs) have r_0 ~ 11 h^-1 Mpc. Contrary to
findings for optically-selected galaxies, K-selected galaxies that are faint in
the R-band cluster more strongly than brighter galaxies. These results suggest
that a color-density relation was in place at z>2. Our results indicate that
K-bright blue galaxies and K-bright red galaxies are fundamentally different,
as they have different clustering properties. Using a simple model of one
galaxy per halo, we infer halo masses ~ 5 x 10^12 M_sun for K<21 galaxies and ~
2 x 10^13 M_sun for DRGs. A comparison of the observed space density of DRGs to
the density of their host halos suggests large halo occupation numbers;
however, this result is at odds with the lack of a strong small-scale excess in
the angular correlation function. We find that the z=0 descendants of the
galaxies considered here reside primarily in groups and clusters. [abridged]",2006-06-14T19:16:10Z
"Constraining Primordial Non-Gaussianities from the WMAP2 2-1 Cumulant
  Correlator Power Spectrum","We measure the 2-1 cumulant correlator power spectrum $C^{21}_l$, a
degenerate bispectrum, from the second data release of the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). Our high resolution measurements with SpICE span a
large configuration space ($\simeq 168\times999$) corresponding to the possible
cross-correlations of the maps recorded by the different differencing
assemblies. We present a novel method to recover the eigenmodes of the
correspondingly large Monte Carlo covariance matrix. We examine its eigenvalue
spectrum and use random matrix theory to show that the off diagonal terms are
dominated by noise. We minimize the $\chi^2$ to obtain constraints for the
non-linear coupling parameter $f_{NL} = 22 \pm 52 (1\sigma)$.",2006-06-16T01:58:34Z
"Evolutionary Implications from SDSSJ085338.27+033246.1: A Spectacular N
  arrow-Line Seyfert 1 Galaxy with Young Post-starburst","We analyze the physical properties of post-starburst AGN SDSS
J085338.27+033246.1 according to its optical spectrum and discuss its
implications on AGN's evolution. The spectra PCA method is developed to extract
emission lines and absorption features from the total light spectrum. The
emission-line analysis indicates that the object can be classified as a NLS1
with FeII/H$\beta_{\rm{B}}=2.4\pm0.2$, large Eddington ratio ($\sim0.34$),
small black hole mass ($\sim1.1\times10^{7}M_{\odot}$) and intermediately
strong radio emission. A simple SSP model indicates that the absorption
features are reproduced by a $\sim$100 Myr old starburst with a mass of
$\sim7\times10^{9}M_{\odot}$ rather well. The current SFR
$\sim3.0M_{\odot}\rm{yr^{-1}}$ inferred from the [OII] emission is much smaller
than the past average SFR$\sim70M_{\odot}\rm{yr^{-1}}$, however. The line ratio
diagnosis using the BPT diagrams indicates that the narrow emission lines are
almost entirely emitted from HII regions. We further discuss a possible
evolutionary path that links AGN and starburst phenomena.",2006-05-16T03:02:50Z
FUSE Spectroscopy of the White Dwarf in U Geminorum,"Observations of U Gem with FUSE confirm that the WD is heated by the outburst
and cools during quiescence. At the end of an outburst, the best uniform
temperature WD model fits to the data indicate a temperature of 41,000 - 47,000
K, while in mid-quiescence, the temperature is 28,000 - 31,000 K, depending on
the gravity assumed for the WD. Photospheric abundance patterns at the end of
the outburst and in mid-quiescence show evidence of CNO processing. Improved
fits to the spectra can be obtained assuming there is a hotter, heated portion
of the WD, presumably an accretion belt, with a temperature of 60,000 - 70,000
K occupying 14-32% of the surface immediately after outburst. However, other
relatively simple models for the second component fit the data just as well and
there is no obvious signature that supports the hypothesis that the second
component arises from a separate region of the WD surface. Hence, other
physical explanations still must be considered to explain the time evolution of
the spectrum of U Gem in quiescence. Strong orbital phase dependent absorption,
most likely due to gas above the disk, was observed during the mid-quiescence
spectrum. This material, which can be modeled in terms of gas with a
temperature of 10,000-11,000 K and a density of 10**13 cm**-3, has a column
density of ~2 10**21 cm**-2 at orbital phase 0.6-0.85, and is probably the same
material that has been observed to cause dips in the lightcurve at X-ray
wavelengths in the past. The discrepancy described by Naylor et al. (2005)
between the radius of the WD derived on the one hand by the UV spectral
analysis and the distance to U Gem, and on the other, by the orbital elements
and the gravitational redshift remains a serious problem.",2006-05-10T17:14:18Z
"Accurate Astrometry and Photometry of Saturated and Coronagraphic Point
  Spread Functions","Accurate astrometry and photometry of saturated and coronagraphic point
spread functions (PSFs) are fundamental to both ground- and space-based high
contrast imaging projects. For ground-based adaptive optics imaging,
differential atmospheric refraction and flexure introduce a small drift of the
PSF with time, and seeing and sky transmission variations modify the PSF flux
distribution. For space-based imaging, vibrations, thermal fluctuations and
pointing jitters can modify the PSF core position and flux. These effects need
to be corrected to properly combine the images and obtain optimal
signal-to-noise ratios, accurate relative astrometry and photometry of detected
objects as well as precise detection limits. Usually, one can easily correct
for these effects by using the PSF core, but this is impossible when high
dynamic range observing techniques are used, like coronagrahy with a
non-transmissive occulting mask, or if the stellar PSF core is saturated. We
present a new technique that can solve these issues by using off-axis satellite
PSFs produced by a periodic amplitude or phase mask conjugated to a pupil
plane. It will be shown that these satellite PSFs track precisely the PSF
position, its Strehl ratio and its intensity and can thus be used to register
and to flux normalize the PSF. A laboratory experiment is also presented to
validate the theory. This approach can be easily implemented in existing
adaptive optics instruments and should be considered for future extreme
adaptive optics coronagraph instruments and in high-contrast imaging space
observatories.",2006-04-11T21:53:13Z
"Spiral stellar density waves and the flattening of abundance gradients
  in the warm gas component of spiral galaxies","Motivated by recent observations of plateaus and minima in the radial
abundance distributions of heavy elements in the Milky Way and some other
spiral galaxies, we propose a dynamical mechanism for the formation of such
features around corotation. Our numerical simulations show that the
non-axisymmetric gravitational field of spiral density waves generates cyclone
and anticylone gas flows in the vicinity of corotation. The anticyclones
flatten the pre-existing negative abundance gradients by exporting many more
atoms of heavy elements outside corotation than importing inside it. This
process is very efficient and forms plateaus of several kiloparsec in size
around corotation after two revolution periods of a galaxy. The strength of
anticyclones and, consequently, the sizes of plateaus depend on the pitch angle
of spiral arms and are expected to increase along the Hubble sequence.",2006-05-31T23:05:09Z
"RApid Temporal Survey - RATS II: Followup observations of 4 newly
  discovered short period variables","The RApid Temporal Survey (RATS) is a survey to detect objects whose optical
intensity varies on timescales of less than ~70 min. In our pilot dataset taken
with the INT and the Wide Field Camera in Nov 2003 we discovered nearly 50 new
variable objects. Many of these varied on timescales much longer than 1 hr.
However, only 4 objects showed a modulation on a timescale of 1 hour or less.
This paper presents followup optical photometry and spectroscopy of these 4
objects. We find that RAT J0455+1305 is a pulsating (on a period of 374 sec)
subdwarf B (sdB) star of the EC 14026 type. We have modelled its spectrum and
determine Teff = 29,200+/- 1900K and log g = 5.2+/-0.3 which locates it on the
cool edge of the EC 14026 instability strip. It has a modulation amplitude
which is one of the highest of any known EC 14026 star. Based on their spectra,
photometric variability and their infra-red colours, we find that RAT
J0449+1756, RAT J0455+1254 and RAT J0807+1510 are likely to be SX Phe stars -
dwarf Delta Sct stars. Our results show that our observing strategy is a good
method for finding rare pulsating stars.",2006-06-26T15:50:40Z
Meteorologic parameters analysis above Dome C made with ECMWF data,"In this paper we present the characterization of all the principal
meteorological parameters (wind speed and direction, pressure, absolute and
potential temperature) extended over 25 km from the ground and over two years
(2003 and 2004) above the Antarctic site of Dome C. The data set is composed by
'analyses' provided by the General Circulation Model (GCM) of the European
Center for Medium Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and they are part of the catalog
MARS. A monthly and seasonal (summer and winter time) statistical analysis of
the results is presented. The Richardson number is calculated for each month of
the year over 25 km to study the stability/instability of the atmosphere. This
permits us to trace a map indicating where and when the optical turbulence has
the highest probability to be triggered on the whole troposphere, tropopause
and stratosphere. We finally try to predict the best expected isoplanatic angle
and wavefront coherence time employing the Richardson number maps, the wind
speed profiles and simple analytical models of CN2 vertical profiles.",2006-06-21T14:25:16Z
"Submillimeter corrections to gravity and the metastability of white
  dwarf and neutron stars","The string inspired higher dimensional theories suggest modification of
Newton's law at submillimeter length scales. Inter-particle distances in white
dwarf and neutron stars are $10^{-10} cms$ and $10^{-13} cms$ respectively, and
therefore, the effects of of short distance corrections to gravity deserve
investigation. We show, by carrying out explicit analytical many-body
calculations that, in the presence of corrections, the normal state of these
compact stars become metastable. The actual quantum mechanical ground state of
the stars turns out to be unstable. However, the tunneling probability to the
unstable ground state is so small that the stars may remain trapped in the
metastable state practically for ever.",2006-03-20T11:20:29Z
Sulfur Volcanism on Io,"In February 2003, March 2003 and January 2004 Pele plume transmission spectra
were obtained during Jupiter transit with Hubble's Space Telescope Imaging
Spectrograph (STIS), using the 0.1 arcsec long slit and the G230LB grating. The
STIS spectra covered the 2100-3100 A wavelength region and extended spatially
along Io's limb both northward of Pele. The S2 and SO2 absorption signatures
evident in the these data indicate that the gas signature at Pele was
temporally variable, and that an S2 absorption signature was present ~ 12 deg.
from the Pele vent near 6+/-5 S and 264 +/-15 W, suggesting the presence of
another S2 bearing plume on Io. Contemporaneous with the spectral data, UV and
visible-wavelength images of the plume were obtained in reflected sunlight with
the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) prior to Jupiter transit. The dust
scattering recorded in these data provide an additional qualitative measure of
plume activity on Io, indicating that the degree of dust scattering over Pele
varied as a function of the date of observation, and that there were several
other dust bearing plumes active just prior to Jupiter transit. We present
constraints on the composition and variability of the gas abundances of the
Pele plume as well as the plumes detected by ACS and recorded within the STIS
data, as a function of time. We discuss the implications of these results for
thermochemical conditions at the plume vents, and our understanding of plume
eruption styles active on Io.",2006-03-13T22:04:36Z
Large-scale study of the NGC 1399 globular cluster system in Fornax,"We present a Washington C and Kron-Cousins R photometric study of the
globular cluster system of NGC 1399, the central galaxy of the Fornax cluster.
A large areal coverage of 1 square degree around NGC 1399 is achieved with
three adjoining fields of the MOSAIC II Imager at the CTIO 4-m telescope.
Working on such a large field, we can perform the first indicative
determination of the total size of the NGC 1399 globular cluster system. The
estimated angular extent, measured from the NGC 1399 centre and up to a
limiting radius where the areal density of blue globular clusters falls to 30
per cent of the background level, is 45 +/- 5 arcmin, which corresponds to 220
- 275 kpc at the Fornax distance. The bimodal colour distribution of this
globular cluster system, as well as the different radial distribution of blue
and red clusters, up to these large distances from the parent galaxy, are
confirmed. The azimuthal globular cluster distribution exhibits asymmetries
that might be understood in terms of tidal stripping of globulars from NGC
1387, a nearby galaxy. The good agreement between the areal density profile of
blue clusters and a projected dark-matter NFW density profile is emphasized.",2006-03-14T14:35:13Z
A far-infrared molecular and atomic line survey of the Orion KL region,"We have carried out a high spectral resolution line survey towards the Orion
Kleinmann-Low (KL) cluster from 44-188 um. The observations were taken with the
Long Wavelength Spectrometer (LWS) in Fabry-Perot mode, on board the Infrared
Space Observatory (ISO). A total of 152 lines are clearly detected and a
further 34 features are present as possible detections. The spectrum is
dominated by the molecular species H2O, OH and CO, along with [OI] and [CII]
lines from PDR or shocked gas and [OIII], [NIII] lines from the foreground M42
HII region. Several isotopic species, as well as NH3, are also detected. HDO
and H3O+ are tentatively detected for the first time in the far-infrared range
towards Orion-KL. A basic analysis of the line observations is carried out, by
comparing with previous measurements and published models and deriving
rotational temperatures and column densities in the case of the molecular
species. The complexity of the region requires more sophisticated models for
the interpretation of all the line observations.",2006-05-17T14:12:21Z

"A comparison of hydrodynamics techniques for modelling collisions
  between main sequence stars","An Eulerian TVD code and a Lagrangian SPH code are used to simulate the
off-axis collision of equal-mass main sequence stars in order to address the
question of whether stellar mergers can produce a remnant star where the
interior has been replenished with hydrogen due to significant mixing. Each
parent main sequence star is chosen to be found near the turnoff, with hydrogen
depleted in the core, and is modelled with a M=0.8 solar mass realistic stellar
model and as a n=3 polytrope. An ideal fluid description with adiabatic index
gamma=5/3 is used for all hydrodynamic calculations. We found good agreement
between the simulations for the polytropic case, with the remnant showing
strong, non-local mixing throughout. In the interior quarter of the mass, ~35%
is mixed in from larger radii and on average the remnant is ~50% fully mixed.
For the realistic model, we found less mixing, particularly in the interior and
in the SPH simulation. In the inner quarter, ~20% of the contained mass in the
TVD case, but only ~3% in the SPH one is mixed in from outside. The simulations
give consistent results for the overall profile of the merger remnant and the
amount of mass loss, but the differences in mixing suggests that the intrinsic
difference between grid and particle based schemes remains a possible artifact.
We conclude that both the TVD and SPH schemes can be used equally well for
problems that are best suited to their strengths and that care should be taken
in interpreting results about fluid mixing.",2006-05-31T19:03:57Z
Neutrino detectors in ice: results and perspectives,"The AMANDA neutrino detector has been in operation at the South Pole for
several years. A number of searches for extraterrestrial sources of high energy
neutrinos have been performed. A selection of results is presented in this
paper. The much larger IceCube detector will extend the instrumented ice volume
to a cubic kilometer and 9 out of 80 planned IceCube strings have been deployed
to date. We present the status for both detectors.",2006-06-09T14:37:03Z
On the Lyman-alpha and Lyman-beta lines in solar coronal streamers,"We investigate the formation of the H I Lyman-alpha and Lyman-beta lines in
an equatorial coronal streamer. Particular attention is paid to frequency
redistribution for the scattering of the incident radiation. The properties of
the spectral lines are studied. The coronal model is given by a global 2.5-D
three fluid solar wind model with alpha particles. The emergent intensities and
line profiles are calculated from the solution of the statistical equilibrium
and radiative transfer equations for an hydrogen atom with 11 energy levels
under non local thermodynamic equilibrium. The formation of the lines results
from radiative excitation, collisional excitation, and takes into account the
coupling with all other transitions between the hydrogen energy levels. We
present new estimates of the radiative and collisional contributions of the
Lyman line intensities within the streamer. It is also shown that within the
streamer, the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the Lyman-beta line is a
better indicator of the plasma temperature than that of Lyman-alpha. These
results show that care should be taken when inferring the proton temperature
from the Lyman-alpha line profile as observed in coronal streamers, e.g. by the
Ultraviolet Coronagraph Spectrometer or the Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of
Emitted Radiation experiments on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory.",2006-06-05T21:20:18Z
Determination of the atmospheric neutrino fluxes from experimental data,"The precise knowledge of the atmospheric neutrino fluxes is a key ingredient
in the interpretation of the results from any atmospheric neutrino experiment.
In the standard atmospheric neutrino data analysis, these fluxes are
theoretical inputs obtained from sophisticated numerical calculations. In this
contribution we present an alternative approach to the determination of the
atmospheric neutrino fluxes based on the direct extraction from the
experimental data on neutrino event rates.",2006-08-04T11:47:10Z
X-ray Spectral Variations of U Gem from Quiescence to Outburst,"In this paper we report the discovery of a high energy component of the X-ray
spectra of U Gem, which can be observed while the source is in outburst. We
used Chandra and XMM-Newton observations to compare the quiescence and outburst
X-ray spectra of the source. The additional component may be the result of the
reflection of X-rays emitted from an optically thin plasma close to the white
dwarf, from the optically thick boundary layer during the outburst. Another
possible explanation is that some magnetically channeled accretion may occur
onto the equatorial belt of the primary causing shocks similar to the ones in
the intermediate polars as it was suggested by \citep{w2002}. We have also
found a timing structure at about 73 mHz ($\sim$13.7 s.) in the RXTE
observation, resembling dwarf novae oscillations (DNOs).",2006-08-03T15:47:31Z
"Adaptive Optics Correction of the Wavefront Distortions Induced by
  Segments Misalignment in Extremely Large Telescope","The capability of the adaptive optics to correct for the segmentation error
is analyzed in terms of the residual wavefront RMS and the power spectral
density of the phase. The analytical model and the end-to-end simulation give
qualitatively equal results justifying the significance of the geometrical
matching between segmentation geometry and the actuators/subaperture
distribution of the adaptive optics. We also show that the design of the
wavefront sensor is rather critical.",2006-06-16T11:59:50Z
"The Star-Forming Region NGC 346 in the Small Magellanic Cloud with
  Hubble Space Telescope ACS Observations I. Photometry","We present a photometric study of the star-forming region NGC 346 and its
surrounding field in the Small Magellanic Cloud, using data taken with the
Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).
The data set contains both short and long exposures for increased dynamic
range, and photometry was performed using the ACS module of the stellar
photometry package DOLPHOT. We detected almost 100,000 stars over a magnitude
range of V ~ 11 to V ~ 28 mag, including all stellar types from the most
massive young stars to faint lower main sequence and pre-main sequence stars.
We find that this region, which is characterized by a plethora of stellar
systems and interesting objects, is an outstanding example of mixed stellar
populations. We take into account different features of the color-magnitude
diagram of all the detected stars to distinguish the two dominant stellar
systems: The stellar association NGC 346 and the old spherical star cluster BS
90. These observations provide a complete stellar sample of a field about 5
arcmin x 5 arcmin around the most active star-forming region in this galaxy.
Considering the importance of these data for various investigations in the
area, we provide the full stellar catalog from our photometry. This paper is
the first part of an ongoing study to investigate in detail the two dominant
stellar systems in the area and their surrounding field.",2006-06-23T11:29:38Z
"The Cosmic Microwave Background and the Ionization History of the
  Universe","Details of how the primordial plasma recombined and how the universe later
reionized are currently somewhat uncertain. This uncertainty can restrict the
accuracy of cosmological parameter measurements from the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB). More positively, future CMB data can be used to constrain the
ionization history using observations. We first discuss how current
uncertainties in the recombination history impact parameter constraints, and
show how suitable parameterizations can be used to obtain unbiased parameter
estimates from future data. Some parameters can be constrained robustly,
however there is clear motivation to model recombination more accurately with
quantified errors. We then discuss constraints on the ionization fraction
binned in redshift during reionization. Perfect CMB polarization data could in
principle distinguish different histories that have the same optical depth. We
discuss how well the Planck satellite may be able to constrain the ionization
history, and show the currently very weak constraints from WMAP three-year
data.",2006-06-22T15:47:37Z
The density profiles of hot galactic halo gas,"Extended gas haloes around galaxies are a ubiquitous prediction of galaxy
formation scenarios. However, the density profiles of this hot halo gas is
virtually unknown, although various profiles have been suggested on theoretical
grounds. In order to quantitatively address the gas profile, we compare
galaxies from direct cosmological simulations with analytical solutions of the
underlying gas equations. We find remarkable agreement between simulations and
theoretical predictions. We present an expression for this gas profile with a
non-trivial dependence on the total mass profile. This expression is useful
when setting up equilibrium galaxy models for numerical experiments.",2006-06-13T08:19:46Z
"From Radio to X-ray: The Quiescent Atmosphere of the dMe Flare Star EV
  Lacertae","We report on multi-wavelength observations spanning radio to X-ray
wavelengths of the M dwarf flare star, EV Lacertae, probing the characteristics
of the outer atmospheric plasma from the upper chromosphere to the corona. We
detect the star at a wavelength of 2 cm (15 GHz) for the first time. UV and FUV
line profiles show evidence of nonthermal broadening, and the velocity width
appear to peak at lower temperatures than in the Sun; this trend is confirmed
in another active M dwarf flare star. Electron density measurements indicate
nearly constant electron pressures between $\log T=$5.2 and 6.4. At higher
coronal temperatures, there is a sharp increase of two orders of magnitude in
density (n$_{e}\sim10^{13}$ cm$^{-3}$ at $\log T=$6.9). X-ray, EUV, FUV and NUV
spectra constrain the DEM from the upper chromosphere through the corona. The
coronal pressures are inconsistent with the assumption of hydrostatic
equilibrium, either through EM modeling or application of scaling laws, and
imply large conductive loss rates and a large energy input at the highest
temperatures. The timescales for radiative and conductive losses in EV Lac's
upper atmosphere imply that significant continued heating must occur for the
corona to maintain its quiescent properties. The high frequency radio detection
requires the high temperature X-ray-emitting coronal plasma to be spatially
distinct from the radio emission source. Length scales in the low-temperature
corona are markedly larger than those in the high-temperature corona, further
suggestions of an inhomogeneous mixture of thermal and nonthermal coronal
plasma.",2006-04-11T21:36:57Z
The first year of SN 2004dj in NGC 2403,"New BVRI photometry and optical spectroscopy of the Type IIp supernova 2004dj
in NGC 2403, obtained during the first year since discovery, are presented. The
progenitor cluster, Sandage 96, is also detected on pre-explosion frames. The
light curve indicates that the explosion occured about 30 days before
discovery, and the plateau phase lasted about +110 \pm 20 days after that. The
plateau-phase spectra have been modelled with the SYNOW spectral synthesis code
using H, NaI, TiII, ScII, FeII and BaII lines. The SN distance is inferred from
the Expanding Photosphere Method and the Standard Candle Method applicable for
SNe IIp. They resulted in distances that are consistent with each other as well
as earlier Cepheid- and Tully-Fisher distances. The average distance, D = 3.47
\pm 0.29 Mpc is proposed for SN 2004dj and NGC 2403. The nickel mass produced
by the explosion is estimated as 0.02 \pm 0.01 M_o. The SED of the progenitor
cluster is reanalysed by fitting population synthesis models to our observed
BVRI data supplemented by U and JKH magnitudes from the literature. The
chi^2-minimization revealed a possible ""young"" solution with cluster age T_{cl}
= 8 Myr, and an ""old"" solution with T_{cl} = 20 - 30 Myr. The ""young"" solution
would imply a progenitor mass M > 20 M_o, which is higher than the previously
detected progenitor masses for Type II SNe.",2006-04-11T07:02:35Z
The UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey Early Data Release,"This paper defines the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) Early Data
Release (EDR). UKIDSS is a set of five large near-infra-red surveys defined by
Lawrence et al. (2006), being undertaken with the UK Infra-red Telescope
(UKIRT) Wide Field Camera (WFCAM). The programme began in May 2005 and has an
expected duration of seven years. Each survey uses some or all of the broadband
filter complement ZYJHK. The EDR is the first public release of data to the
European Southern Observatory (ESO) community. All worldwide releases occur
after a delay of 18 months from the ESO release. The EDR provides a small
sample dataset, ~50 sq.deg (about 1% of the whole of UKIDSS), that is a lower
limit to the expected quality of future survey data releases. In addition, an
EDR+ dataset contains all EDR data plus extra data of similar quality, but for
areas not observed in all of the required filters (amounting to ~220 sq.deg).
The first large data release, DR1, will occur in mid-2006. We provide details
of the observational implementation, the data reduction, the astrometric and
photometric calibration, and the quality control procedures. We summarise the
data coverage and quality (seeing, ellipticity, photometricity, depth) for each
survey and give a brief guide to accessing the images and catalogues from the
WFCAM Science Archive.",2006-03-22T15:32:30Z
Can sterile neutrinos be ruled out as warm dark matter candidates?,"We present constraints on the mass of warm dark matter (WDM) particles from a
combined analysis of the matter power spectrum inferred from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey \lya flux power spectrum at 2.2<z<4.2, cosmic microwave background
data, and the galaxy power spectrum. We obtain a lower limit of m~10 keV (2
sigma) if the WDM consists of sterile neutrinos and m~2 keV (2 sigma) for early
decoupled thermal relics. If we combine this bound with the constraint derived
from x-ray flux observations in the Coma cluster, we find that the allowed
sterile neutrino mass is ~10 keV (in the standard production scenario). Adding
constraints based on x-ray fluxes from the Andromeda galaxy, we find that dark
matter particles cannot be sterile neutrinos, unless they are produced by a
nonstandard mechanism (resonant oscillations, coupling with the inflaton) or
get diluted by some large entropy release.",2006-05-30T09:03:21Z
Coupling light into optical fibres near the diffraction limit,"The burgeoning field of astrophotonics explores the interface between
astronomy and photonics. Important applications include photonic OH suppression
at near-infrared wavelengths, and integrated photonic spectroscopy. These new
photonic mechanisms are not well matched to conventional multi-mode fibres and
are best fed with single or few-mode fibres. We envisage the largest gains in
astrophotonics will come from instruments that operate with single or few-mode
fibres in the diffraction limited or near diffraction limited regimes. While
astronomical instruments have largely solved the problem of coupling light into
multi-mode fibres this is largely unexplored territory for few-mode and
single-mode fibres. Here we describe a project to explore this topic in detail,
and present initial results on coupling light into single and few-mode fibres
at the diffraction limit. We find that fibres with as few as ~5 guided modes
have qualitatively different behaviour to single-mode fibres and share a number
of the beneficial characteristics of multi-mode fibres.",2006-06-13T02:57:17Z
"CRPropa: A Numerical Tool for the Propagation of UHE Cosmic Rays,
  Gamma-rays and Neutrinos","To understand the origin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs, defined to
be above 10^18 eV), it is required to model in a realistic way their
propagation in the Universe. UHECRs can interact with low energy radio,
microwave, infrared and optical photons to produce electron/positron pairs or
pions. The latter decay and give rise to neutrinos and electromagnetic cascades
extending down to MeV energies. In addition, deflections in cosmic magnetic
fields can influence the spectrum and sky distribution of primary cosmic rays
and, due to the increased propagation path length, the secondary neutrino and
gamma-ray fluxes. Neutrino, gamma-ray, cosmic ray physics and extra-galactic
magnetic fields are, therefore, strongly linked subjects and should be
considered together in order to extract maximal information from existing and
future data, like the one expected from the Auger Observatory. For that
purpose, we have developed CRPropa, a publicly-available numerical package
which takes into account interactions and deflections of primary UHECRs as well
as propagation of secondary electromagnetic cascades and neutrinos. CRPropa
allows to compute the observable properties of UHECRs and their secondaries in
a variety of models for the sources and propagation of these particles. Here we
present physical processes taken into account as well as benchmark examples; a
detailed documentation of the code can be found on our web site.",2006-03-24T17:18:06Z
Photometric Variability of Be/X-ray-Pulsar Binaries in the SMC,"We have studied the photometric variability of ten SMC Be/X-ray pulsars using
MACHO and OGLE-II data. For some of these systems we have found periodic
behavior, including orbital outbursts and/or nonradial pulsations (NRP) of the
Be star. For others we were unable to identify any clear photometric
periodicity, although their longterm light curves show significant structure.
We present periodograms, phase dispersion minimization (PDM) variances, and
folded light curves for the systems which exhibit periodic photometric
variability.",2006-05-16T19:49:28Z
Instruments without optics: an integrated photonic spectrograph,"In recent years, a great deal of emphasis has been placed on achieving the
diffraction limit with large aperture telescopes. For a well matched
focal-plane instrument, the diffraction limit provides the highest possible
angular resolution and sensitivity per pixel. But it offers another key
advantage as we now show. Conventionally, as the telescope aperture D grows,
the instrument size grows in proportion to D, and cost increases as D^2 or
faster. However, an instrument that operates at the diffraction limit can break
the trend of spiralling costs. In traditional instruments, the light must pass
through a succession of large lenses, mirrors and gratings, making it difficult
to conserve the integrity of such as small psf. An alternative approach, as we
now show, is to couple the diffraction limited beam directly into an integrated
photonic spectrograph operating in low-order modes.",2006-06-13T02:04:10Z
"The K-band Spectrum of The Hot Star in IRS~8: An Outsider in the
  Galactic Center?","Using adaptive optics at the Gemini North telescope we have obtained a K-band
spectrum of the star near the center of the luminous Galactic center bowshock
IRS8, as well as a spectrum of the bowshock itself. The stellar spectrum
contains emission and absorption lines characteristic of an O5-O6 giant or
supergiant. The wind from such a star is fully capable of producing the
observed bowshock. However, both the early spectral type and the apparently
young age of the star, if it is single, mark it as unique among hot stars
within one parsec of the center.",2006-07-24T21:36:03Z
"Possibilities of analysis of brightness distributions for components of
  eclipsing variables from data of space photometry","We carried out numerical experiments on the evaluation of the possibilities
of obtaining the information about brightness distributions for the components
of eclipsing variables from the data of high-precision photometry expected for
planned satellites COROT and Kepler. We examined a simple model of the
eclipsing binary with the spherical components on circular orbits and the
linear law of the limb darkening. The solutions of light curves have been
obtained as by fitting of the nonlinear model, into the number of parameters of
which included the limb darkening coefficients, so also by the solution of the
ill-posed inverse problem of restoration of brightness distributions across the
disks of stars without rigid model constraints on the form of these functions.
The obtained estimations show that if the observational accuracy amounts to
0.0001 then the limb darkening coefficients can be found with the relative
error approximately 0.01 . The brightness distributions across the disks of
components can be restored also nearly with the same accuracy.",2006-07-12T09:08:22Z
"A Survey of Merger Remnants III: Are Merger Remnants Supported by
  Rotation or Anisotropy","A growing body of observational evidence suggests that the luminosity,
photometric shape and amount of rotational or anisotropical support in
elliptical galaxies may provide vital clues to how they formed. Elliptical
galaxies appear to fall into two distinct categories based on these parameters:
bright, boxy shaped, with little or no rotation, and less luminous, disky
shaped with significant rotation. One viable formation scenario is the ``Merger
hypothesis,'' in which two disk galaxies merge to form a new elliptical galaxy.
A comparison of the luminosity, photometric shape, and amount of rotation in
advanced merger remnants may shed more light on the possible formation
scenarios of elliptical galaxies. Yet, little observational data exists for
such merger remnants. This paper is the third in a series investigating the
photometric and kinematic properties of a sample of 51 optically selected
advanced merger remnants. Presented here are K-band isophotal shapes and
spatially resolved kinematics for a sub-sample of 37 merger remnants. The
results show that ~ 11% of the sample are boxy, and anisotropically supported
while ~ 47% are disky, and rotationally supported. The remainder of the sample
show variations among expected correlations between shape and rotation. This
may suggest that the isophotal shapes are still ``in flux.'' There does appear
to be a lower limit to the amount of anisotropy observed in the merger
remnants. This may provide an observational diagnostic for discriminating among
formation scenarios in elliptical galaxies.",2006-04-24T15:23:50Z
"Telescope Spectrophotometric and Absolute Flux Calibration, and National
  Security Applications, Using a Tunable Laser on a Satellite","We propose a tunable laser-based satellite-mounted spectrophotometric and
absolute flux calibration system, to be utilized by ground- and space-based
telescopes. As spectrophotometric calibration may play a significant role in
the accuracy of photometric redshift measurement, and photometric redshift
accuracy is important for measuring dark energy using SNIa, weak gravitational
lensing, and baryon oscillations, a method for reducing such uncertainties is
needed. We propose to improve spectrophotometric calibration, currently
obtained using standard stars, by placing a tunable laser and a wide-angle
light source on a satellite by early next decade (perhaps included in the
upgrade to the GPS satellite network) to improve absolute flux calibration and
relative spectrophotometric calibration across the visible and near-infrared
spectrum. As well as fundamental astrophysical applications, the system
proposed here potentially has broad utility for defense and national security
applications such as ground target illumination and space communication.",2006-04-16T04:36:56Z
The Clustering of Massive Halos,"The clustering properties of dark matter halos are a firm prediction of
modern theories of structure formation. We use two large volume,
high-resolution N-body simulations to study how the correlation function of
massive dark matter halos depends upon their mass and formation history. We
find that halos with the lowest concentrations are presently more clustered
than those of higher concentration, the size of the effect increasing with halo
mass; this agrees with trends found in studies of lower mass halos. The
clustering dependence on other characterizations of the full mass accretion
history appears weaker than the effect with concentration. Using the integrated
correlation function, marked correlation functions, and a power-law fit to the
correlation function, we find evidence that halos which have recently undergone
a major merger or a large mass gain have slightly enhanced clustering relative
to a randomly chosen population with the same mass distribution.",2006-06-28T21:50:39Z
"The Sub-parsec Scale Radio Properties of Southern Starburst Galaxies. I.
  Supernova Remnants, the Supernova Rate, and the Ionised Medium in the NGC 253
  Starburst","Wide-field, very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of the
nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253, obtained with the Australian Long Baseline
Array (LBA), have produced a 2.3 GHz image with a maximum angular resolution of
15 mas (0.3 pc). Six sources were detected, all corresponding to sources
identified in higher frequency (>5 GHz) VLA images. One of the sources,
supernova remnant 5.48-43.3, is resolved into a shell-like structure
approximately 90 mas (1.7 pc) in diameter. From these data and data from the
literature, the spectra of 20 compact radio sources in NGC 253 were modelled
and found to be consistent with free-free absorbed power laws. Broadly, the
free-free opacity is highest toward the nucleus but varies significantly
throughout the nuclear region (tau_0 ~ 1->20), implying that the overall
structure of the ionised medium is clumpy. Of the 20 sources, nine have flat
intrinsic spectra associated with thermal radio emission and the remaining 11
have steep intrinsic spectra, associated with synchrotron emission from
supernova remnants. A supernova rate upper limit of 2.4 yr^-1 is determined for
the inner 320 pc region of the galaxy at the 95% confidence level, based on the
lack of detection of new sources in observations spanning almost 17 years and a
simple model for the evolution of supernova remnants. A supernova rate of >0.14
(v/10^4) yr^-1 is implied from estimates of supernova remnant source counts,
sizes and expansion rates, where v is the radial expansion velocity of the
supernova remnant in km s^-1. A star formation rate of 3.4 (v/10^4) <
SFR(M<=5Msun) < 59 Msun yr^-1 has been estimated directly from the supernova
rate limits and is of the same order of magnitude as rates determined from
integrated FIR and radio luminosities.",2006-06-06T08:36:08Z
"Abundance analysis of 5 early-type stars in the young open cluster
  IC2391","It is unclear whether chemically peculiar stars of the upper main sequence
represent a class completely distinct from normal A-type stars, or whether
there exists a continuous transition from the normal to the most peculiar late
F- to early B-type stars. A systematic abundance analysis of open cluster
early-type stars would help to relate the observed differences of the chemical
abundances of the photospheres to other stellar characteristics, without being
concerned by possible different original chemical composition. Furthermore, if
a continuous transition region from the very peculiar to the so called normal
A-F stars exists, it should be possible to detect objects with mild
peculiarities. As a first step of a larger project, an abundance analysis of 5
F-A type stars in the young cluster IC2391 was performed using high resolution
spectra obtained with the UVES instrument of the ESO VLT. Our targets seem to
follow a general abundance pattern: close to solar abundance of the light
elements and iron peak elements, heavy elements are slightly overabundant with
respect to the sun, similar to what was found in previous studies of normal
field A-type stars of the galactic plane. We detected a weakly chemically
peculiar star, HD74044. Its element pattern contains characteristics of CP1 as
well as CP2 stars, enhanced abundances of iron peak elements and also higher
abundances of Sc, Y, Ba and Ce. We did not detect a magnetic field in this star
(detection limit was 2kG). We also studied the star SHJM2, proposed as a
pre-main sequence object in previous works. Using spectroscopy we found a high
surface gravity, which suggests that the star is very close to the ZAMS.",2006-04-05T15:38:54Z
Self-Gravity Driven Instabilities in the ISM,"In order to understand star formation it is important to understand the
dynamics of atomic and molecular clouds in the interstellar medium (ISM).
Nonlinear hydrodynamic flows are a key component to the ISM. One route by which
nonlinear flows arise is the onset and evolution of interfacial instabilities.
Interfacial instabilities act to modify the interface between gas components at
different densities and temperatures. Such an interface may be subject to a
host of instabilities, including the Rayleigh-Taylor, Kelvin-Helmholtz, and
Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities. Recently, a new density interface instability
was identified. This self-gravity interfacial instability (SGI) causes any
displacement of the interface to gr ow on roughly a free-fall time scale, even
when the perturbation wavelength is much less than the Jeans length. In
previous work, we used numerical simulations to confirm the expectations of
linear theory and examine the nonlinear evolution of the SGI. We now continue
our study by generalizing our initial conditions to allow the acceleration due
to self-gravity to be non-zero across the interface. We also consider the
behaviour of the SGI for perturbation wavelengths near the Jeans wavelength. We
conclude that the action of self-gravity across a density interface may play a
significant role in the ISM either by fueling the growth of new instabilities
or modifying the evolution of existing instabilities.",2006-03-29T23:26:22Z
"Effects of Rotation on Thermal-Gravitational Instability in the
  Protogalactic Disk Environment","Thermal-gravitational instability (TGI) is studied in the protogalactic
environment. We extend our previous work, where we found that dense clumps
first form out of hot background gas by thermal instability and later a small
fraction of them grow to virialized clouds of mass M_c >~ 6X10^6 M_sun by
gravitational infall and merging. But these clouds have large angular momentum,
so they would be difficult, if not impossible, to further evolve into globular
clusters. In this paper, through three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations in
a uniformly rotating frame, we explore if the Coriolis force due to rotation in
protogalactic disk regions can hinder binary merging and reduce angular
momentum of the clouds formed. With rotation comparable to the Galactic
rotation at the Solar circle, the Coriolis force is smaller than the pressure
force during the early thermal instability stage. So the properties of clumps
formed by thermal instability are not affected noticeably by rotation, except
increased angular momentum. However, during later stage the Coriolis force
becomes dominant over the gravity, and hence the further growth to
gravitationally bound clouds by gravitational infall and merging is prohibited.
Our results show that the Coriolis force effectively destroys the picture of
cloud formation via TGI, rather than alleviate the problem of large angular
momentum.",2006-04-26T06:17:16Z
"On the sensitivity of HeI singlet lines to the FeIV model atom in O
  stars","Recent calculations and analyses of O star spectra have revealed
discrepancies between theory and observations, and between different
theoretical calculations, for the strength of optical HeI singlet
transitions.We investigate the source of these discrepancies. Using a non-LTE
radiative transfer code we have undertaken detailed test calculations for a
range of O star properties. Our principal test model has parameters similar to
those of the O9V star, 10 Lac. We show that the discrepancies arise from
uncertainties in the radiation field in the HeI resonance transition near
584Angs. The radiation field at 584Angs. is influenced by model assumptions,
such as the treatment of line-blanketing and the adopted turbulent velocity,
and by the FeIV atomic data. It isshown that two FeIV transitions near 584Angs
can have a substantial influence on the strength of the HeI singlet
transitions. Because of the difficulty of modeling the HeI singlet lines,
particularly in stars with solar metalicity, the HeI triplet lines should be
preferred in spectral analyses. These lines are much less sensitive to model
assumptions.",2006-05-08T22:57:05Z
Unveiling the Boxy Bulge and Bar of the Andromeda Spiral Galaxy,"A new, 2.8 deg^2 J,H,K_s infrared survey from the 2MASS 6x program across the
extent of the optical disk of the Andromeda (M31) galaxy provides a clear view
of the M31 center almost completely unfettered by dust extinction, and reveals
a high contrast bulge with extremely boxy isophotes dominating the NIR light to
a semi-major axis of ~700''(2.6 kpc). The inner bulge (<~50'') is relatively
circular, but shows some isophotal twisting. Beyond this, the ellipticity and
boxiness of the bulge increase with radius -- achieving a boxiness that rivals
that of any other known disk galaxy observed in the near infrared -- and the
position angle is constant at ~50 deg, which is about 10 deg higher than the
position angle of the M31 disk. Boxy bulges in highly inclined disks have been
shown to be the vertical structure of bars, and self-consistent, N-body
modeling specific to the NIR images presented here can reproduce the observed
NIR M31 features with a combination of a classical bulge and a boxy bulge/bar.
Beyond the boxy bulge region and nearly along the 40 deg position angle of the
disk a narrow ridge of infrared flux, which can be identified with the thin
part of the bar, more or less symmetrically extends into the inner disk at
semi-major axis radii of 700'' to 1200'' or more. Little variation in the
morphology or relative brightnesses of these various M31 structures is seen
across the NIR bands (i.e., no color gradients are seen). These new data verify
that M31 is a barred spiral galaxy like the Milky Way.",2006-05-09T19:52:51Z
Brief outbursts in the dwarf nova V1316 Cygni,"Several brief outbursts were detected in the dwarf nova V1316 Cyg during
2005. These events have an average amplitude of 1.4 magnitude and a duration of
<1 to 2 days. Whilst no outburst period could be confirmed, the shortest period
between detected events is 10 days. These curious brief outbursts appear to be
the normal pattern of behaviour for this system. They are of smaller amplitude
and shorter duration than normal outbursts previously reported in this star.
V1316 Cyg appears to be a very unusual system and we suggest that further
observations by both amateur and professional astronomers could yield important
information about the underlying mechanism.",2006-05-11T07:56:27Z
"Experimental evidence for magnetorotational instability in a helical
  magnetic field","A recent paper [R. Hollerbach and G. Rudiger, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 124501
(2005)] has shown that the threshold for the onset of the magnetorotational
instability (MRI) in a Taylor-Couette flow is dramatically reduced if both
axial and azimuthal magnetic fields are imposed. In agreement with this
prediction, we present results of a Taylor-Couette experiment with the liquid
metal alloy GaInSn, showing evidence for the existence of the MRI at Reynolds
numbers of order 1000 and Hartmann numbers of order 10.",2006-06-20T11:19:24Z
"Neon Abundances in B-Stars of the Orion Association: Solving the Solar
  Model Problem?","We report on non-LTE Ne abundances for a sample of B-type stellar members of
the Orion Association. The abundances were derived by means of non-LTE fully
metal-blanketed model atmospheres and extensive model atoms with updated atomic
data. We find that these young stars have a very homogeneous abundance of A(Ne)
= 8.27 +/- 0.05. This abundance is higher by ~0.4 dex than currently adopted
solar value, A(Ne)=7.84, which is derived from lines produced in the corona and
active regions. The general agreement between the abundances of C, N, and O
derived for B stars with the solar abundances of these elements derived from
3-D hydrodynamical models atmospheres strongly suggests that the abundance
patterns of the light elements in the Sun and B stars are broadly similar. If
this hypothesis is true, then the Ne abundance derived here is the same within
the uncertainties as the value required to reconcile solar models with
helioseismological observations.",2006-06-29T20:02:50Z
Modeling dark energy with a top-down approach,"We investigate a top-down approach for modeling the dark energy where we fit
the luminosity distances directly rather than indirectly fitting the equation

The Correlation Dimension of Young Stars in Dwarf Galaxies,"We present the correlation dimension of resolved young stars in four actively
star-forming dwarf galaxies that are sufficiently resolved and transparent to
be modeled as projections of three-dimensional point distributions. We use data
in the Hubble Space Telescope archive; photometry for one of them, UGCA 292, is
presented here for the first time. We find that there are statistically
distinguishable differences in the nature of stellar clustering among the
sample galaxies. The young stars of VII Zw 403, the brightest galaxy in the
sample, have the highest value for the correlation dimension and also the most
dramatic decrease with logarithmic scale, falling from $1.68\pm0.14$ to
$0.10\pm0.05$ over less than a factor of ten in $r$. This decrease is
consistent with the edge effect produced by a projected Poisson distribution
within a 2:2:1 ellipsoid. The young stars in UGC 4483, the faintest galaxy in
the sample, exhibit very different behavior, with a constant value of about 0.5
over this same range in $r$, extending nearly to the edge of the distribution.
This behavior may indicate either a scale-free distribution with an unusually
low correlation dimension, or a two-component (not scale-free) combination of
cluster and field stars.",2006-08-04T14:41:58Z
Planetary Nebulae as Mass Tracers in Galaxies,"Planetary nebula are useful kinematic tracers of the stars in all galaxy
types. I review recent observationally-driven developments in the study of
galaxy mass profiles. These have yielded surprising results on spiral galaxy

coupling between PNe and the underlying stellar populations.",2006-05-10T21:00:35Z
"Imaging Across the Spectrum: Synergies Between SKA and Other Future
  Telescopes","The Square Kilometer Array will be operating at the same time with several
new large optical, X-ray and Gamma-ray facilities currently under construction
or planned. Fostering synergies in astrophysical research made across different

it would offer imaging capabilities similar to those of other future

major future astrophysical facilities.",2006-06-07T10:19:32Z
"NGC 7419: A young open cluster with a number of very young intermediate
  mass pre-MS stars","We present a photometric and spectroscopic study of the young open cluster
NGC 7419, which is know to host a large number of classical Be stars for
reasons not well understood. Based on CCD photometric observations of 327 stars
in UBV passbands, we estimated the cluster parameters as, reddening E(B-V) =
1.65 +/- 0.15 mag and distance = 2900 +/- 400 pc. The turn off age of the
cluster was estimated as 25 +/- 5 Myr using isochrone fits. UBV data of the
stars were combined with JHK data from 2MASS and were used to create the near
infrared (NIR) (J-H) vs (H-K) colour-colour diagram. A large fraction of stars
(42%) was found to have NIR excess and their location in the diagram was used
to identify them as intermediate mass pre-MS stars. The isochrone fits to
pre-MS stars in the optical colour-magnitude diagram showed that the turn-on
age of the cluster is 0.3 - 3 Myr. This indicates that there has been a recent
episode of star formation in the vicinity of the cluster. Slit-less spectra
were used to identify 27 stars which showed H-alpha in emission in the field of
the cluster, of which 6 are new identifications. All these stars were found to
show NIR excess and located closer to the region populated by Herbig Ae/Be
stars in the (J-H) vs (H-K) diagram. Slit spectra of 25 stars were obtained in
the region 3700A - 9000A. The spectral features were found to be very similar
to those of Herbig Be stars. Those stars were found to be more reddened than
the main sequence stars by 0.4 mag on an average. Thus the emission line stars
found in this cluster are more similar to the Herbig Be type stars where the
circumstellar material is the remnant of the accretion disk.",2006-04-30T12:31:29Z
"Determining Distances to Clusters of Galaxies using Resonant X-ray
  Emission Lines","Bright clusters of galaxies can be seen out to cosmological distances, and
thus they can be used to derive cosmological parameters. Although the continuum
X-ray emission from the intra-cluster gas is optically thin, the optical depth
of resonant lines of ions of heavy elements can be larger than unity. In this
Letter we study the feasibility of deriving distances to clusters of galaxies
by determining the spatial distribution of the intra-cluster gas from X-ray
imaging and the optical depth from resonant emission lines (the XREL method).
We solve the radiative transfer problem for line scattering in the hot
intra-cluster gas using Monte Carlo simulations. We discuss the spatial and
spectral resolutions needed to use the XREL method for accurate determination
of distances, and hence cosmological parameters, and show that accurate
distances will be obtained by applying this technique with the next generation
of high resolution X-ray spectrometers.",2006-04-25T18:36:07Z
"Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite observations of comet 9P/Tempel 1
  and Deep Impact","On 4 July 2005 at 5:52 UT the Deep Impact mission successfully completed its
goal to hit the nucleus of 9P/Tempel 1 with an impactor, forming a crater on
the nucleus and ejecting material into the coma of the comet. NASA's
Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite (SWAS) observed the 1(10)-1(01)
ortho-water ground-state rotational transition in comet 9P/Tempel 1 before,
during, and after the impact. No excess emission from the impact was detected
by SWAS and we derive an upper limit of 1.8e7 kg on the water ice evaporated by
the impact. However, the water production rate of the comet showed large
natural variations of more than a factor of three during the weeks before and
after the impact. Episodes of increased activity with Q(H2O)~1e28 molecule/s
alternated with periods with low outgassing (Q(H2O)<~5e27 molecule/s). We
estimate that 9P/Tempel 1 vaporized a total of N~4.5e34 water molecules (~1.3e9
kg) during June-September 2005. Our observations indicate that only a small
fraction of the nucleus of Tempel 1 appears to be covered with active areas.
Water vapor is expected to emanate predominantly from topographic features
periodically facing the Sun as the comet rotates. We calculate that appreciable
asymmetries of these features could lead to a spin-down or spin-up of the
nucleus at observable rates.",2006-06-02T09:29:31Z
"Are short gamma-ray bursts collimated? GRB050709, a flare but no break","From the small sample of afterglow lightcurves of short duration gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs), the decays are rapid, roughly following a power-law in time. It
has been assumed that the afterglow emission in short GRBs is collimated in
jets in the same way as in long GRBs. An achromatic break in a short GRB
afterglow lightcurve would therefore be strong evidence in favour of
collimation in short GRBs. We examine the optical lightcurve of the afterglow
of the short GRB 050709, the only short GRB where a jet break has been claimed
from optical data. We show that (1) the decay follows a single power-law from
1.4 to 19 days after the burst and has a decay index alpha =
1.73_{-0.04}^{+0.11}, (2) that an optical flare at ~10 days is required by the
data, roughly contemporaneous with a flare in the X-ray data, and (3) that
there is no evidence for a break in the lightcurve. This means that so far
there is no direct evidence for collimation in the outflows of short GRBs. The
available limits on the collimation angles in short GRBs now strongly suggest
much wider opening angles than found in long GRBs.",2006-04-07T19:46:59Z
Two populations of metal-free stars in the early Universe,"We construct star formation histories at redshifts z > 5 for two physically
distinct populations of primordial, metal-free stars, motivated by theoretical
and observational arguments that have hinted towards the existence of an
intermediate stellar generation between Population III and Population I/II.
Taking into account the cosmological parameters as recently revised by WMAP
after three years of operation, we determine self-consistent reionization
histories and discuss the resulting chemical enrichment from these early
stellar generations. We find that the bulk of ionizing photons and heavy
elements produced at high redshifts must have originated in Population II.5
stars, which formed out of primordial gas in haloes with virial temperatures >=
10^4 K, and had typical masses >= 10 M_sun. Classical Population III stars,
formed in minihaloes and having masses >= 100 M_sun, on the other hand, had
only a minor impact on reionization and early metal enrichment. Specifically,
we find that only 10 per cent by mass of metal-free star formation went into
Population III.",2006-04-18T15:13:19Z
The formation of higher-order hierarchical systems in star clusters,"We simulate open clusters containing up to 182 stars initially in the form of
singles, binaries and triples. Due to the high interaction rate a large number
of stable quadruples, quintuples, sextuples, and higher-order hierarchies form
during the course of the simulations. For our choice of initial conditions, the
formation rate of quadruple systems after about 2 Myr is roughly constant with
time at $\sim 0.008$ per cluster per Myr. The formation rate of quintuple and
sextuple systems are about half and one quarter, respectively, of the quadruple
formation rate, and both rates are also approximately constant with time. We
present reaction channels and relative probabilities for the formation of
persistent systems containing up to six stars. The reaction networks for the
formation and destruction of quintuple and sextuple systems can become quite
complicated, although the branching ratios remain largely unchanged during the
course of the cluster evolution. The total number of quadruples is about a
factor of three smaller than observed in the solar neighbourhood.",2006-07-19T21:29:44Z
Imbalanced Strong MHD Turbulence,"We present a phenomenological model of imbalanced MHD turbulence in an
incompressible magnetofluid. The steady-state cascades, of waves traveling in
opposite directions along the mean magnetic field, carry unequal energy fluxes
to small length scales, where they decay due to viscous and resistive
dissipation. The inertial-range scalings are well-understood when both cascades
are weak. We study the case when both cascades are, in a sense, strong. The
inertial-range of this imbalanced cascade has the following properties: (i) the
ratio of the r.m.s. Elsasser amplitudes is independent of scale, and is equal
to the ratio of the corresponding energy fluxes; (ii) in common with the
balanced strong cascade, the energy spectra of both Elsasser waves are of the
anisotropic Kolmogorov form, with their parallel correlation lengths equal to
each other on all scales, and proportional to the two-thirds power of the
transverse correlation length; (iii) the equality of cascade time and
waveperiod (critical balance) that characterizes the strong balanced cascade
does not apply to the Elsasser field with the larger amplitude. Instead, the
more general criterion that always applies to both Elsasser fields is that the
cascade time is equal to the correlation time of the straining imposed by
oppositely-directed waves. Our results are particularly relevant for turbulence
in the solar wind. Spacecraft measurements have established that, in the
inertial range of solar wind turbulence, waves travelling away from the sun
have higher amplitudes than those travelling towards it. Result (i) allows us
to infer the turbulent flux ratios from the amplitude ratios, thus providing
insight into the origin of the turbulence.",2006-07-11T22:11:54Z
Water vapor on supergiants. The 12 micron TEXES spectra of mu Cephei,"Several recent papers have argued for warm, semi-detached, molecular layers
surrounding red giant and supergiant stars, a concept known as a MOLsphere.
Spectroscopic and interferometric analyses have often corroborated this general
picture. Here, we present high-resolution spectroscopic data of pure rotational
lines of water vapor at 12 microns for the supergiant mu Cephei. This star has
often been used to test the concept of molecular layers around supergiants.
Given the prediction of an isothermal, optically thick water-vapor layer in
Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium around the star (MOLsphere), we expected the 12
micron lines to be in emission or at least in absorption but filled in by
emission from the molecular layer around the star. Our data, however, show the
contrary; we find definite absorption. Thus, our data do not easily fit into
the suggested isothermal MOLsphere scenario. The 12 micron lines, therefore,
put new, strong constraints on the MOLsphere concept and on the nature of water
seen in signatures across the spectra of early M supergiants. We also find that
the absorption is even stronger than that calculated from a standard,
spherically symmetric model photosphere without any surrounding layers. A cool
model photosphere, representing cool outer layers is, however, able to
reproduce the lines, but this model does not account for water vapor emission
at 6 microns. Thus, a unified model for water vapor on mu Cephei appears to be
lacking. It does seem necessary to model the underlying photospheres of these
supergiants in their whole complexity. The strong water vapor lines clearly
reveal inadequacies of classical model atmospheres.",2006-03-15T09:12:33Z
"Double-Layer Silicon PIN Photodiode X-Ray Detector for a Future X-ray

"Quiet Sun magnetic fields from simultaneous inversions of visible and
  infrared spectropolarimetric observations","We study the quiet Sun magnetic fields using spectropolarimetric observations
of the infrared and visible Fe I lines at 6301.5, 6302.5, 15648 and 15653 A.
Magnetic field strengths and filling factors are inferred by the simultaneous
fit of the observed Stokes profiles under the MISMA hypothesis. The
observations cover an intra-network region at the solar disk center. We analyze
2280 Stokes profiles whose polarization signals are above noise in the two
spectral ranges, which correspond to 40% of the field of view. Most of these
profiles can be reproduced only with a model atmosphere including 3 magnetic
components with very different field strengths, which indicates the
co-existence of kG and sub-kG fields in our 1.5"" resolution elements. We
measure an unsigned magnetic flux density of 9.6 G considering the full field
of view. Half of the pixels present magnetic fields with mixed polarities in
the resolution element. The fraction of mixed polarities increases as the
polarization weakens. We compute the probability density function of finding
each magnetic field strength. It has a significant contribution of kG field
strengths, which concentrates most of the observed magnetic flux and energy.
This kG contribution has a preferred magnetic polarity, while the polarity of
the weak fields is balanced.",2006-04-18T15:14:23Z
"On Extending the Mass-Metallicity Relation of Galaxies by 2.5 Decades in
  Stellar Mass","We report 4.5 micron luminosities for 27 nearby (D < 5 Mpc) dwarf irregular
galaxies measured with the Spitzer Infrared Array Camera. We have constructed
the 4.5 micron luminosity-metallicity (L-Z) relation for 25 dwarf galaxies with
secure distance and interstellar medium oxygen abundance measurements. The 4.5
micron L-Z relation is 12+log(O/H) = (5.78 +/- 0.21) + (-0.122 +/- 0.012)
M_[4.5], where M_[4.5] is the absolute magnitude at 4.5 micron. The dispersion
in the near-infrared L-Z relation is smaller than the corresponding dispersion
in the optical L-Z relation. The subsequently derived stellar mass-metallicity
M-Z relation is 12+log(O/H) = (5.65 +/- 0.23) + (0.298 +/- 0.030) log Mstar.
and extends the SDSS M-Z relation to lower mass by about 2.5 dex. We find that
the dispersion in the M-Z relation is similar over five orders of magnitude in
stellar mass, and that the relationship between stellar mass and interstellar
medium metallicity is similarly tight from high-mass to low-mass systems. We
find a larger scatter at low mass in the relation between effective yield and
total baryonic mass. In fact, there are a few dwarf galaxies with large yields,
which is difficult to explain if galactic winds are ubiquitous in dwarf
galaxies. The low scatter in the L-Z and M-Z relationships are difficult to
understand if galactic superwinds or blowout are responsible for the low
metallicities at low mass or luminosity. Naively, one would expect an ever
increasing scatter at lower masses, which is not observed.",2006-05-01T20:00:11Z
The Impact of Cosmic Dust on Supernova Cosmology,"Extinction by intergalactic gray dust introduces a magnitude redshift
dependent offset in the standard-candle relation of SN Ia. This leads to
overestimated luminosity distances compared to a dust-free universe.
Quantifying the amplitude of this systematic effect is crucial for an accurate
determination of the dark energy parameters. In this paper we model the gray
dust extinction in terms of the star-formation history of the universe and the
physical properties of the dust grains. We focus on a class of cosmic dust
models which satisfy current observational constraints. These can produce an
extinction as large as 0.08 mag at z=1.7 and potentially disrupt the dark
energy parameter inference from future SN surveys. In particular depending on
the dust model we find that an unaccounted extinction can bias the estimation
of a constant dark energy equation of state w by shifting its best fit value up
to 20% from its true value. Near-IR broadband photometry will hardly detect
this effect, while the induced decrement of the Balmer lines requires high
signal-to-noise spectra. Indeed IR-spectroscopy will be needed for high
redshift SNe. Cosmic dust extinction may also cause a detectable violation of
the distance-duality relation. A more comprehensive knowledge of the physics of
the IGM is necessary for an accurate modeling of intergalactic dust. Due to the
large magnitude dispersion current luminosity distance measurements are
insensitive to such possible extinction effects. In contrast these must be
taken into account if we hope to disclose the true nature of dark energy with
the upcoming generation of SN Ia surveys.",2006-03-30T21:00:04Z
"A sample of low-redshift BL Lacertae objects. II. EVN and MERLIN data
  and multi-wavelength analysis","We present new radio observations of 9 members of a sample of 29 nearby (z <
0.2) BL Lac objects. The new data have been obtained with the European VLBI
Network and/or the MERLIN at 1.6 and 5 GHz and complement previous
observations. For one object, the TeV source Mrk 421, we also present deep
multi-epoch VLBA and Global VLBI data, which reveal a resolved diffuse jet,
with clear signatures of limb brightening. We use the new and old data to
estimate physical parameters of the jets of the sample from which the subset
with new radio data is drawn. We derive Doppler factors in the parsec scale
radio jet in the range ~2 < delta < ~9. Using HST data, we separate the
contribution of the host galaxy from that of the active core. From the measured
and de-beamed observables, we find a weak correlation between radio power and
black hole mass, and a tight correlation between radio and optical core
luminosities. We interpret this result in terms of a common synchrotron origin,
with little contribution from a radiatively efficient accretion disk. The BL
Lacs in our sample have de-beamed properties similar to low power radio
galaxies, including the fundamental plane of black hole activity.",2006-04-10T23:01:40Z
"Dark energy, MOND and sub-millimeter tests of gravity","We consider modifications of General Relativity obtained by adding the
logarithm of some curvature invariants to the Einstein-Hilbert action. These
non-linear actions can explain the late-time acceleration of the universe
giving an expansion history that differs from that of a pure cosmological
constant. We show that they also modify the Newtonian potential below a fixed
acceleration scale given by the late-time Hubble constant times the speed of
light. This is exactly what is required in MOND, a phenomenological
modification of the Newtonian potential that is capable of explaining galactic
rotation curves without the need to introduce dark matter. We show that this
kind of modification also predicts short distance deviations of Newton's law at
the sub-mm scale and an anomalous shift in the precession of the Moon's orbit
around the Earth, both effects of a size that is less than an order of
magnitude below current bounds.",2006-05-12T17:11:40Z
Gallery of Planetary Nebula Spectra,"We present the Gallery of Planetary Nebula Spectra now available at
http://oit.williams.edu/nebulae The website offers high-quality, moderate
resolution (~7-10 A FWHM) spectra of 128 Galactic planetary nebulae from
3600-9600 A, obtained by Kwitter, Henry, and colleagues with the Goldcam
spectrograph at the KPNO 2.1-m or with the RC spectrograph at the CTIO 1.5-m.
The master PN table contains atlas data and an image link. A selected object's
spectrum is displayed in a zoomable window; line identification templates are
provided. In addition to the spectra themselves, the website also contains a
brief discussion of PNe as astronomical objects and as contributors to our
understanding of stellar evolution. We envision that this website, which
concentrates a large amount of data in one place, will be of interest to a
variety of users: researchers might need to check the spectrum of a particular
object of interest; the non-specialist astronomer might simply be interested in
perusing such a collection of spectra; and finally, teachers of introductory
astronomy can use this database to illustrate basic principles of atomic
physics and radiation. To particularly encourage this last use, we have
developed two paper-and-pencil exercises to introduce beginning astronomy
students to the wealth of information that PN spectra contain.",2006-05-01T20:12:08Z
2MASS wide field extinction maps - I. The Pipe nebula,"We present a 8 deg x 6 deg, high resolution extinction map of the Pipe nebula
using 4.5 million stars from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) point source
catalog. The use of NICER, a robust and optimal technique to map the dust
column density, allows us to detect a Av = 0.5 mag extinction at a 3-sigma
level with a 1 arcmin resolution. We find for the Pipe nebula a normal
reddening law, E(J-H) = (1.85 +/- 0.15) E(H-K). We measure the cloud distance
using Hipparchos and Tycho parallaxes, and obtain ~130 pc. This, together with
the total estimated mass, 10^4 Msun, makes the Pipe the closest massive cloud
complex to Earth. We compare the NICER extinction map to the NANTEN 12CO
observations and derive with unprecedented accuracy the relationship between
the near-infrared extinction and the 12CO column density and hence (indirectly)
the 12CO X-factor, that we estimate to be 2.91 10^20 cm^-2 K^-1 km^-1 s in the
range Av <- [0.9, 5.4] mag. We identify ~1500 OH/IR stars located within the
Galactic bulge in the direction of the Pipe field. This represents a
significant increase of the known numbers of such stars in the Galaxy. Our
analysis confirms the power and simplicity of the color excess technique to
study molecular clouds. The comparison with the NANTEN 12CO data corroborates
the insensitivity of CO observations to low column densities (up to
approximately 2 mag in Av), and shows also an irreducible uncertainty in the
dust-CO correlation of about 1 mag of visual extinction.",2006-06-27T23:22:31Z
Modifying gravity with the Aether: an alternative to Dark Matter,"There is evidence that Newton and Einstein's theories of gravity cannot
explain the dynamics of a universe made up solely of baryons and radiation. To
be able to understand the properties of galaxies, clusters of galaxies and the
universe on the whole it has become commonplace to invoke the presence of dark
matter. An alternative approach is to modify the gravitational field equations
to accommodate observations. We propose a new class of gravitational theories
in which we add a new degree of freedom, the Aether, in the form of a vector
field that is coupled covariantly, but non-minimally, with the space-time
metric. We explore the Newtonian and non-Newtonian limits, discuss the
conditions for these theories to be consistent and explore their effect on
cosmology.",2006-07-18T12:43:44Z
Shoemaker-Levy 9 Impact Modeling: I. High-Resolution 3D Bolides,"We have run high-resolution, three-dimensional, hydrodynamic simulations of
the impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 into the atmosphere of Jupiter. We find
that the energy deposition profile is largely similar to the previous
two-dimensional calculations of Mac Low and Zahnle (1994), though perhaps
somewhat broader in the range of height over which the energy is deposited. As
with similar calculations for impacts into the Venusian atmosphere, there is
considerable sensitivity in the results to small changes in the initial
conditions, indicating dynamical chaos. We calculated the median depth of
energy deposition (the height z at which 50% of the bolide's energy has been
released) per run. The mean value among runs is approx 70 km below the 1-bar
level, for a 1-km diameter impactor of porous ice of density rho=0.6 g cm^{-3}.
The standard deviation among these runs is 14 km. We find little evidence of a
trend in these results with the resolution of the calculations (up to 57 cells
across the impactor radius, or 8.8-m resolution), suggesting that resolutions
as low as 16 grid cells across the radius of the bolide may yield good results
for this particular quantity.",2006-04-04T20:15:55Z
"On the Similarity between Cluster and Galactic Stellar Initial Mass
  Functions","The stellar initial mass functions (IMFs) for the Galactic bulge, the Milky
Way, other galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and the integrated stars in the
Universe are composites from countless individual IMFs in star clusters and
associations where stars form. These galaxy-scale IMFs, reviewed in detail
here, are not steeper than the cluster IMFs except in rare cases. This is true
even though low mass clusters generally outnumber high mass clusters and the
average maximum stellar mass in a cluster scales with the cluster mass. The
implication is that the mass distribution function for clusters and
associations is a power law with a slope of -2 or shallower. Steeper slopes,
even by a few tenths, upset the observed equality between large and small scale
IMFs. Such a cluster function is expected from the hierarchical nature of star
formation, which also provides independent evidence for the IMF equality when
it is applied on sub-cluster scales. We explain these results with analytical
expressions and Monte Carlo simulations. Star clusters appear to be the relaxed
inner parts of a widespread hierarchy of star formation and cloud structure.
They are defined by their own dynamics rather than pre-existing cloud
boundaries.",2006-05-19T23:57:38Z
"Anomalous H_2CO Absorption Towards the Galactic Anticenter: A Blind
  Search for Dense Molecular Clouds","We have carried out a blind search in the general direction of the Galactic
Anticenter for absorption of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation
near 4.83 GHz by molecular clouds containing gaseous ortho-formaldehyde
(H_2CO). The observations were done using the 25-m radio telescope at Onsala in
Sweden, and covered strips in Galactic latitude -1 < b < +1 at several
longitudes in the region 170 < l < 190 . Spectra were obtained in these strips
with a grid spacing corresponding to the telescope resolution of 10'. We have
detected H_2CO CMB absorption at ~ 10% of the survey pointings. This detection
rate is likely to increase with further improvements in sensitivity, and may
become comparable to the detection rate expected from a blind CO survey with a
corresponding sensitivity limit. We have mapped some of these detections in
more detail and compared the H_2CO absorption to existing maps of CO(1-0)
emission in the same regions. There appears to be a rough correlation between
the velocity-integrated line strength of the CO(1-0) emission and that of the
H_2CO absorption. However, the scatter in this correlation is significantly
larger than the measurement errors, indicating differences of detail at and
below the linear resolution of our observations (~ 4 - 9 pc). Although these
two tracers are expected to have similar excitation requirements on the
microscopic level characteristic of warm, T_K > 10K, dense, 10^3 < n < 10^5
cm^{-3} condensations in molecular clouds, the CO(1-0) line is expected to be
optically thick, whereas the H_2CO line is not. This latter difference is
likely to be responsible for a significant part of the scatter in the
correlation we have found.",2006-07-27T14:44:53Z
Non-gaussianity for a Two Component Hybrid Model of Inflation,"We consider a two component hybrid inflation model, in which two fields drive
inflation. Our results show that this model generates an observable
non-gaussian contribution to the curvature spectrum, within the limits allowed
by the recent WMAP year 3 data. We show that if one field has a mass less than
zero, and an initial field value less than 0.06Mpl while the other field has a
mass greater than zero, and initial field value ranging between 0.5Mpl and Mpl
then the non-gaussianity is observable with 1<fnl<1.5, but that fnl becomes
much less than the observable limit should we take both masses to have the same
sign, or if we loosened the constraints on the initial field values.",2006-04-28T14:41:04Z
"A Revised Prescription for the Tayler-Spruit Dynamo: Magnetic Angular
  Momentum Transport in Stars","Angular momentum transport by internal magnetic fields is an important
ingredient for stellar interior models. In this paper we critically examine the
basic heuristic assumptions in the model of the Tayler-Spruit dynamo, which
describes how a pinch-type instability of a toroidal magnetic field in
differentially rotating stellar radiative zones may result in large-scale fluid
motion. We agree with prior published work both on the existence of the
instability and its nearly horizontal geometry for perturbations. However, the
approximations in the original Acheson dispersion relation are valid only for
small length scales, and we disagree that the dispersion relation can be
extrapolated to horizontal length scales of order the radius of the star. We
contend that dynamical effects, in particular angular momentum conservation,
limit the maximum horizontal length scale. We therefore present transport
coefficients for chemical mixing and angular momentum redistribution by
magnetic torques that are significantly different from previous published
values. The new magnetic viscosity is reduced by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude
compared to the old one, and we find that magnetic angular momentum transport
by this mechanism is very sensitive to gradients in the mean molecular weight.
The revised coefficients are more compatible with empirical constraints on the
timescale of core-envelope coupling in young stars than the previous ones.
However, solar models including only this mechanism possess a rapidly rotating
core, in contradiction with helioseismic data. (abridged)",2006-04-03T21:07:26Z
"Post processing of differential images for direct extrasolar planet
  detection from the ground","The direct imaging from the ground of extrasolar planets has become today a
major astronomical and biological focus. This kind of imaging requires
simultaneously the use of a dedicated high performance Adaptive Optics [AO]
system and a differential imaging camera in order to cancel out the flux coming
from the star. In addition, the use of sophisticated post-processing techniques
is mandatory to achieve the ultimate detection performance required. In the
framework of the SPHERE project, we present here the development of a new
technique, based on Maximum A Posteriori [MAP] approach, able to estimate
parameters of a faint companion in the vicinity of a bright star, using the
multi-wavelength images, the AO closed-loop data as well as some knowledge on
non-common path and differential aberrations. Simulation results show a 10^-5
detectivity at 5sigma for angular separation around 15lambda/D with only two
images.",2006-06-14T11:38:20Z
Probing the Pulsar Wind Nebula of PSR B0355+54,"We present XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray observations of the middle-aged radio
pulsar PSR B0355+54. Our X-ray observations reveal emission not only from the
pulsar itself, but also from a compact diffuse component extending ~50'' in the
opposite direction to the pulsar's proper motion. There is also evidence for
the presence of fainter diffuse emission extending ~5' from the point source.
The compact diffuse feature is well-fitted with a power-law, the index of which
is consistent with the values found for other pulsar wind nebulae. The
morphology of the diffuse component is similar to the ram-pressure confined
pulsar wind nebulae detected for other sources. The X-ray emission from the
pulsar itself is described well by a thermal plus power-law fit, with the
thermal emission most likely originating in a hot polar cap.",2006-05-03T11:23:23Z
"Spatially Resolved Spitzer Spectroscopy of the Starburst Nucleus in NGC
  5253","We present new Spitzer Space Telescope data on the nearby, low-metallicity
starburst galaxy NGC 5253, from the Infrared Array Camera IRAC and the Infrared
Spectrograph IRS. The mid-IR luminosity profile of NGC 5253 is clearly
dominated by an unresolved cluster near the center, which outshines the rest of
the galaxy at longer wavelengths. We find that the [NeIII]/[NeII] ratio
decreases from $\sim8.5$ at the center to $\sim2.5$ at a distance of $\sim250$
pc. The [SIV]/[SIII] follows the [NeIII]/[NeII] ratio remarkably well, being
about 4-5 times lower at all distances. Our spectra reveal for the first time
PAH emission feature at 11.3$\mu$m and its equivalent width increases
significantly with distance from the center. The good anti-correlation between
the PAH strength and the product between hardness and luminosity of the UV
radiation field suggests photo-destruction of the PAH molecules in the central
region. The high-excitation [OIV]25.91$\mu$m line was detected at
$0.42\times10^{-20}$W cm$^{-2}$. Our results demonstrate the importance of
spatially resolved mid-IR spectroscopy.",2006-04-26T09:08:10Z
