Title,Abstract,Published Date
"Subaru Super Deep Field with Adaptive Optics I. Observations and First
  Implications","We present a deep $K^{\prime}$-band (2.12$\mu$m) imaging of 1\arcmin\
$\times$ 1\arcmin Subaru Super Deep Field (SSDF) taken with the Subaru adaptive
optics (AO) system. Total integration time of 26.8 hours results in the
limiting magnitude of $K^{\prime} \sim 24.7$ (5$\sigma$, 0\farcs2 aperture) for
point sources and $K^{\prime} \sim 23.5$ (5$\sigma$, 0\farcs6 aperture) for
galaxies, which is the deepest limit ever achieved in the $K^{\prime}$ band.
The average stellar FWHM of the co-added image is 0\farcs18. Based on the
photometric measurements of detected galaxies, we obtained the differential
galaxy number counts, for the first time, down to $K^{\prime} \sim 25$, which
is more than 0.5 mag deeper than the previous data. We found that the number
count slope $d\log N/dm$ is about 0.15 at $22 < K^{\prime} < 25$, which is
flatter than the previous data. Therefore, detected galaxies in the SSDF have
only negligible contribution to the near-infrared extragalactic background
light (EBL), and the discrepancy claimed so far between the diffuse EBL
measurements and the estimated EBL from galaxy count integration has become
more serious . The size distribution of detected galaxies was obtained down to
the area size of less than 0.1 arcsec$^2$, which is less than a half of the
previous data in the $K^{\prime}$ band. We compared the observed size-magnitude
relation with a simple pure luminosity evolution model allowing for intrinsic
size evolution, and found that a model with no size evolution gives the best
fit to the data. It implies that the surface brightness of galaxies at high
redshift is not much different from that expected from the size-luminosity
relation of present-day galaxies.",2005-05-17T15:12:42Z
"Lifting the Iron Curtain : Toward an Understanding of the Iron Stars XX
  Oph and AS 325","We present new optical, near infrared, and archival ultraviolet observations
of XX Ophiuchi and AS 325, two proposed iron stars. These unusual stars have
optical spectra dominated by emission lines arising from hydrogen as well as
ionized metals such as iron, chromium, and titanium. Both stars have been
classified as iron stars and a number of exotic models have been presented for
their origin. Using two years of moderately high resolution optical
spectroscopy, the first high signal-to-noise K-band spectroscopy of these
sources (which reveals stellar photospheric absorption lines), and new
near-infrared interferometric observations, we confirm that both systems are
composed of two stars, likely binaries, containing a hot Be star with an
evolved late-type secondary. The hydrogen emission features arise in the hot
wind from the Be star while the corresponding P-Cygni absorption lines are
produced from dense material in the expanding, radiation driven, wind around
each system. The optical FeII emission lines are pumped by ultraviolet FeII
absorption lines through fluorescence. Contrary to some claims in the
literature, the spectral features of XX Oph and AS 325 are quite similar,
evidence that they are comparable systems. We examine the variability of the
spectral morphology and radial velocity motions of both sources. We also study
the variability of XX Oph during a major photometric event and find that the
spectral nature of the system varies during the event. A comparison of the
velocity of the absorption line components in our new spectra with those in the
literature show that the structure of the stellar wind from XX Oph has changed
since the system was observed in 1951.",2005-02-17T00:52:47Z
"Cooling of Quark Stars in the Color Superconductive Phase: Effect of
  Photons from Glueball decay","The cooling history of a quark star in the color superconductive phase is
investigated. Here we specifically focus on the 2-flavour color (2SC) phase
where novel process of photon generation via glueball (GLB) decay have been
already investigated (Ouyed & Sannino 2001). The picture we present here can in
principle be generalized to quark stars entering a superconductive phase where
similar photon generation mechanisms are at play. As much as 10^{45}-10^{47}
erg of energy is provided by the GLB decay in the 2SC phase. The generated
photons slowly diffuse out of the quark star keeping it hot and radiating as a
black-body (with possibly a Wien spectrum in gamma-rays) for millions of years.
We discuss hot radio-quiet isolated neutron stars in our picture (such as RX
J185635-3754 and RX J0720.4-3125) and argue that their nearly blackbody spectra
(with a few broad features) and their remarkably tiny hydrogen atmosphere are
indications that these might be quark stars in the color superconductive phase
where some sort of photon generation mechanism (reminiscent of the GLB decay)
has taken place. Fits to observed data of cooling compact stars favor models
with superconductive gaps of Delta_2SC = 15-35 MeV and densities
rho_2SC=(2.5-3.0)rho_N (rho_N being the nuclear matter saturation density) for
quark matter in the 2SC phase. If correct, our model combined with more
observations of isolated compact stars could provide vital information to
studies of quark matter and its exotic phases.",2005-04-18T14:41:46Z
"Fragmentation and Evolution of Molecular Clouds. I: Algorithm and First
  Results","We present a series of simulations of the fragmentation of a molecular cloud,
leading to the formation of a cluster of protostellar cores. The purpose of
these simulations is to address a specific numerical problem called artificial
fragmentation, that plagues SPH simulations of cloud fragmentation. We argue
that this is a serious problem that needs to be addressed, and that the only
reasonable and practical way to address it is to use a relatively new technique
called particle splitting. Our largest simulation has an effective resolution
of 256^3 particles (much higher than most previous SPH simulations of cloud
fragmentation) and results in the formation of a dense cluster containing ~3000
protostellar cores. It is the first simulation of this kind to properly resolve
the Jeans mass throughout the entire system, at all times, thus preventing
artificial fragmentation.",2005-04-30T17:58:42Z
"Constraints from Galaxy-AGN Clustering on the Correlation between Galaxy
  and Black Hole Mass at Redshifts 2<Z<3","We use the clustering of galaxies around distant active-galactic nuclei to
derive an estimate of the relationship between galaxy and black hole mass that
obtained during the ancient quasar epoch, at redshifts 2 <~ z <~ 3, when giant
black holes accreted much of their mass. Neither the mean relationship nor its
scatter differs significantly from what is observed in the local universe, at
least over the ranges of apparent magnitude (16 <~ G_AB <~ 26) and black-hole
mass (10^6 <~ M_BH/M_sun <~ 10^10.5) that we are able to probe.",2005-05-26T22:46:45Z
109 new Galactic open clusters,"We present a list of 130 Galactic Open Clusters, found in the All-Sky
Compiled Catalogue of 2.5 Million Stars (ASCC-2.5). For these clusters we
determined and publish a homogeneous set of astrophysical parameters such as
size, membership, motion, distance and age. In a previous work 520 already
known open clusters out of the sample of 1700 clusters from the literature were
confirmed in the ASCC-2.5 using independent, objective methods. Using these
methods the whole sky was systematically screened for the search of new
clusters. The newly detected clusters show the same distribution over the sky
as the known ones. It is found, that without the {\em a-priori} knowledge about
existing clusters our search lead to clusters which are, {\em on average},
brighter, have more members and cover larger angular radii than the 520
previously known ones.",2005-05-02T13:33:38Z
"Observational evidence of the formation of cyanopolyynes in CRL618
  through the polimerization of HCN","The abundance ratio of consecutive members of the cyanopolyynes family has
been explored in CRL618 using data acquired in a complete line survey covering
the frequency range 81-356 GHz. The Jup range explored for the different
molecules is the following: 1 to 4 for HCN and HNC, 9 to 39 for HC3N, 31 to 133
for HC5N, and 72 to 85 for HC7N (not detected beyond Jup=85). The lowest
vibrationally excited state of HC7N (nu_15 at 62 cm^-1) has been tentatively
detected. Data analysis has been performed by extending our previous
geometrical and radiative transfer model of the slowly expanding envelope (SEE)
surrounding the compact central continuum source of CRL 618, that was
established from the study of rotational lines in several vibrationally excited
states of HC_3N. The new lines analyzed here require to model the high velocity
wind (HVW) component and the colder circumstellar gas, remnant of the AGB phase
of CRL618. The derived HC3N/HC5N and HC5N/HC7N abundance ratios from this set
of uniformly calibrated lines are between 3 and 6 in the different regions,
similar to standard values in the CSM and ISM, and consistent with previous
estimates obtained from ISO observations and chemical models. However, the
abundance ratios of HC3N, HC5N and HC7N with respect to HCN are at least two
orders of magnitude larger than those typical for AGB C-rich stars, such as
IRC+10216. This fact indicates that, in the short transition toward the
Planetary Nebula phase, HCN is quickly reprocessed into longer cyanopolyyne
chains. A similar behavior was previously found in this object for the
polyacetylenic chains (C(2n)H2).",2005-04-11T10:09:33Z
"The Connection between Ultraviolet and X-ray Outflows in AGN: the case
  of PDS 456","High-velocity outflows from AGN are a well-known phenomena in terms of the
Broad Absorption Lines seen in the UV/optical. More recently, similar, possibly
related, outflows have been reported in the X-ray. The most extreme example is
seen in the nearby, luminous QSO PDS 456, which displays a massive, high
velocity (50000 km s-1), high-ionization X-ray outflow of 10 solar masses yr-1.
Here we present the UV spectrum of PDS 456 as observed by the Hubble Space
Telescope. We find the UV spectrum is also extreme, displaying very broad
emission-lines, with CIV 1549 blueshifted by 5000 km s-1 and a broad Ly-alpha
absorption trough blueshifted by 14000-24000 km s-1. No strong, broad
high-ionization absorption features are seen. We interpret the combined UV and
X-ray spectrum of PDS 456 as the signature of a decelerating, cooling outflow,
which may be driven by radiation and/or magnetic field. This outflow may be the
source of some of the broad emission and absorption-line gas.",2005-03-14T12:39:13Z
"VLT-FORS1 Imaging Polarimetry of M83 (NGC 5236) - I. Search for Light
  Echoes from Historical Supernovae","We have used FORS1 at the ESO VLT to search for light echoes in imaging
polarimetry from four historical supernovae in the face-on nearby spiral galaxy
M83 (NGC 5236). No echoes were detected around our targets (SN 1923A, SN 1945B,
SN 1950B and SN 1957D). This implies that the interstellar medium in their
environs is rather tenuous (a few particles/cm^3), possibly as a result of
previous supernova explosions that could have cleared the immediate vicinities
of our targets. The merits and limitations of searching for light echoes in
imaging polarimetry are discussed. From the photometry of the sources detected
at the supernova locations, we estimate star cluster masses of 720, 400, 300 Mo
for the cluster progenitors of SN 1957D, SN 1923A, and SN 1950B, respectively,
and an upper limit of few tens of solar masses for SN 1945B.",2005-05-05T15:00:14Z
Polarisation profiles of southern pulsars at 3.1 GHz,"We present polarisation profiles for 48 southern pulsars observed with the
new 10-cm receiver at the Parkes telescope. We have exploited the low system
temperature and high bandwidth of the receiver to obtain profiles which have
good signal to noise for most of our sample at this relatively high frequency.
Although, as expected, a number of profiles are less linearly polarised at 3.1
GHz than at lower frequencies, we identify some pulsars and particular
components of profiles in other pulsars which have increased linear
polarisation at this frequency. We discuss the dependence of linear
polarisation with frequency in the context of a model in which emission
consists of the superposition of two, orthogonally polarised modes. We show
that a simple model, in which the orthogonal modes have different spectral
indices, can explain many of the observed properties of the frequency evolution
of both the linear polarisation and the total power, such as the high degree of
linear polarisation seen at all frequencies in some high spin-down, young
pulsars. Nearly all the position angle profiles show deviations from the
rotating vector model; this appears to be a general feature of high-frequency
polarisation observations.",2005-02-17T01:28:01Z
"Anti-de Sitter curvature radius constrained by quasars in brane-world
  scenarios","This paper is intended to investigate the luminosity due to accretion of gas
in supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the center of quasars, using a
brane-world scenario naturally endowed with extra dimensions, whereon theories
formulated introduce corrections in the field equations at high energies. SMBHs
possess the necessary highly energetic environment for the introduction of
these corrections, which are shown to produce small deviations in all SMBH
properties and, consequentely, corrections in the accretion theory that
supports quasars radiative processes. The radiative flux observed from quasars
indicates these deviations, from which the magnitude of the AdS$_5$ bulk
curvature radius, and consequently the extra dimension compactification radius
is estimated.",2005-05-06T18:10:28Z
"Chandra Detection of the First X-ray Forest along the Line of Sight To
  Mkn 421","We present the first >=3.5 sigma (conservative) or >=5.8 sigma (sum of lines
significance) detection of two Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM) filaments
at z>0, which we find along the line of sight to the blazar Mkn 421. These
systems are detected through highly ionized resonant metal absorption in high
quality Chandra-ACIS and -HRC Low Energy Transmission Grating (LETG) spectra of
Mkn 421, obtained following our two Target of Opportunity requests during two
outburst phases.
  The two intervening WHIM systems that we detect, have OVII and NVII columns
of N(OVII)=(1.0 +/- 0.3) x 1e15 cm-2} N(NVII)=(0.8 +/- 0.4) x 1e15 cm-2, and
N(OVII)=(0.7 +/- 0.3) x 1e15 cm-2, N(NVII)=(1.4 +/- 0.5) x 1e15 cm-2
respectively.
  From the detected number of WHIM filaments along this line of sight we can
estimate the number of OVII filaments per unit redshift with columns larger
than 7e14 cm-2, dP(OVII)/dz(N(OVII)>=7e14) = 67^{+88}_{-43}, consistent, within
the large 1-sigma errors, with the hydrodynamical simulation predictions of
dP(OVII)/dz(N(OVII)>=7e14) = 30. Finally, we measure a cosmological mass
density of X-ray WHIM filaments Omega_b = 0.027^{+0.038}_{-0.019} x
10^{[O/H]_{-1}}, consistent with both model predictions and the estimated
number of 'missing' baryons at low redshift.",2005-04-07T18:37:31Z
"Elemental Abundance Ratios in Stars of the Outer Galactic Disk. II.
  Field Red Giants","We summarize a selection process to identify red giants in the direction of
the southern warp of the Galactic disk, employing VI_C photometry and
multi-object spectroscopy. We also present results from follow-up
high-resolution, high-S/N echelle spectroscopy of three field red giants,
finding [Fe/H] values of about -0.5. The field stars, with Galactocentric
distances estimated at 10 to 15 kpc, support the conclusion of Yong, Carney, &
de Almeida (2005) that the Galactic metallicity gradient disappears beyond R_GC
values of 10 to 12 kpc for the older stars and clusters of the outer disk. The
field and cluster stars at such large distances show very similar abundance
patterns, and, in particular, all show enhancements of the ""alpha"" elements O,
Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti and the r-process element Eu. These results suggest that
Type II supernovae have been significant contributors to star formation in the
outer disk relative to Type Ia supernovae within the past few Gyrs. We also
compare our results with those available for much younger objects. The limited
results for the H II regions and B stars in the outer disk also suggest that
the radial metallicity gradient in the outer disk is shallow or absent. The
much more extensive results for Cepheids confirm these trends, and that the
change in slope of the metallicity gradient may occur at a larger
Galactocentric distance than for the older stars and clusters. However, the
younger stars also show rising alpha element enhancements with increasing R_GC,
at least beyond 12 kpc. These trends are consistent with the idea of a
progressive growth in the size of the Galactic disk with time, and episodic
enrichment by Type II supernovae as part of the disk's growth. [Abridged]",2005-06-09T16:23:24Z
Metallicity Estimates for Old Star Clusters in M33,"Using the theoretical stellar population synthesis models of BC96, Kong et
al. (2003) showed that some BATC colors and color indices could be used to
disentangle the age and metallicity effect. They found that there is a very
good relation between the flux ratio of L_{8510}/L_{9170} and the metallicity
for stellar populations older than 1 Gyr. In this paper, based on the Kong et
al. results and on the multicolor spectrophotometry of Ma et al. (2001,
2002a,b,c), we estimate the metallicities of 31 old star clusters in the nearby
spiral galaxy M33, 23 of which are ``true'' globular clusters. The results show
that most of these old clusters are metal poor. We also find that the ages and
metal abundance for these old star clusters of M33 do not vary with deprojected
radial position.",2005-03-29T10:05:01Z
"Morphologies of Ultracompact HII Regions in W49A and Sgr B2: Prevalence
  of Shells and a Modified Classification Scheme","We have used Very Large Array (VLA) observations of the massive star forming
regions W49A and Sgr B2, obtained with resolutions from 2\farcs0 to 0\farcs04,
to classify the morphologies of nearly 100 ultracompact HII regions. These high
resolution, multi-frequency, multi-configuration VLA observations motivate
several modifications of the existing morphological classification scheme for
UC HII regions. In this work, we describe the modified morphology scheme and
the criteria used in source classification. In particular, we drop the
``core-halo'' classification, add a ``bipolar'' classification, and change the
shell classification to ``shell-like''. We tally the percentage of each
morphology found in the Sgr B2 and W49A regions and find broad agreement with
the Galactic plane surveys in the distribution of morphologies for most types.
However, we find that nearly a third of the sources in these regions are
shell-like, which is a higher percentage by nearly a factor of ten than found
in the surveys of Galactic plane star forming regions by Wood & Churchwell
(1989a) and Kurtz et al. (1994). This difference may be due to physical
differences in the environments of these two extreme star forming regions.
Alternatively, differences in observational technique may be responsible.",2005-04-10T14:20:42Z
Spiral density wave generation by vortices in Keplerian flows,"We perform a detailed analytical and numerical study of the dynamics of
perturbations (vortex/aperiodic mode, Rossby and spiral-density waves) in 2D
compressible disks with a Keplerian law of rotation. We draw attention to the
process of spiral-density wave generation from vortices, discussing, in
particular, the initial, most peculiar stages of wave emission. We show that
the linear phenomenon of wave generation by vortices in smooth (without
inflection points) shear flows found by using the so-called non-modal approach,
is directly applicable to the present case. After an analytical non-modal
description of the physics and characteristics of the spiral-density wave
generation/propagation in the local shearing-sheet model, we follow the process
of wave generation by small amplitude coherent circular vortex structures, by
direct global numerical simulation, describing the main features of the
generated waves.",2005-03-22T14:12:01Z
"Discovery of multiple ultraluminous X-ray sources in the galaxy KUG
  0214-057","We report the serendipitous discovery of several unresolved X-ray sources
lying in the prominent spiral arms of the galaxy KUG 0214-057 in XMM-Newton
observations. The location of these X-ray sources strongly suggests that at
least three, and possibly four, of these may be physically related to the
galaxy. The luminosity of each of these sources at the distance of KUG 0214-057
is > 5 x 10^39 erg/s (0.3-10 keV), making each a strong candidate ultraluminous
X-ray source (ULX). Using the ULXs as a metric implies that this relatively
low-mass galaxy may be experiencing rather intense starburst activity. The
serendipitous discovery of these ULXs suggests that such objects are not a
negligible component of the overall extragalactic X-ray source population.",2005-04-15T16:39:07Z
The star formation history of damped Lyman alpha absorbers,"The local power law relationship between the surface densities of neutral
hydrogen gas and star formation rate (SFR) can be used to explore the SFR
properties of damped Lyman alpha (DLA) systems at higher redshift. We find that
while the SFR densities for DLA systems are consistent with luminous star
forming galaxies at redshifts below z~0.6, at higher redshifts their SFR
density is too low for them to provide a significant contribution to the cosmic
star formation history (SFH). This suggests that the majority of DLAs may be a
distinct population from the Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) or submillimeter
star-forming galaxies that together dominate the SFR density at high redshift.
It is also possible that the DLAs do not trace the bulk of the neutral gas at
high redshift. The metallicity properties of DLAs are consistent with this
interpretation. The DLAs show a metal mass density lower by two orders of
magnitude at all redshifts than that inferred from the SFH of the universe.
These results are consistent with DLAs being dominated by low mass systems
having low SFRs or a late onset of star formation, similar to the star
formation histories of dwarf galaxies in the local universe.",2005-05-19T19:53:16Z
Interstellar Grains -- The 75th Anniversary,"The year of 2005 marks the 75th anniversary since Trumpler (1930) provided
the first definitive proof of interstellar grains by demonstrating the
existence of general absorption and reddening of starlight in the galactic
plane. This article reviews our progressive understanding of the nature of
interstellar dust.",2005-03-25T21:26:39Z
Results of a Search for Cold Flows of Dark Matter Axions,"Theoretical arguments predict that the distribution of cold dark matter in
spiral galaxies has peaks in velocity space associated with non-thermalized
flows of dark matter particles. We searched for the corresponding peaks in the
spectrum of microwave photons from axion to photon conversion in the cavity
detector of dark matter axions. We found none and place limits on the density
of any local flow of axions as a function of the flow velocity dispersion over
the axion mass range 1.98 to 2.17 $\mu$eV.",2005-05-11T22:03:41Z
Formation and evolution of primordial black holes after hybrid inflation,"We examine the formation and evolution of primordial black holes (PBH's)
after hybrid inflation. Our goal is to assess the effects of various
theoretical uncertainties on the extrapolation from a given inflation model to
a spectrum of primordial black hole masses. The context of our work is an
examination of the possibility [Chen and Adler (2003), MacGibbon (1987)] that
the dark matter is comprised of Planck-mass black hole remnants (BHR's). As an
example we focus on a particular scenario [Chen (2003)] in which the black
holes form from quantum perturbations that were generated during hybrid
inflation. We find the correspondence between hybrid inflation parameters and
the range of initial PBH masses that would allow BHR's to comprise the dark
matter, taking account of the possible early presence of radiation and its
accretion onto the PBH's.",2005-04-27T18:27:27Z
"An Investigation of Diffuse Interstellar Gas toward a Large, Low
  Extinction Window into the Inner Galaxy","Halpha and Hbeta spectroscopy with the Wisconsin H-Alpha Mapper (WHAM)
reveals a strong concentration of high velocity emission in a ~ 5 by 5 deg area
centered near (l.b) = (27,-3), known as the Scutum Cloud. The high velocities
imply that we are detecting optical emission from near the plane of the Galaxy
out to the tangent point at heliocentric distances of D \gtrsim 6 kpc, assuming
the gas participates in circular Galactic rotation. The ratio of the Halpha to
Hbeta emission as a function of velocity suggests that dust along these lines
of sight produces a total visual extinction of A_v ~ 3 at D ~ 6 kpc. This makes
it possible to use optical emission lines to explore the physical conditions of
ionized gas in the inner Galaxy. At a Galactocentric distance R_G ~ 4 kpc, for
example, we find that the H^+ has an rms midplane density of ~ 1 cm^-3 with a
vertical scale height of ~ 300 pc. We also find evidence for an increase in the
flux of Lyman continuum photons and an increase in the ratio of ionized to
neutral hydrogen toward the inner Galaxy. We have extended the measurements of
E(B-V) in this direction to distances far beyond what has been accessible
through stellar photometry and find E(B-V)/N_H to be near the local mean of 1.7
x 10^-22 cm^2 mag, with evidence for an increase in this ratio at R_G ~ 4 kpc.
Finally, our observations of [NII] 6583, [SII] 6716, and [OIII] 5007 toward the
window reveal that in the inner Galaxy the temperature of the gas and the
ionization state of oxygen increase with increasing height from the midplane.",2005-05-24T05:50:47Z
AGN-driven convection in galaxy-cluster plasmas,"This paper describes how active galactic nuclei can heat galaxy-cluster
plasmas by driving convection in the intracluster medium. A model is proposed
in which a central supermassive black hole accretes intracluster plasma at the
Bondi rate and powers a radio source. The central radio source produces cosmic
rays, which mix into the thermal plasma. The cosmic-ray luminosity is
proportional to the mass accretion rate. The cosmic-ray pressure gradient
drives convection, which causes plasma heating. It is assumed that plasma
heating balances radiative cooling. The plasma heating rate is self-regulating
because the Bondi accretion rate is a decreasing function of the specific
entropy near the cluster center; if heating exceeds cooling, then the central
entropy increases, the Bondi rate and cosmic-ray luminosity decrease, and the
convective heating rate is reduced. This paper focuses on the role of
intracluster magnetic fields, which affect convection by causing heat and
cosmic rays to diffuse primarily along magnetic field lines. A new stability
criterion is derived for convection in a thermal-plasma/cosmic-ray fluid, and
equations for the average fluid properties in a convective cluster are obtained
with the use of a nonlocal two-fluid mixing length theory. Numerical solutions
of the model equations compare reasonably well with observations without
requiring fine tuning of the model parameters.",2005-06-04T18:39:29Z
Why Optically--Faint AGN Are Faint: The Spitzer Perspective,"Optically--faint X-ray sources (those with f_X/f_R > 10) constitute about 20%
of X-ray sources in deep surveys, and are potentially highly obscured and/or at
high redshift. Their faint optical fluxes are generally beyond the reach of
spectroscopy. For a sample of 20 optically--faint sources in CDFS, we compile
0.4--24 um photometry, relying heavily on Spitzer. We estimate photometric
redshifts for 17 of these 20 sources. We find that these AGN are
optically--faint both because they lie at significantly higher redshifts
(median z ~ 1.6) than most X-ray--selected AGN, and because their spectra are
much redder than standard AGN. They have 2--8 keV X-ray luminosities in the
Seyfert range, unlike the QSO--luminosities of optically--faint AGN found in
shallow, wide--field surveys. Their contribution to the X-ray Seyfert
luminosity function is comparable to that of z>1 optically--bright AGN.",2005-03-24T00:17:33Z
High-energetic Cosmic Antiprotons from Kaluza-Klein Dark Matter,"The lightest Kaluza-Klein particle (LKP) in models with universal extra
dimensions is an interesting dark matter candidate that has recently received
great attention. Here, we investigate the antiproton flux from LKP
annihilations in the galactic halo. In our analysis we include different halo
density profiles and allow for part of the dark matter to be concentrated in
'clumps' rather than being distributed homogeneously. After re-analyzing the
observational bounds on the allowed amount of clumpiness, we find that LKP
annihilations may well give a significant contribution to the antiproton flux
at energies higher than about 10 GeV, while for energies above around 500 GeV
the conventional background is expected to dominate again. The shortly upcoming
PAMELA satellite will already be able to measure part of this high-energy
window, while planned experiments like AMS-02 will have access to the full
energy range of interest.",2005-06-09T22:05:01Z
"The Effective Temperature Scale of Galactic Red Supergiants: Cool, But
  Not As Cool As We Thought","We use moderate-resolution optical spectrophotometry and the new MARCS
stellar atmosphere models to determine the effective temperatures of 74
Galactic red supergiants. From these we find a new effective temperature scale
that is significantly warmer than those in the literature. We show that this
temperature scale, along with the newly derived bolometric corrections, gives
much better agreement between our red supergiants and stellar evolutionary
tracks. This agreement provides an independent verification of our new
temperature scale. The combination of effective temperature and bolometric
luminosities allows us to calculate stellar radii; the coolest and most
luminous stars have radii of roughly 1500 solar radii (7 AU), in excellent
accordance with the largest stellar radii predicted from current evolutionary
theory. We find that similar results are obtained for the effective
temperatures and bolometric luminosities using only the de-reddened V-K colors,
providing a powerful demonstration of the self-consistency of the MARCS models.",2005-04-15T02:25:47Z
"Subaru HDS Transmission Spectroscopy of the Transiting Extrasolar Planet
  HD 209458b","We have searched for absorption in several common atomic species due to the
atmosphere or exosphere of the transiting extrasolar planet HD 209458b, using
high precision optical spectra obtained with the Subaru High Dispersion
Spectrograph (HDS). Previously we reported an upper limit on H alpha absorption
of 0.1% (3 sigma) within a 5.1\AA band. Using the same procedure, we now report
upper limits on absorption due to the optical transitions of Na D, Li, H alpha,
H beta, H gamma, Fe, and Ca. The 3 sigma upper limit for each transition is
approximately 1% within a 0.3\AA band (the core of the line), and a few tenths
of a per cent within a 2\AA band (the full line width). The wide-band results
are close to the expected limit due to photon-counting (Poisson) statistics,
although in the narrow-band case we have encountered unexplained systematic
errors at a few times the Poisson level. These results are consistent with all
previously reported detections and upper limits, but are significantly more
sensitive.",2005-04-25T14:46:50Z
The Star Formation Rate-Density Relationship at Redshift Three,"We study the star formation rate (SFR) as a function of environment for UV
selected Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at redshift three. From deep UBVI KPNO
4-m/MOSAIC images, covering a total of 0.90 deg^2, we select 334 LBGs in slices
100 Mpc (co-moving) deep spanning the redshift range 2.9<z<3.4 based on
Bayesian photometric redshifts that include the I magnitude as a prior. The
slice width (100 Mpc) corresponds to the photometric redshift accuracy
(\Delta_z\sim 0.15).
  We used mock catalogs from the GIF2 cosmological simulations to show that
this redshift resolution is sufficient to statistically differentiate the high
density regions from the low density regions using $\Sigma_5$, the projected
density to the 5th nearest neighbor. These mock catalogs have a redshift depth
of 100 Mpc, similar to our slice width.
  The large area of the MOSAIC images, 40x40 Mpc (co-moving) per field, allows
us to measure the SFR from the dust-corrected UV continuum as a function of
$\Sigma_5$. In contrast to low-redshift galaxies, we find that the SFR (or UV
luminosity) of LBGs at z=3 shows no detectable dependence on environment over 2
orders of magnitude in density.
  To test the significance of our result, we use Monte Carlo simulations (from
the mock catalogs) and the same projected density estimators we applied to our
data. We find that we can reject the steep z=0 SFR-density at the 5-$\sigma$
level. We conclude that the SFR-density at z=3 must be at least 3.6 times
flatter than it is locally, i.e. the SFR of LBGs is significantly less
dependent on environment than the SFR of local star-forming galaxies. We find
that the rest-frame UV colors are also independent of environment.",2005-03-04T10:52:34Z
Fast outflow of neutral and ionized gas from the radio galaxy 3C 293,"We detect a fast outflow of neutral and ionized gas with velocities up to
about 1000 km/s from the central region of radio galaxy 3C 293. With optical
spectroscopy we locate the bulk of the ionized gas outflow at the position of a
bright radio hot-spot in the inner radio jet, about 1 kpc east of the nucleus.
Given the presence of large amounts of cold gas and the distorted morphology of
the radio jet in this region, we argue that the ISM is pushed out by a severe
interaction with the radio plasma. The similarity of the outflow of HI with the
ionized gas outflow that we see at the position of the radio hot-spot suggests
that despite the high energies involved in the jet-ISM interaction, part of the
gas stays, or becomes again, neutral. In this paper we also present the
detection of HI emission in three nearby companions of 3C 293.",2005-06-16T18:36:30Z
"Color--Magnitude Diagrams and Luminosity Functions down to the Hydrogen
  Burning Limit. III. A Preliminary HST Study of NGC6791","Using HST ACS/WFC images, we derive the color--magnitude diagram of the old,
metal-rich open cluster NGC 6791 to nearly 29th magnitude in V, which is the
neighborhood of the hydrogen-burning limit.Comparison with isochrones leads to
a discussion of the distance modulus, the reddening, and the age of the
cluster. By making a statistical correction for field stars we derive a
preliminary luminosity function, and a very tentative mass function. The white
dwarf sequence is clearly shown, and has been discussed in a separate paper.",2005-04-28T09:32:13Z
The dark halo of the main lens galaxy in QSO 0957+561,"We present an analysis of infrared/optical/ultraviolet spectra of the two
images of the first gravitationally lensed quasar Q0957+561A, B. The Hubble
Space Telescope observations of Q0957+561A and Q0957+561B are separated in time
by the known time delay in this system, so we can directly deduce the flux
ratios. These flux ratios of images lead to important information on the dark
halo of the main lens galaxy (a giant elliptical at redshift z = 0.36). Our
measurements for the continuum are in good agreement with extinction in the
elliptical galaxy and a small fraction of mass in collapsed objects (no need
for gravitational microlensing). From the continuum and emission line ratios,
we also show evidence in favour of the existence of a network of compact dusty
clouds.",2005-03-29T09:05:58Z
XMM-Newton EPIC background modeling for extended sources,"We use XMM-Newton blank-sky and closed-cover background data to explore the
background subtraction methods for large extended sources filling the EPIC
field of view, such as nearby galaxy clusters, for which local background
estimation is difficult. We find that to keep the 0.8-7.0 keV band background
modeling uncertainty tolerable, one has to use a much more restrictive filter
than that commonly applied. In particular, because flares have highly variable
spectra, not all of them are identified by filtering the E>10 keV light curve.
We tried using the outer part of the EPIC FOV for monitoring the background in
a softer band (1-5 keV). We find that one needs to discard the time periods
when either the hard-band or the soft-band rate exceeds the nominal value by
more than 20% in order to limit the 90% CL background uncertainty to between 5%
at E=4-7 keV and 20% at E=0.8-1 keV, for both MOS and PN. This compares to a
10-30% respective PN uncertainty when only the hard-band light curve is used
for filtering, and to a 15-45% PN uncertainty when applying the commonly used
2-3 sigma filtering method. We illustrate our method on a nearby cluster A1795.
The above background uncertainties convert into the systematic temperature
uncertainties between 1% at r=3-4 arcmin and 20--25% (~1 keV for A1795) at
r=10-15 arcmin. For comparison, the commonly applied 2-3 sigma clipping of the
hard-band light curve misses a significant amount of flares, rendering the
temperatures beyond r=10 arcmin unconstrained. Thus, the background
uncertainties do not prohibit the EPIC temperature profile analysis of
low-brightness regions, like outer regions of galaxy clusters, provided a
conservative flare filtering such as the double filtering method with 20%
limits is used.",2005-04-16T12:38:02Z
High Mass Triple Systems: The Classical Cepheid Y Car,"We have obtained an HST STIS ultraviolet high dispersion Echelle mode
spectrum the binary companion of the double mode classical Cepheid Y Car. The
velocity measured for the hot companion from this spectrum is very different
from reasonable predictions for binary motion, implying that the companion is
itself a short period binary. The measured velocity changed by 7 km/ s during
the 4 days between two segments of the observation confirming this
interpretation. We summarize ""binary"" Cepheids which are in fact members of
triple system and find at least 44% are triples. The summary of information on
Cepheids with orbits makes it likely that the fraction is under-estimated.",2005-04-07T00:33:23Z
"The efficiency of electron acceleration in collisionless shocks and GRB
  energetics","Afterglow observations are commonly used to determine the parameters of GRB
explosions, the energy E, surrounding density n, post-shock magnetic field
equipartition fraction \epsilon_B and electron equipartition fraction
\epsilon_e, under the frequently made assumption that the efficiency of
electron ""injection"" into relativistic shock acceleration is high, i.e. that
the fraction f of electrons which undergo acceleration is f~1. We show that the
value of f can not be determined by current observations, since currently
testable model predictions for a parameter choice
{E'=E/f,n'=n/f,\epsilon'_B=f\epsilon_B,\epsilon'_e=f\epsilon_e} are independent
of the value of f for m_e/m_p< f< 1. Current observations imply that the
efficiency f is similar for highly relativistic and for sub relativistic
shocks, and plausibly suggest that f~1, quite unlike the situation in the Crab
Nebula. However, values m_e/m_p< f<< 1 can not be ruled out, implying a factor
m_e/m_p uncertainty in determination of model parameters. We show that early,
<10 hr, radio afterglow observations, which will be far more accessible in the
SWIFT era, may provide constraints on f. Such observations will therefore
provide a powerful diagnostic of GRB explosions and of the physics of particle
acceleration in collisionless shocks.",2005-02-03T15:58:49Z
"Wave propagation in a weak gravitational field and the validity of the
  thin lens approximation","Wave effects can be important for the gravitational lensing of gravitational
waves. In such a case, wave optics must be used in stead of geometric optics.
We consider a plane wave entering a lens object and solve numerically the wave
equation for three lens models: the uniform density sphere, the singular
isothermal sphere, and the Hernquist model. By comparing our numerical
solutions with the analytical solutions under the thin lens approximation, we
evaluate the error of this approximation. The results show that the relative
error of the thin lens approximation is small if the geometrical thickness of
the lens is much smaller than the distance between the lens and the observer.",2005-05-02T13:31:01Z
"The Cross-Correlation between Galaxies and Groups: Probing the Galaxy
  Distribution in and around Dark Matter Haloes","We determine the cross-correlation function between galaxies and galaxy
groups, using both the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) and the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We study the cross-correlation as a function
of group mass, and as a function of the luminosity, stellar mass, colour,
spectral type and specific star formation rate of the galaxies. All these
cross-correlation functions show a clear transition from the `1-halo' to the
`2-halo' regimes on a scale comparable to the virial radius of the groups in
consideration. On scales larger than the virial radius, all cross-correlation
functions are roughly parallel, consistent with the linear bias model. In
particular, the large scale correlation amplitudes are higher for more massive
groups, and for brighter and redder galaxies. In the `1-halo' regime, the
cross-correlation function depends strongly on the definition of the group
center. We consider both a luminosity-weighted center (LWC) and a center
defined by the location of the brightest group galaxy (BGC). With the first
definition, the bright early-type galaxies in massive groups are found to be
more centrally concentrated than the fainter, late-type galaxies. Using the
BGC, and excluding the brightest galaxy from the cross correlation analysis, we
only find significant segregation in massive groups ($M \gta
10^{13}h^{-1}\msun$) for galaxies of different spectral types (or colours or
specific star formation rates). In haloes with masses $\la 10^{13}h^{-1}\msun$,
there is a significant deficit of bright satellite galaxies. Comparing the
results from the 2dFGRS with those obtained from realistic mock samples, we
find that the distribution of galaxies in groups is much less concentrated than
dark matter haloes predicted by the current $\Lambda$CDM model. (Abridged)",2005-04-21T17:03:26Z
"Probing the dark matter profile of hot clusters and the M-T relation
  with XMM-Newton","We present results based on XMM-Newton observations of a small sample of hot
galaxy clusters. Making a full use of XMM-Newton's spectro-imaging
capabilities, we have extracted the radial temperature profile and gas density
profile, and with this information, calculated the total mass profile of each
cluster (under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical
symmetry). Comparing the individual scaled total mass profiles, we have probed
the Universality of rich cluster mass profiles over a wide range of radii (from
0.01 to 0.7 the virial radius). We have also tested the shape of cluster mass
profiles by comparing with the predicted profiles from numerical simulations of
hierarchical structure formation. We also derived the local mass-temperature
(M-T) scaling relation over a range of temperature going from 4 to 9 keV, that
we compare with theoretical predictions.",2005-02-28T13:33:47Z
The impact of gas physics on strong cluster lensing,"Previous studies of strong gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters neglected
the potential impact of the intracluster gas. Here, we compare simulations of
strong cluster lensing including gas physics at increasing levels of
complexity, i.e. with adiabatic, cooling, star-forming, feedback-receiving, and
thermally conducting gas, and with different implementations of the artificial
viscosity in the SPH simulations. Each cluster was simulated starting from the
same initial conditions such as to allow directly comparing the simulated
clusters. We compare the clusters' shapes, dynamics and density profiles and
study their strong-lensing cross sections computed by means of ray-tracing
simulations. We find that the impact of adiabatic gas depends on the amount of
turbulence that builds up, which means that the artificial viscosity plays an
important role. With the common viscosity implementation, adiabatic gas has
little effect on strong cluster lensing, while lower viscosity allows stronger
turbulence, thus higher non-thermal pressure and a generally broader gas
distribution which tends to lower lensing cross sections. Conversely, cooling
and star formation steepen the core density profiles and can thus increase the
strong-lensing efficiency considerably.",2005-04-08T15:49:30Z
Soft gamma repeaters outside the Local group,"We propose that the best sites to search for SGRs outside the Local group are
galaxies with active massive star formation. Different possibilities to observe
SGR activity from these sites are discussed. In particular we searched for
giant flares from nearby galaxies ($\sim 2$ -- 4 Mpc) M82,
  M83, NGC 253, and NGC 4945 in the BATSE data. No candidates alike giant SGR
flares were found. The absence of such detections implies that the rate of
giant flares with energy release in the initial spike above $0.5 \cdot 10^{44}$
erg is less then 1/25 yr$^{-1}$ in our Galaxy. However, hyperflares similar to
the one of 27 December 2004 can be observed from larger distances.
Nevertheless, we do not see any significant excess of short GRBs from the Virgo
galaxy cluster and from galaxies Arp 299 and NGC 3256 with extremely high star
formation rate. This implies that the galactic rate of hyperflares with energy
release $\sim 10^{46}$ erg is less than $\sim 10^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. With this
constraint the fraction of possible extragalactic SGR hyperflares among BATSE
short GRBs should not exceed few percents. We present a list of short GRBs
coincident with galaxies mentioned above, and discuss the possibility that some
of them are SGR giant flares. We propose that the best target for observations
of extragalactic SGR flares by {\it Swift} is the Virgo cluster.",2005-03-24T13:08:11Z
On the variation of the fine-structure constant in Friedmann Universes,"The fine-structure constant alpha does not vary as Friedmann Universes
evolve, a conclusion based on assessments of quantum mechanics and
electrodynamics. alpha = e^2/(4pi epsilon hbar c), where e is the charge of the
electron, epsilon is vacuum permittivity, c is the speed of light, and hbar is
Planck's constant divided by 2pi. This inquiry was motivated by Schrodinger's
(1939) prediction that all quantum wave functions coevolve with Friedmann
geometry and a similar prediction by Sumner (1994) for vacuum permittivity. The
functional form of variations in quantum wave functions found by Schrodinger is
enough to show that alpha does not vary. Electrodynamics also predicts that
alpha does not vary. Evolutionary changes in c exactly cancel those in vacuum
permittivity and other factors in alpha do not change. Since alpha appears in
all first-order perturbation formulas for atomic energy levels, comparisons of
the atomic spectra of distant atoms with those in laboratories provide an
experimental measure of this prediction. Most experiments find changes in alpha
that are either statistically zero or very small. These results and estimates
of the Hubble constant and deceleration parameter from precision
redshift/magnitude data support a major assumption of this paper that the
Friedmann solution to Einstein's theory of general relativity without
cosmological constant is an adequate approximation to spacetime geometry and
its long term evolution at quantum scales.",2005-03-07T23:03:32Z
Infrared Imaging of Capella with the IOTA Closure Phase Interferometer,"We present infrared aperture synthesis maps produced with the upgraded IOTA
interferometer. Michelson interferograms on the close binary system Capella
(Alpha Aur) were obtained in the H-band between 2002 November 12 and 16 using
the IONIC3 beam combiner. With baselines of 15m < B < 38m, we were able to
determine the relative position of the binary components with milliarcsecond
(mas) precision and to track their movement along the approx. 14 degree arc
covered by our observation run. We briefly describe the algorithms used for
visibility and closure phase estimation. Three different Hybrid Mapping and
Bispectrum Fitting techniques were implemented within one software framework
and used to reconstruct the source brightness distribution. By dividing our
data into subsets, the system could be mapped at three epochs, revealing the
motion of the stars. The precise position of the binary components was also
determined with model fits, which in addition revealed I_Aa/I_Ab=1.49 +/- 0.10
and apparent stellar uniform-disk (UD) diameters of Theta_Aa=8.9 +/- 0.6 mas
and Theta_Ab=5.8 +/- 0.8 mas.
  To improve the u, v-plane coverage, we compensated this orbital motion by
applying a rotation-compensating coordinate transformation. The resulting
model-independent map with a beam size of 5.4 x 2.6 mas allows the resolution
of the stellar surfaces of the Capella giants themselves.",2005-04-21T19:06:38Z
The axis of evil,"We examine previous claims for a preferred axis at $(b,l)\approx (60,-100)$
in the cosmic radiation anisotropy, by generalizing the concept of multipole
planarity to any shape preference (a concept we define mathematically).
Contrary to earlier claims, we find that the amount of power concentrated in
planar modes for $\ell=2,3$ is not inconsistent with isotropy and Gaussianity.
The multipoles' alignment, however, is indeed anomalous, and extends up to
$\ell=5$ rejecting statistical isotropy with a probability in excess of 99.9%.
There is also an uncanny correlation of azimuthal phases between $\ell=3$ and
$\ell=5$. We are unable to blame these effects on foreground contamination or
large-scale systematic errors. We show how this reappraisal may be crucial in
identifying the theoretical model behind the anomaly.",2005-02-11T12:10:56Z
"Dynamical quintessence fields Press-Schechter mass function:
  detectability and effect on dark haloes","We present an investigations on the influence of dynamical quintessence field
models on the formation of non-linear structures. In particular, we focus on
the structure traced by the mass function. Our contribution builds on previous
studies by considering two potentials not treated previousy and investigating
the impact of the free parameters of two other models. Our approach emphasises
the physical insight into the key role of the evolution of the equation of
state. We use the variations in the spherical non-linear collapse caused by
quintessence as a function of the model's potential in a Press Schechter scheme
to obtain the differences in halo mass functions. The comparison is also done
with the more usual scenario $\Lambda$CDM. We conclude the method should be
promissing for discrimination using cluster mass determination and that the key
role lies within the evolution of the equation of state.",2005-06-09T12:51:13Z
"Remarks on the formulation of the cosmological constant/dark energy
  problems","Associated with the cosmic acceleration are the old and new cosmological
constant problems, recently put into the more general context of the dark
energy problem. In broad terms, the old problem is related to an unexpected
order of magnitude of this component while the new problem is related to this
magnitude being of the same order of the matter energy density during the
present epoch of cosmic evolution. Current plans to measure the equation of
state certainly constitute an important approach; however, as we discuss, this
approach is faced with serious feasibility challenges and is limited in the
type of conclusive answers it could provide. Therefore, is it really too early
to seek actively for new tests and approaches to these problems? In view of the
difficulty of this endeavor, we argue here that a good place to start is by
questioning some of the assumptions underlying the formulation of these
problems and finding new ways to put this questioning to the test. First, we
calculate how much fine tuning the cosmic coincidence problem represents. Next,
we discuss the potential of some cosmological probes such as gravitational
lensing to identify novel tests to probe dark energy questions and assumptions.
Then, motivated by some theorems in General Relativity, we discuss if the full
identification of the cosmological constant with vacuum energy is
unquestionable. Also, we point out the relevance of experiments at the
interface of astrophysics and quantum field theory, such as the Casimir effect
in gravitational and cosmological contexts. We conclude that challenging some
of the assumptions underlying the cosmological constant problems and putting
them to the test may prove useful and necessary to make progress on these
questions. (Abridged)",2005-04-19T15:44:05Z
The Shape-Alignment relation in $Λ$CDM Cosmic Structures,"In this paper we study the supercluster - cluster morphological properties
using one of the largest ($2\times 512^{3}$ SPH+N-body simulations of large
scale structure formation in a $\Lambda$CDM model, based on the publicly
available code GADGET. We find that filamentary (prolate-like) shapes are the
dominant supercluster and cluster dark matter halo morphological feature, in
agreement with previous studies. However, the baryonic gas component of the
clusters is predominantly spherical. We investigate the alignment between
cluster halos (using either their DM or baryonic components) and their parent
supercluster major-axis orientation, finding that clusters show such a
preferential alignment. Combining the shape and the alignment statistics, we
also find that the amplitude of supercluster - cluster alignment increases
although weakly with supercluster filamentariness.",2005-05-31T11:44:03Z
"Absorption of dark matter by a supermassive black hole at the Galactic
  center: role of boundary conditions","The evolution of the dark matter distribution at the Galactic center is
analyzed, which is caused by the combination of gravitational scattering on
Galactic bulge stars and absorption by a supermassive black hole at the center
of the bulge. Attention is focused on the boundary condition on the black hole.
It is shown that its form depends on the energy of dark matter particles. The
modified flux of dark matter particles onto the black hole is calculated.
Estimates of the amount of dark matter absorbed show that the fraction of dark
matter in the total mass of the black hole may be significant. The density of
dark matter at the central part of the bulge is calculated. It is shown that
recently observed gamma radiation from the Galactic center can be attributed to
the annihilation of dark matter with this density.",2005-03-31T20:23:26Z
"The Influence of the Magnetic Field on the Properties of Neutron Star
  Matter","In the mean field approximation of the relativistic $\sigma$-$\omega$-$\rho$
model, the magnetic fields are incorporated, and its influence on the
properties of n-p-e neutron star matter are studied. When the strength of the
magnetic field is weaker than $\sim 10^{18}$G, the particle fractions and
chemical potentials, matter energy density and pressure hardly change with the
magnetic field; when the strength of the magnetic field is stronger than $\sim
10^{20}$G, the above quantities change with the magnetic field evidently.
Furthermore, the pressure is studied in both thermodynamics and hydrodynamics.
The difference between these two ways exits in the high density region, that
is, the thermal self-consistency may not be satisfied in this region if the
magnetic field is considered.",2005-05-06T04:42:39Z
"Cosmology from decaying dark energy, primordial at the Planck scale","The consideration of dark energy's quanta, required also by thermodynamics,
introduces its chemical potential into the cosmological equations. Isolating
its main contribution, we obtain solutions with dark energy decaying to matter
or radiation. When dominant, their energy densities tend asymptotically to a
constant ratio, explaining today's dark energy-dark matter coincidence, and in
agreement with supernova redshift data, and a universe-age constraint. This
also connects the Planck's and today's scales through time. This decay may be
manifested in the highest-energy cosmic rays, recently detected.",2005-02-22T03:22:10Z
"Constraining dark energy with cross-correlated CMB and Large Scale
  Structure data","We investigate the possibility of constraining dark energy with the
Integrated Sachs Wolfe effect recently detected by cross-correlating the WMAP
maps with several Large Scale Structure surveys. In agreement with previous
works, we found that, under the assumption of a flat universe, the ISW signal
is a promising tool for constraining dark energy. Current available data put
weak limits on a constant dark energy equation of state w. We also find no
constraints on the dark energy sound speed c_e^2. For quintessence-like dark
energy (c_e^2=1) we find w<-0.53, while tighter bounds are possible only if the
dark energy is ``clustered'' (c_e^2=0), in such a case -1.94<w<-0.63 at
2-sigma. Better measurements of the CMB-LSS correlation will be possible with
the next generation of deep redshift surveys. This will provide independent
constraints on the dark energy which are alternative to those usually inferred
from CMB and SN-Ia data.",2005-04-05T16:44:23Z
Relativistic jet motion in the core of the radio-loud quasar J1101+7225,"Multi-epoch GHz Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) data of the
radio-loud quasar J1101+7225 were analyzed to estimate the proper motion of
extended optically thin jet components. Two components separated from the core
could be mapped at 1.66 GHz, which is consistent with earlier observations. In
one case we found evidence of high apparent superluminal motion (beta_app=
22.5+/-4) at large (deprojected) distances to the core (22 mas ~ 4 kpc at z=
1.46). Typically in other quasars such high separation velocities are only
found much closer to the core component. Furthermore the Doppler factor, the
magnetic field strength, and the angular size of the optically thick core were
derived using published X-ray data. Analysis of 5 GHz VLBI data reveals the
existence of further jet components within the central 5 mas. Additionally the
data published so far on the GHz-spectrum were discussed at all angular
resolutions. J1101+7225 turns out to be a standard quasar for studying
different aspects of radio jet kinematics out to kpc-scales.",2005-04-25T18:37:57Z
An Analysis of Optical Pick-up in SCUBA Data,"The Sub-millimetre Common User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) at the JCMT employs a
chopping and nodding observation technique to remove variations in the
atmospheric signal and improve the long term stability of the instrument. In
order to understand systematic effects in SCUBA data, we have analysed
single-nod time streams from across SCUBA's lifetime, and present an analysis
of an ubiquitous optical pick-up signal connected to the pointing of the
secondary mirror. This pick-up is usually removed to a high level by
subtracting data from two nod positions and is therefore not obviously present
in most reduced SCUBA data. However, if the nod cancellation is not perfect
this pick-up can swamp astronomical signals. We discuss various methods which
have been suggested to account for this type of imperfect cancellation, and
also examine the impact of this pick-up on observations with future bolometric
cameras at the JCMT.",2005-02-21T15:15:42Z
"Optical and X-ray studies of chromospherically active stars : FR Cancri,
  HD 95559 and LO Pegasi","We present a multiwavelength study of three chromospherically active stars,
namely FR Cnc (= BD +16\degr 1753), HD 95559 and LO Peg (=BD +22\degr 4409),
including newly obtained optical photometry, low-resolution optical
spectroscopy for FR Cnc, as well as archival IR and X-ray observations. The BVR
photometry carried out during the years 2001 - 2004 has found significant
photometric variability to be present in all three stars. For FR Cnc, a
photometric period $0.8267 \pm 0.0004 \rm {d}$ has been established. The strong
variation in the phase and amplitude of the FR Cnc light curves when folded on
this period implies the presence of evolving and migrating spots or i spot
groups on its surface. Two independent spots with migration periods of 0.97 and
0.93 years respectively are inferred. The photometry of HD 95559 suggests the
formation of a spot (group) during the interval of our observations. We infer
the existence of two independent spots or groups in the photosphere of LO Peg,
one of which has a migration period of 1.12 years. The optical spectroscopy of
FR Cnc carried out during 2002-2003, reveals the presence of strong and
variable Ca II H and K, H$_\beta$ and $H_{\alpha}$ emission features indicative
of high level of chromospheric activity. The value of 5.3 for the ratio of the
excess emission in $H_{\alpha}$ to $H_{\beta}$, $E_{H_{\alpha}}/E_{H_{\beta}}$,
suggests that the chromospheric emission may arise from an extended off-limb
region. We have also analyzed archival X-ray observations of HD 95559 and LO
Peg carried out by with the ROSAT observatory. The best fit models to their
X-ray spectra imply the presence of two coronal plasma components of differing
temperatures and with sub-solar metal abundances.",2005-06-01T08:36:56Z
Introduction to Higher Order Spatial Statistics in Cosmology,"In this lecture notes I concentrate on the classic and widely applicable

A powerful bursting radio source towards the Galactic Centre,"Transient astronomical sources are typically powered by compact objects and
usually signify highly explosive or dynamic events. While radio astronomy has
an impressive record of obtaining high time resolution observations, usually it
is achieved in quite narrow fields-of-view. Consequently, the dynamic radio sky
is poorly sampled, in contrast to the situation in the X- and gamma-ray bands
in which wide-field instruments routinely detect transient sources. Here we
report a new transient source, GCRT J1745-3009, detected in 2002 during a
moderately wide-field radio transient monitoring program of the Galactic center
(GC) region at 0.33 GHz. The characteristics of its bursts are unlike those
known for any other class of radio transient. If located in or near the GC, its
brightness temperature (~10^16 K) and the implied energy density within GCRT
J1745-3009 vastly exceeds that observed in most other classes of radio
astronomical sources, and is consistent with coherent emission processes rarely
observed. We conclude that GCRT J1745-3009 is the first member of a new class
of radio transient sources, the first of possibly many new classes to be
identified through current and upcoming radio surveys.",2005-03-02T20:42:45Z
"Post-glitch variability in the Anomalous X-ray Pulsar 1RXS
  J170849.0-400910","We report on the first XMM-Newton observation of the Anomalous X-ray Pulsar
1RXS J170849.0-400910. The source was observed in 2003 August and was found at
a flux level a factor of about two lower than previous observations. Moreover,
a significant spectral evolution appears to be present, the source exhibiting a
much softer spectrum than in the past. Comparison of the present properties of
1RXS J170849.0-400910 with those from archival data shows a clear correlation
between the X-ray flux and the spectral hardness. In particular, the flux and
the spectral hardness reached a maximum level close to the two glitches the
source experienced in 1999 and in 2001, and successively decreased. Although
the excellent XMM-Newton spectral resolution should in principle allow us to
detect the absorption line reported in a phase-resolved spectrum with BeppoSAX
and interpreted as a cyclotron feature, we found no absorption features,
neither in the phase averaged spectrum nor in the phase resolved spectra. We
discuss in detail both the possibilities that the feature in the BeppoSAX data
may have resulted from a spurious detection or that it is real and
intrinsically variable. We then discuss a possible explanation for the glitches
and for the softening of the source emission which followed the flux decrease,
in the framework of the magnetar model.",2005-05-19T12:06:37Z
"Temperature fluctuations in HII regions: ionization by Cosmic Rays as a
  key mechanism","We present a detailed model capable of explaining quantitatively the
temperature fluctuations observed in luminous, large HII regions. The model is
based on two assumptions which we justify on the basis of observations: that
the major fraction of the hydrogen in the clouds that form the HII regions is
not photoionized and is essentially HI, this HII is lightly ionized by fluxes
of low energy cosmic rays (CR) produced by processes originating in the hot
stars which illuminate the regions.",2005-05-18T12:19:34Z
Hot Neutron and Quark Star Evolution,"The physics of compact objects is one of the very actively developing
branches of theoretical investigations, since the careful analysis of different
models for the internal structure of these objects, their evolutionary
characteristics and the comparison with modern observational data give access
to discriminate among various speculations about the state of matter under
extreme conditions.
  The lecture provides an overview to the problem of neutron star cooling
evolution. We discuss the scheme and necessary inputs for neutron star cooling
simulations from the background of a microscopic modeling in order to present
the surface temperature - age characteristics of hybrid neutron stars including
the determination of main regulators of the cooling process, the question of
neutrino production and diffusion.",2005-06-16T23:19:01Z
"Feedback and Brightest Cluster Galaxy Formation: ACS Observations of the
  Radio Galaxy TN J1338--1942 at z=4.1","We present deep optical imaging of the z=4.1 radio galaxy TN J1338--1942
obtained using the ACS on-board HST. The radio galaxy is known to reside within
a large galaxy overdensity (both in physical extent and density contrast).
There is good evidence that this `protocluster' region is the progenitor of a
present-day rich galaxy cluster. TN J1338 is the dominant galaxy in the
protocluster, in terms of size and luminosity and therefore seems destined to
evolve into the brightest cluster galaxy. The high spatial-resolution ACS
images reveal several kpc-scale features within and around the radio galaxy.
The continuum light is aligned with the radio axis and is resolved into two
clumps in the i-band and z-band bands. These components have luminosities ~10^9
L_sun and sizes of a few kpc. The estimated star-formation rate for the whole
radio galaxy is ~200 M_sun/yr. A simple model in which the jet has triggered
star-formation in these continuum knots is consistent with the available data.
An unusual feature is seen in Lyman-alpha emission. A wedge-shaped extension
emanates from the radio galaxy perpendicularly to the radio axis. This `wedge'
naturally connects to the surrounding, asymmetric, large-scale (~100 kpc)
Lyman-alpha halo. We posit that the wedge is a starburst-driven superwind,
associated with the first major epoch of formation of the brightest cluster
galaxy. The shock and wedge are examples of feedback processes due to both AGN
and star-formation in the earliest stages of massive galaxy formation.",2005-05-30T20:06:23Z
Evolutionary Signatures in the Formation of Low-Mass Protostars,"We present an evolutionary picture of a forming star. We assume a singular,
isothermal sphere as the initial state of the core that undergoes collapse as
described by \citet{shu77}. We include the evolution of a first hydrostatic
core at early times and allow a disk to grow as predicted by \citet{adams86}.
We use a 1-dimensional radiative transfer code to calculate the spectral energy
distribution for the evolving protostar from the beginning of collapse to the
point when all envelope material has accreted onto the star+disk system. Then,
we calculate various observational signatures ($T_{bol}$, $L_{bol}/L_{smm}$,
and infrared colors) as a function of time.
  As defined by the bolometric temperature criterion, the Class 0 stage should
be very short, while the Class I stage persists for much of the protostar's
early life. We present physical distinctions among the classes of forming stars
and calculate the observational signatures for these classes. Finally, we
present models of infrared color-magnitude diagrams, as observed by the Spitzer
Space Telescope, that should be strong discriminators in determining the stage
of evolution for a protostar.",2005-03-21T21:11:53Z
"On the temperature profile of radiatively efficient geometrically thin
  disks in black hole binaries with the ASCA GIS","X-ray spectra of black hole binaries(BHBs) in the high/soft state were
studied comprehensively by using ASCA GIS data, and partially RXTE PCA data. A
mathematical disk model was applied to several BHBs to see if the observed
accretion disk temperature profile was consistent with that expected from the
standard accretion disk model. This model is called p-free disk, and assumes
that the spectrum is composed of multi-temperature blackbody emission of which
the local temperature T(r) at radius r is given by T(r) ~ r^-p with p being a
positive free parameter. The standard disk roughly requires p~3/4, while a
small deviation is expected depending on the inner boundary conditions, general
relativistic effects and disk vertical structures.Our sample objects included
LMC X-1, LMC X-3, XTE J2012+381, and GRO J1655-40. During the ASCA
observations, these BHBs showed characteristics of the standard high/soft
state. Under the standard modeling of high-state black hole binaries, the
sources show Tin=0.76-1.17keV, the disk fraction to the total 0.7-10keV flux of
54-98%, and Nh=(0.7--12)E21/cm^2. The best-fit p-values were found in 0.6-0.8,
and the standard value of p=3/4 was accepted for all the sources.The obtained
p-values are also compared with those expected for the standard accretion disk
in the Schwarzschild metric, and they were consistent with those expected from
the standard accretion disk.",2005-05-17T02:47:48Z
"Distance determinations using type II supernovae and the expanding
  photosphere method","Due to their high intrinsic brightness, type II supernovae (SN) can be used
as lighthouses to constrain distances in the Universe using variants of the
Baade-Wesselink method. Based on a large set of CMFGEN models (Hillier & Miller
1998) covering the photospheric phase of type II SN, we study the various
concepts entering one such technique, the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM).
We compute correction factors $\xi$ needed to approximate the synthetic
Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) with that of a blackbody at temperature $T$.
Our $\xi$, although similar, are systematically greater, by $\sim 0.1$, than
the values obtained by Eastman et al. (1996). This translate into a systematic
enhancement of 10-20% in EPM-distances. We find that line emission and
absorption, not directly linked to color temperature variations, can
considerably alter the synthetic magnitude, and cause above-unity $\xi$-values.
Optically-thick lines, present in the optical at late-times, can also introduce
a strong wavelength-dependence of the photospheric radius, invalidating the use
of the Baade method. Both the impact of line-blanketing on the SED and the
photospheric radius at low $T$ suggest that the EPM is best used at early
times, when the outflow is fully ionized and line-opacity mostly confined to
the UV range. We also investigate how reliably one can measure the photospheric
velocity from P-Cygni line profiles. Contrary to the usually held belief, the
velocity at maximum absorption in the P-Cygni trough of optically-thick lines
can both {\it overestimate or underestimate} the photospheric velocity, with a
magnitude that depends on the SN outflow density gradient and the optical
thickness of the line.",2005-05-23T02:18:30Z
"R-Process Nucleosynthesis in MHD Jet Explosions of Core-Collapse
  Supernovae","We investigate $r$-process nucleosynthesis during the magnetohydrodynamical
(MHD) explosion of supernova in a massive star of 13 $M_{\odot}$. Contrary to
the case of the spherical explosion, jet-like explosion due to the combined
effects of the rotation and magnetic field lowers the electron fraction
significantly inside the layers above the iron core. We find that the ejected
material of low electron fraction responsible for the $r$-process comes out
from the silicon rich layer of the presupernova model. This leads to the
production up to the third peak in the solar $r$-process elements. We examine
whether the fission affects the $r$-process paths by using the full nuclear
reaction network with both the spontaneous and $\beta$-delayed fission
included. Moreover, we pay particular attention how the mass formula affects
the $r$-process peaks with use of two mass formulae. It is found that both
formulae can reproduce the global abundance pattern up to the third peak though
detailed distributions are rather different. We point out that there are
variations in the $r$-process nucleosynthesis if the MHD effects play an
important role in the supernova explosion.",2005-04-05T09:02:15Z
Evolution of non-linear cosmological perturbations,"We define fully non-perturbative generalizations of the uniform density and
comoving curvature perturbations, which are known, in the linear theory, to be
conserved on sufficiently large scales for adiabatic perturbations. Our
non-linear generalizations are defined geometrically, independently of any
coordinate system. We give the equations governing their evolution on all
scales. Also, in order to make contact with previous works on first and second
order perturbations, we introduce a coordinate system and show that previous
results can be recovered, on large scales, in a remarkably simple way, after
restricting our definitions to first and second orders in a perturbative
expansion.",2005-03-18T16:44:55Z
Present and Future Astrometric Study of Halo Substructure,"We focus on how astrometric surveys might be exploited for the study of
Galactic halo substructure originating from the disruption of satellite
systems. The Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal tidal stream provides a useful
template to explore present and future capabilities of proper motion surveys
for finding and studying substructure as well as for using individual tidal
streams to probe the global properties of the Milky Way. The configuration of
the Sgr stream is particularly well suited for measuring the flattening of the
halo and for providing an independent means for measuring the speed of the
Local Standard of Rest. For the various proposed experiments, the required
proper motion accuracies are well within the capabilities of the Space
Interferometry Mission (SIM PlanetQuest).",2005-03-31T19:19:54Z
"Considerations in optimizing CMB polarization experiments to constrain
  inflationary physics","We quantify the limiting factors in optimizing current-technology cosmic
microwave background (CMB) polarization experiments in order to learn about
inflationary physics. We consider space-based, balloon-borne and ground-based
experiments. We find that foreground contamination and residuals from
foreground subtraction are ultimately the limiting factors in detecting a
primordial gravity wave signal. For full-sky space-based experiments, these
factors hinder the detection of tensor-to-scalar ratios of r < 10^{-3} on large
scales, while for ground-based experiments these factors impede the ability to
apply delensing techniques. We consider ground-based/balloon-borne experiments
of currently planned or proposed designs and find that it is possible for a
value of r=0.01 to be measured at ~ 3-sigma level. A small space-based CMB
polarization experiment, with current detector technology and full sky
coverage, can detect r ~ 10^{-3} at the ~ 3-sigma level, but a markedly
improved knowledge of polarized foregrounds is needed. We advocate using as
wide a frequency coverage as possible in order to carry out foreground
subtraction at the percent level, which is necessary to measure such a small
primordial tensor amplitude. To produce a clearly detectable (>3-sigma) tensor
component in a realistic CMB experiment, inflation must either involve
large-field variations, \Delta\phi >~ 1 or multi-field/hybrid models. Hybrid
models can be easily distinguished from large-field models due to their blue
scalar spectral index. Therefore, an observation of a tensor/scalar ratio and n
< 1 in future experiments with the characteristics considered here may be an
indication that inflation is being driven by some physics in which the inflaton
cannot be described as a fundamental field.",2005-06-02T18:57:42Z
"On the detection of relativistic magnetic monopoles by deep underwater

The Radio Afterglow and Host Galaxy of the Dark GRB 020819,"Of the fourteen gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) localized to better than 2' radius
with the SXC on HETE-2, only two lack optical afterglow detections, and the
high recovery rate among this sample has been used to argue that the fraction
of truly dark bursts is ~10%. While a large fraction of earlier dark bursts can
be explained by the failure of ground-based searches to reach appropriate
limiting magnitudes, suppression of the optical light of these SXC dark bursts
seems likely. Here we report the discovery and observation of the radio
afterglow of GRB 020819, an SXC dark burst, which enables us to identify the
likely host galaxy (probability of 99.2%) and hence the redshift (z=0.41) of
the GRB. The radio light curve is qualitatively similar to that of several
other radio afterglows, and may include an early-time contribution from the
emission of the reverse shock. The proposed host is a bright R = 19.5 mag
barred spiral galaxy, with a faint R ~ 24.0 mag ""blob'' of emission, 3"" from
the galaxy core (16 kpc in projection), that is coincident with the radio
afterglow. Optical photometry of the galaxy and blob, beginning 3 hours after
the burst and extending over more than 100 days, establishes strong upper
limits to the optical brightness of any afterglow or associated supernova.
Combining the afterglow radio fluxes and our earliest R-band limit, we find
that the most likely afterglow model invokes a spherical expansion into a
constant-density (rather than stellar wind-like) external environment; within
the context of this model, a modest local extinction of A_V ~ 1 mag is
sufficient to suppress the optical flux below our limits.",2005-05-02T20:25:46Z
Ion Heating in Collisionless Shocks in Supernovae and the Heliosphere,"Collisionless shocks play a role in many astrophysical phenomena, from
coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in the heliosphere to supernova remnants. Their
role in heating and accelerating particles is well accepted yet the exact
mechanism for ion heating is not well understood. Two systems, CMEs and
supernova remnants, were examined to determine the heating of heavy ions as
they pass through collisionless shocks thus providing a seed population for
cosmic ray acceleration processes. Three parameters are examined, the plasma
beta, the Mach number of the shock and the magnetic angle of the shock. CMEs
heat heavy ions preferentially. This is in contrast to the supernova data which
shows less than mass proportional heating. In addition to these studies,
heating in astrophysical systems involves neutral atoms. A Monte Carlo model
simulated neutral particles as they pass through the shock. Neutrals can create
a precursor to the shock additionally heating the plasma. This work uses in
situ data from the heliosphere to study astronomical systems because of common
shock properties is a unique way to study magnetic components of shocks
remotely.",2005-06-14T21:13:20Z
Radio Recombination Lines from the Starburst Galaxy NGC 3256,"We have detected the radio recombination lines H91-alpha and H92-alpha with
rest frequencies of 8.6 GHz and 8.3 GHz from the starburst nucleus NGC 3256 at
an angular resolution of 16.4"" x 9.6"" using the Australia Telescope Compact
Array and at an angular resolution of 12.0"" x 2.9"" using the VLA. The line was
detected at ~ 1 mJy/beam peak with a width of 160 km/s with the ATCA and at ~
0.5 mJy/beam peak with a width of 114 km/s with the VLA. Modelling the line
emitting region as a collection of HII regions, we derive constraints on the
required number of HII regions, their temperature, density, and distribution.
We find that a collection of 10 to 300 HII regions with temperatures of 5000 K,
densities of 1000 cm^-3 to 5000 cm^-3 and diameters of 15 pc produced good
matches to the line and continuum emmission. The Lyman continuum production
rate required to maintain the ionization is 2 x 10^52 s^-1 to 6 x 10^53 s^-1,
which requires 600 to 17000 O5 stars to be produced in the starburst.",2005-02-22T11:20:23Z
"Fe XI emission lines in a high resolution extreme ultraviolet spectrum
  obtained by SERTS","New calculations of radiative rates and electron impact excitation cross
sections for Fe XI are used to derive emission line intensity ratios involving
3s^23p^4 - 3s^23p^33d transitions in the 180-223 A wavelength range. These
ratios are subsequently compared with observations of a solar active region,
obtained during the 1995 flight Solar EUV Research Telescope and Spectrograph
(SERTS). The version of SERTS flown in 1995 incorporated a multilayer grating
that enhanced the instrumental sensitivity for features in the 170 - 225 A
wavelength range, observed in second-order between 340 and 450 A. This
enhancement led to the detection of many emission lines not seen on previous
SERTS flights, which were measured with the highest spectral resolution (0.03
A) ever achieved for spatially resolved active region spectra in this
wavelength range. However, even at this high spectral resolution, several of
the Fe XI lines are found to be blended, although the sources of the blends are
identified in the majority of cases. The most useful Fe XI electron density
diagnostic line intensity ratio is I(184.80 A)/I(188.21 A). This ratio involves
lines close in wavelength and free from blends, and which varies by a factor of
11.7 between N_e = 10^9 and 10^11 cm^-3, yet shows little temperature
sensitivity. An unknown line in the SERTS spectrum at 189.00 A is found to be
due to Fe XI, the first time (to our knowledge) this feature has been
identified in the solar spectrum. Similarly, there are new identifications of
the Fe XI 192.88, 198.56 and 202.42 A features, although the latter two are
blended with S VIII/Fe XII and Fe XIII, respectively.",2005-04-05T11:57:55Z
The Variation of Integrated Star IMFs among Galaxies,"The integrated galaxial initial mass function (IGIMF) is the relevant
distribution function containing the information on the distribution of stellar
remnants, the number of supernovae and the chemical enrichment history of a
galaxy. Since most stars form in embedded star clusters with different masses
the IGIMF becomes an integral of the assumed (universal or invariant) stellar
IMF over the embedded star-cluster mass function (ECMF). For a range of
reasonable assumptions about the IMF and the ECMF we find the IGIMF to be
steeper (containing fewer massive stars per star) than the stellar IMF, but
below a few Msol it is invariant and identical to the stellar IMF for all
galaxies. However, the steepening sensitively depends on the form of the ECMF
in the low-mass regime. Furthermore, observations indicate a relation between
the star formation rate of a galaxy and the most massive young stellar cluster
in it. The assumption that this cluster mass marks the upper end of a
young-cluster mass function leads to a connection of the star formation rate
and the slope of the IGIMF above a few Msol. The IGIMF varies with the star
formation history of a galaxy. Notably, large variations of the IGIMF are
evident for dE, dIrr and LSB galaxies with a small to modest stellar mass. We
find that for any galaxy the number of supernovae per star (NSNS) is suppressed
relative to that expected for a Salpeter IMF. Dwarf galaxies have a smaller
NSNS compared to massive galaxies. For dwarf galaxies the NSNS varies
substantially depending on the galaxy assembly history and the assumptions made
about the low-mass end of the ECMF. The findings presented here may be of some
consequence for the cosmological evolution of the number of supernovae per
low-mass star and the chemical enrichment of galaxies of different mass.",2005-02-24T21:05:14Z
"One-Up On L1: Can X-rays Provide Longer Advanced Warning of Solar Wind
  Flux Enhancements Than Upstream Monitors?","Observations of strong solar wind proton flux correlations with ROSAT X-ray
rates along with high spectral resolution Chandra observations of X-rays from
the dark Moon show that soft X-ray emission mirrors the behavior of the solar
wind. In this paper, based on an analysis of an X-ray event observed by
XMM-Newton resulting from charge exchange of high charge state solar wind ions
and contemporaneous neutral solar wind data, we argue that X-ray observations
may be able to provide reliable advance warning, perhaps by as much as half a
day, of dramatic increases in solar wind flux at Earth. Like neutral atom
imaging, this provides the capability to monitor the solar wind remotely rather
than in-situ.",2005-02-17T00:17:31Z
"The complete set of ASCA X-ray observations of non-magnetic cataclysmic
  variables","We present the complete set of thirty four ASCA observations of non-magnetic
cataclysmic variables. Timing analysis reveals large X-ray flux variations in
dwarf novae in outburst (Z Cam, SS Cyg and SU UMa) and orbital modulation in
high inclination systems (including OY Car, HT Cas, U Gem, T Leo). We also
found episodes of unusually low accretion rate during quiescence (VW Hyi and SS
Cyg). Spectral analysis reveals broad temperature distributions in individual
systems, with emission weighted to lower temperatures in dwarf novae in
outburst. Absorption in excess of interstellar values is required in dwarf
novae in outburst, but not in quiescence. We also find evidence for sub-solar
abundances and X-ray reflection in the brightest systems. LS Peg, V426 Oph and
EI UMa have X-ray spectra that are distinct from the rest of the sample and all
three exhibit candidate X-ray periodicities. We argue that they should be
reclassified as intermediate polars. In the case of V345 Pav we found that the
X-ray source had been previously misidentified.",2005-02-16T14:57:11Z
Spherical Collapse Model And Dark Energy(II),"This is a second paper of a series of two. In this paper, we directly correct
the problem pointed out in the first paper of this series, dark energy does not
cluster on the scale of galaxy clusters, but the current describing the flowing
of dark energies outside the clusters is ignored in almost all the previous
papers. We set up and solve a first order differential equation which describes
the evolution of the clusters in a back ground universe containing dark
energies.
  From the solution we extract the key parameters of the model and find them
depending on the equation of state coefficients of dark energies rather
non-trivially. We then apply the results in Press-Scheter theory and calculate
the number density of galaxy clusters and its evolutions, we find the
observable quantities are strongly affected by the equation of state
coefficients of dark energies.",2005-05-09T13:51:59Z
Type Ia Supernovae: Simulations and Nucleosynthesis,"We present our first nucleosynthesis results from a numerical simulation of
the thermonuclear disruption of a static cold Chandrasekhar-mass C/O white
dwarf. The two-dimensional simulation was performed with an adaptive-mesh
Eulerian hydrodynamics code, FLASH, that uses as a flame capturing scheme the
evolution of a passive scaler. To compute the isotopic yields and their
velocity distribution, 10,000 massless tracer particles are embedded in the
star. The particles are advected along streamlines and provide a Lagrangian
description of the explosion. We briefly describe our verification tests and
preliminary results from post-processing the particle trajectories with a
modest (214 isotopes) reaction network.",2005-05-19T19:29:41Z
New constraints on SN Ia progenitor models,"We use the StarTrack population synthesis code to discuss potential
progenitor models of SN Ia: single degenerate scenario, semi-detached double
white dwarf binary and double degenerate scenario. Using the most recent
calculations of accretion onto white dwarfs, we consider SN Ia explosions of
various white dwarfs in binary systems. We calculate the evolutionary delay
times from the zero age main sequence to the explosion, and verify which
scenarios can satisfy the constraints found by Strolger et al. (2004), i.e. a
delay time of 2-4 Gyrs. It is found that the semi-detached double white dwarf
binary model is inconsistent with observations. Only SN Ia progenitors in the
double degenerate scenario are compatible with observations in all tested
evolutionary models, with a characteristic delay time of about 3 Gyrs. If
double degenerate mergers are excluded as SN Ia progenitors, we find that the
single degenerate scenario may explain the observed delay times for models with
low common envelope efficiency. It is also noted that the delay time
distributions within the various tested SN Ia scenarios vary significantly and
potentially can be used as an additional constraint on progenitor models.",2005-02-09T17:51:29Z
"The diffuse neutrino flux from FR-II radio galaxies and blazars: A
  source property based estimate","Water and ice Cherenkov telescopes of the present and future aim for the
detection of a neutrino signal from extraterrestrial sources at energies E>PeV.
Some of the most promising extragalactic sources are Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN). In this paper, the neutrino flux from two kinds of AGN sources will be
estimated assuming photohadronic interactions in the jet of the AGN. The first
analyzed sample contains FR-II radio galaxies while the second AGN type
examined are blazars. The result is highly dependent on the proton's index of
the energy spectrum. To normalize the spectrum, the connection between neutrino
and disk luminosity will be used by applying the jet-disk symbiosis model from
Falcke and Biermann (1995). The maximum proton energy and thus, also the
maximum neutrino energy of the source is connected to its disk luminosity,
which was shown by Lovelace (1976) and was confirmed by Falcke et al. (1995).",2005-02-04T09:54:09Z
"SN/GRB connection: a statistical approach with BATSE and Asiago
  Catalogues","Recent observations suggest that some types of GRB are physically connected
with SNe of type Ib/c. However, it has been pointed out by several authors that
some GRBs could be associated also with other types of core-collapse SNe (type
IIdw/IIn). On the basis of a comphrensive statistical study, which has made use
of the BATSE and Asiago catalogues, we have found that: i) the temporal and
spacial distribution of SNe-Ib/c is marginally correlated with that of the
BATSE GRBs; ii) we do not confirm the existence of an association between GRBs
and SNe-IIdw/IIn.",2005-05-03T11:39:15Z
"Equilibrium Disk-Bulge-Halo Models for the Milky Way and Andromeda
  Galaxies","We describe a new set of self-consistent, equilibrium disk galaxy models that
incorporate an exponential disk, a Hernquist model bulge, an NFW halo and a
central supermassive black hole. The models are derived from explicit
distribution functions for each component and the large number of parameters
permit detailed modeling of actual galaxies. We present techniques that use
structural and kinematic data such as radial surface brightness profiles,
rotation curves and bulge velocity dispersion profiles to find the best-fit
models for the Milky Way and M31. Through N-body realizations of these models
we explore their stability against the formation of bars. The models permit the
study of a wide range of dynamical phenomenon with a high degree of realism.",2005-06-08T19:04:32Z
A CO Survey of Young Planetary Nebulae,"We report the results of a sensitive survey of young planetary nebulae in the
CO J=2-1 line that significantly increases the available data on warm, dense,
molecular gas in the early phases of planetary nebula formation. The
observations were made using the IRAM 30 m telescope with the 3 by 3 pixel
Heterodyne Receiver Array (HERA). The array provides an effective means of
discriminating the CO emission of planetary nebulae in the galactic plane from
contaminating emission of interstellar clouds along the line of sight. 110
planetary nebulae were observed in the survey and 40 were detected. The results
increase the number of young planetary nebulae with known CO emission by
approximately a factor of two. The CO spectra yield radial velocities for the
detected nebulae, about half of which have uncertain or no velocity
measurements at optical wavelengths. The CO profiles range from parabolic to
double-peaked, tracing the evolution of structure in the molecular gas. The
line widths are significantly larger than on the Asymptotic Giant Branch, and
many of the lines show extended wings, which probably result from the effects
on the envelopes of high velocity jets.",2005-06-03T22:31:21Z
"Application of an Equilibrium Vaporization Model to the Ablation of
  Chondritic and Achondritic Meteoroids","We modeled equilibrium vaporization of chondritic and achondritic materials

meteors. Our results are qualitatively consistent with observations of meteor
spectra.",2005-06-01T20:33:26Z
Stellar and total mass in early-type lensing galaxies,"For 18 well-observed gravitationally lensed QSOs, we compare new
non-parametric mass profiles for the lensing galaxies with stellar-population
models derived from published HST photometry. The large volume of parameter
space searched -- with respect to the possible star formation histories --
allows us to infer robust estimates and uncertainties for the stellar masses.
The most interesting results are: (1) the transition from little or no dark
matter in the inner regions (<r_e) to dark matter dominating on the ~5r_e scale
(~20 kpc) is clearly seen in massive ellipticals; (2) Such a trend is not seen
in lower-mass galaxies, so that the stellar content dominates the mass budget
out to ~5r_e; (3) the radial gradient in the dark-matter fraction for these
intermediate redshift galaxies agrees with published data on nearby galaxies.
This result can help reconcile the discrepancies found in recent estimates of
dark matter in elliptical galaxies using different techniques (e.g. Planetary
nebulae versus X-ray). The observed trend suggests the stellar component in
massive galaxies extends further out in terms of the dark matter scale radius.",2005-03-07T22:42:55Z
The Distribution of Bar and Spiral Strengths in Disk Galaxies,"The distribution of bar strengths in disk galaxies is a fundamental property
of the galaxy population that has only begun to be explored. We have applied
the bar/spiral separation method of Buta, Block, and Knapen to derive the
distribution of maximum relative gravitational bar torques, Q_b, for 147 spiral
galaxies in the statistically well-defined Ohio State University Bright Galaxy
Survey (OSUBGS) sample. Our goal is to examine the properties of bars as
independently as possible of their associated spirals. We find that the
distribution of bar strength declines smoothly with increasing Q_b, with more
than 40% of the sample having Q_b <= 0.1. In the context of recurrent bar
formation, this suggests that strongly-barred states are relatively short-lived
compared to weakly-barred or non-barred states. We do not find compelling
evidence for a bimodal distribution of bar strengths. Instead, the distribution
is fairly smooth in the range 0.0 <= Q_b < 0.8. Our analysis also provides a
first look at spiral strengths Q_s in the OSU sample, based on the same torque
indicator. We are able to verify a possible weak correlation between Q_s and
Q_b, in the sense that galaxies with the strongest bars tend also to have
strong spirals.",2005-05-04T17:13:20Z
Can AB Dor C be a Tight Binary Brown Dwarf?,"AB Dor C, a low-mass companion to the young star AB Dor A has recently been
imaged. Direct detection and astrometric observations have been used to solve
the AB Dor C orbit and obtain a dynamical mass estimate. Near-infrared
magnitudes and effective temperatures from models have then been compared with
observed values. Models and observations disagree at more than the 2 sigma
level. This result prompts Close et al. 2005 to claim that models are
overestimating young low-mass object luminosities by roughly a factor of two.
This claim is based on the hypothesis that the detected source, AB Dor C, is a
single object. Another possible interpretation of the data that was not
considered is that AB Dor C is an unresolved binary brown dwarf. Considering
that 21 brown dwarfs companions have been found to date around stars and that
three of them are confirmed or potential brown dwarf binaries (Gl569Ba & Bb,
GL564B & C and Indi Ba & Bb), this suggests that brown dwarf binaries may
constitute a significant fraction (14% +/- 8%) of the brown dwarf population
around stars. For these reasons, the possibility that AB Dor C is an unresolved
binary brown dwarf deserves attention.",2005-02-18T19:24:51Z
Absence of linear polarization in Halpha emission of solar flares,"High sensitivity observations of Halpha polarization of 30 flares of
different sizes and disk positions are reported. Both filter and spectrographic
techniques have been used. The ZIMPOL system eliminates spurious polarizations
due to seeing and flat-field effects. We didn't find any clear linear
polarization signature above our sensitivity level which was usually better
than 0.1%. The observations include an X17.1 flare with gamma-ray lines
reported by the RHESSI satellite. These results cast serious doubts on previous
claims of linear polarization at the one percent level and more, attributed to
impact polarization. The absence of linear polarization limits the anisotropy
of energetic protons in the H$\alpha$ emitting region. The likely causes are
isotropization by collisions with neutrals in the chromosphere and defocusing
by the converging magnetic field.",2005-02-14T13:49:29Z
"General Astrophysics and Comparative Planetology with the Terrestrial
  Planet Finder Missions","The two Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) missions aim to perform spectroscopy
on extrasolar Earths; TPF-C will operate in visible light, and TPF-I will
operate in the mid-infrared. Extrasolar Earths are assumed to be roughly 26
magnitude in V band, roughly 0.3 microJy in the mid-IR, and located as close as
roughly 30 milliarcseconds from a reasonable set of target stars, demanding
high sensitivity, angular resolution and dynamic range to study. With
capabilities matched to this task, the TPF missions could easily undertake a
broad range of further scientific investigations. This document discusses the
potential of TPF for general astrophysics and comparative planetology beyond
its base mission, focusing on science obtainable with no or minimal
modifications to the mission design, but also exploring possible modifications
to TPF with high scientific merit and no impact on the basic search for
extrasolar Earth analogs. It addresses both TPF-C and TPF-I, but emphasizes
TPF-C, because its launch is planned for 2015, while TPF-I s nominal launch
date is in 2019. This document does not attempt to describe all of the
astrophysics TPF will be capable of, only to present some highlights of a
meeting held at Princeton University, April 14 15, 2004, and some discussions
that followed from that meeting.",2005-05-05T15:35:49Z
"High Resolution Gratings Spectroscopy of GRBs 030382 and 041006 with
  Chandra LETGS","We present high resolution X-ray spectroscopy of two recent GRB afterglows
observed with the Low Energy Transmission Gratings on Chandra. The afterglows
to GRBs 030328 and 041006 are detected beginning 15.33 and 16.8 hours after
each burst, respectively, and are observed to fade in time during each ~90 ksec
observation. We fit for the continuum emission in each full data set and for
the data sliced into half and quarter time sections. For both afterglows, the
continuum emission is well described by an absorbed power-law model, and the
model parameters describing the absorption and spectral slope do not appear to
evolve in time. We perform a careful search for deviations from the model
continua for the full and time-sliced data and find no evidence for significant
(>~3sigma) narrow emission/absorption lines or edges. The lack of detections
implies that line emission--if it is a general feature in GRB X-ray
afterglows--occurs early (t~0.3 days in the source frame) and/or is short-lived
(dt<~10 ksec). We also comment on synchrotron fireball models for the X-ray and
optical data.",2005-02-17T15:24:59Z
A New Detached M Dwarf Eclipsing Binary,"We describe a newly-discovered detached M-dwarf eclipsing binary system, the
fourth such system known. This system was first observed by the TrES network
during a long term photometry campaign of 54 nights. Analysis of the folded
light curve indicates two very similar components orbiting each other with a
period of 1.12079 +/- 0.00001 days. Spectroscopic observations with the
Hobby-Eberly Telescope show the system to consist of two M3e dwarfs in a
near-circular orbit. Double-line radial velocity amplitudes, combined with the
orbital inclination derived from light-curve fitting, yield Mass total = 0.983
+/- 0.007 solar masses, with component masses M(1) = 0.493 +/- 0.003 and M(2) =
0.489 +/- 0.003 solar masses. The light-curve fit yields component radii of
R(1) = 0.453 +/- 0.060 and R(2) = 0.452 +/- 0.050 solar radii. Though a precise
parallax is lacking, broadband VJHK colors and spectral typing suggest
component absolute magnitudes of M_V(1) = 11.18 +/- 0.30 and M_V(2) = 11.28 +/-
0.30.",2005-04-22T00:36:54Z
GRB afterglows: deep Newtonian phase and its application,"Gamma-ray burst afterglows have been observed for months or even years in a
few cases. It deserves noting that at such late stages, the remnants should
have entered the deep Newtonian phase, during which the majority of
shock-accelerated electrons will no longer be highly relativistic. To calculate
the afterglows, we must assume that the electrons obey a power-law distribution
according to their kinetic energy, not simply the Lorentz factor.",2005-02-26T02:47:43Z
Halo Geometry and Dark Matter Annihilation Signal,"We study the impact of the halo shape and geometry on the expected weakly
interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter annihilation signal from the
galactic center. As the halo profile in the innermost region is still poorly
constrained, we consider different density behaviors like flat cores, cusps and
spikes, as well as geometrical distortions. We show that asphericity has a
strong impact on the annihilation signal when the halo profile near the
galactic center is flat, but becomes gradually less significant for cuspy
profiles, and negligible in the presence of a central spike. However, the
astrophysical factor is strongly dependent on the WIMP mass and annihilation
cross-section in the latter case.",2005-04-28T13:38:53Z
"Measuring High Moments of Galaxy Angular Distribution in the First Look
  Survey using Infrared Array Camera","We present the results of using three methods, the probability distribution
function, the Renyi information, and the multi-fractals, to measure the high
moments of galaxy angular distribution in the Infrared Array Camera data of the
Spitzer First Look Survey. This is the first time that Renyi information is
explicitly used to describe the large-scale galaxy spatial distribution, and
our galaxy samples are also the first of the kind in their wavelengths and
sensitivities.",2005-03-03T19:53:32Z
"Evolution of accretion disks around massive black holes: constraints
  from the demography of active galactic nuclei","Observations have shown that the Eddington ratios (the ratio of the
bolometric luminosity to the Eddington luminosity) in QSOs/active galactic
nuclei (AGNs) cover a wide range. In this paper we connect the demography of
AGNs obtained by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with the accretion physics around
massive black holes and propose that the diversity in the Eddington ratios is a
natural result of the long-term evolution of accretion disks in AGNs. The
observed accretion rate distribution of AGNs (with host galaxy velocity
dispersion sigma~70-200 km/s) in the nearby universe (z<0.3) is consistent with
the predictions of simple theoretical models in which the accretion rates
evolve in a self-similar way. We also discuss the implications of the results
for the issues related to self-gravitating disks, coevolution of galaxies and
QSOs/AGNs, and the unification picture of AGNs.",2005-02-23T22:04:51Z
Magneto-rotational overstability in accretion disks,"We present analytical and numerical studies of magnetorotational
instabilities occuring in magnetized accretion disks. In these studies we make
use of the linearised compressible MHD equations. These calculations are
performed for general radially stratified disks in the cylindrical limit. In
particular, we investigate the influence of nonvanishing toroidal magnetic
field component on the growth rate and oscillation frequency of
magnetorotational instabilities in Keplerian disks. We find the persistence of
these instabilities in accretion disks close to equipartition. Our calculations
show that these eigenmodes become overstable (complex eigenvalue), due to the
presence of a toroidal magnetic field component, while their growth rate
reduces slightly. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of
magneto-rotational overstabilities in weakly magnetized sub-Keplerian rotating
disks. We show that the growth rate scales with the rotation frequency of the
disk. These eigenmodes also have a nonzero oscillation frequency, due to the
presence of the dominant toroidal magnetic field component. The overstable
character of the MRI increases as the rotation frequency of the disk decreases.",2005-04-18T10:11:29Z
"On Statistical Lensing and the Anti-Correlation Between 2dF QSOs and
  Foreground Galaxies","We cross-correlate APM and SDSS galaxies with background QSOs from the 2dF
QSO Redshift Survey, and detect a significant (2.8sigma) anti-correlation. The
lack of a signal between 2dF stars and our galaxy samples suggests the
anti-correlation is not due to a systematic error. The possibility that dust in
the foreground galaxies could produce the anti-correlation is marginally
rejected, at the 2sigma level through consideration of QSO colours. It is
possible that dust that obscures QSOs without reddening them, or preferentially
discards reddened QSOs from the 2QZ sample, could produce such an
anti-correlation, however, such models are at odds with the positive QSO-galaxy
correlations found at bright magnitudes by other authors. Our detection of a
galaxy-QSO anti-correlation is consistent with statistical lensing theory. When
combined with earlier results that have reported a positive galaxy-QSO
correlation, a consistent, compelling picture emerges that spans faint and
bright QSO samples showing positive or negative correlations according to the
QSO N(m) slope. We find that galaxies are highly anti-biased on small scales.
We consider two models that use different descriptions of the lensing matter
and find they yield consistent predictions for the strength of galaxy bias on
0.1Mpc/h scales of b~0.1 (for LCDM). Whilst the slope of our power-law fit to
the QSO-galaxy cross-correlation does not rule out linear bias, when we compare
our measurement of b on 100 kpc/h scales to independent methods that determine
b~1 on Mpc/h scales, we conclude that bias, on these small scales, is
scale-dependent. These results indicate more mass, at least on the 100 kpc/h
scales probed, than predicted by simple LCDM biasing prescriptions, and can
thus constrain halo occupation models of the galaxy distribution.",2005-02-23T15:19:48Z
"Gamma-Ray Burst Prompt Emission: Implications from Shock Acceleration
  Theory","The principal paradigm for gamma-ray bursts suggest that the prompt transient
gamma-ray signal arises from multiple shocks internal to the relativistic
expansion. This paper illustrates some properties of diffusive acceleration at
relativistic shocks that pertain to GRB models, providing interpretation of the
BATSE/EGRET data. Using a standard Monte Carlo simulation, computations of the
spectral shape, and the range of spectral indices are presented, as functions
of the shock speed, magnetic field obliquity and the type of particle
scattering. It is clear that while quasi-parallel, relativistic shocks with
fields approximately normal to the shock plane can efficiently accelerate
particles, highly oblique and perpendicular ones cannot unless the particle
diffusion is almost isotropic, i.e. extremely close to the Bohm limit.
Accordingly, an array of distribution indices should be present in the burst
population, as is exhibited by the EGRET data, and even mildly-relativistic
internal shocks require strong field turbulence in order to model the >100 MeV
observations. In addition, recent spectral fitting to burst data in the BATSE
band is discussed, providing probes of the efficiency of injection of
non-thermal electrons.",2005-02-08T03:31:06Z
X-ray Emission from Hot Gas in Galaxy Mergers,"We examine X-ray emission produced from hot gas during collisions and mergers
of disk galaxies. To study this process, we employ simulations that incorporate
cosmologically motivated disk-galaxy models and include the effects of
radiative cooling, star formation, supernova feedback, and accreting
supermassive black holes. We find that during a merger, the colliding gas in
the disks is shock-heated to X-ray-emitting temperatures. The X-ray luminosity
is spatially extended, rises during the initial stages of the merger, and peaks
when the galactic centers coalesce. When a physical model for accreting black
holes is included, the resulting feedback can drive powerful winds that
contribute significantly to the amount and metallicity of hot gas, both of
which increase the X-ray luminosity. In terms of their stellar kinematics and
structural properties, the merger remnants in our simulations resemble
elliptical galaxies. We find that the X-ray luminosities of the remnants with
B-band luminosities in the range L_B ~ 10^10 - 10^11 Lsun are consistent with
observations, while remnants with smaller or larger masses are underluminous in
X-rays. Moreover, because the majority of the merger remnants are broadly
consistent with the observed scaling relations between temperature, B-band
luminosity and X-ray luminosity we conclude that major mergers are a viable
mechanism for producing the X-ray halos of large, luminous elliptical galaxies.",2005-04-06T18:22:47Z
Curvature driven acceleration : a utopia or a reality ?,"The present work shows that a combination of nonlinear contribution from the
Ricci curvature in Einstein field equations can drive a late time acceleration
of expansion of the universe. The transit from the decelerated to the
accelerated phase of expansion takes place smoothly without having to resort to
a study of asymptotic behaviour. This result emphasizes the need for thorough
and critical examination of models with nonlinear contribution from the
curvature.",2005-05-05T12:32:31Z
"Optimization of time data codification and transmission schemes:
  Application to Gaia","Gaia is an ambitious space observatory devoted to obtain the largest and most
precise astrometric catalogue of astronomical objects from our Galaxy and
beyond. On-board processing and transmission of the huge amount of data
generated by the instruments is one of its several technological challenges.
The measurement time tags are critical for the scientific results of the
mission, so they must be measured and transmitted with the highest precision -
leading to an important telemetry channel occupation. In this paper we present
the optimisation of time data, which has resulted in a useful software tool. We
also present how time data is adapted to the Packet Telemetry standard. The
several communication layers are illustrated and a method for coding and
transmitting the relevant data is described as well. Although our work is
focused on Gaia, the timing scheme and the corresponding tools can be applied
to any other instrument or mission with similar operational principles.",2005-04-15T11:23:10Z
"Discovery and Monitoring of the likely IR Counterpart of SGR 1806-20
  during the 2004 gamma-ray burst-active state","The sky region including the Chandra position of SGR 1806-20 was monitored in
the IR band during 2004, following its increased high energy bursting activity.
Observations were performed using NAOS-CONICA, the adaptive optics IR camera
mounted on Yepun VLT, which provided images of unprecedented quality (FWHM
better than 0.1""). After the 2004 December 27th giant flare, the source
position has been nailed by VLA observations of its radio counterpart, reducing
the positional uncertainty to 0.04"". Using IR data from our monitoring
campaign, we discovered the likely IR counterpart to SGR 1806-20 based on
positional coincidence with the Chandra and VLA uncertainty regions and flux
variability of a factor of about 2 correlated with that at higher energies. We
compare our findings with other isolated neutron star classes thought to be
related, at some level, with SGRs.",2005-06-04T17:39:07Z
HETE-2 Observation of two gamma-ray bursts at z > 3,"GRB 020124 and GRB 030323 constitute half the sample of gamma-ray bursts with
a measured redshift greater than 3. This paper presents the temporal and
spectral properties of these two gamma-ray bursts detected and localized with
HETE-2. While they have nearly identical redshifts (z=3.20 for GRB 020124, and
z=3.37 for GRB 030323), these two GRBs span about an order of magnitude in
fluence, thus sampling distinct regions of the GRB luminosity function. The
properties of these two bursts are compared with those of the bulk of the GRB
population detected by HETE-2. We also discuss the energetics of GRB 020124 and
GRB 030323 and show that they are compatible with the Epeak - Eiso relation
discovered by Amati et al. (2002). Finally, we compute the maximum redshifts at
which these bursts could have been detected by HETE-2 and we address various
issues connected with the detection and localization of high-z GRBs.",2005-02-23T20:34:25Z
A Detailed Spectroscopic and Photometric Analysis of DQ White Dwarfs,"We present an analysis of spectroscopic and photometric observations of cool
DQ white dwarfs based on improved model atmosphere calculations. In particular,
we revise the atmospheric parameters of the trigonometric parallax sample of
Bergeron, Leggett, & Ruiz, and discuss the astrophysical implications on the
temperature scale and mean mass, as well as the chemical evolution of these
stars. We also analyze 40 new DQ stars discovered in the first data release of
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our analysis confirms that effective temperatures
derived from model atmospheres including carbon are significantly lower than
the temperatures obtained from pure helium models. Similarly the mean mass of
the trigonometric parallax sample, <M> = 0.62 Mo, is significantly lower than
that obtained from pure helium models, <M> = 0.73 Mo, and more consistent with
the spectroscopic mean mass of DB stars, <M> = 0.59 Mo, the most likely
progenitors of DQ white dwarfs. We find that DQ stars form a remarkably well
defined sequence in a carbon abundance versus effective temperature diagram;
below Teff~10,000 K, carbon pollution decreases monotonically with decreasing
effective temperature. Improved evolutionary models including diffusion and
connecting to the PG 1159 phase are used to infer a typical value for the
thickness of the helium layer M_He/M_* between 10^{-3} and 10^{-2}, compatible
with the predictions of post-AGB models.",2005-03-21T18:10:29Z
"The Angular Momentum Content and Evolution of Class I and Flat-Spectrum
  Protostars","We report on the angular momentum content of heavily embedded protostars
based on our analysis of the projected rotation velocities (v sin i s) of 38
Class I/flat spectrum young stellar objects presented by Doppmann et al (2005).
After correcting for projection effects, we find that infrared-selected Class
I/flat spectrum objects rotate significantly more quickly (median equatorial
rotation velocity ~ 38 km/sec) than Classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs; median
equatorial rotation velocity ~ 18 km/sec) in the Rho Ophiuchi and
Taurus-Aurigae regions. The detected difference in rotation speeds between
Class I/flat spectrum sources and CTTSs proves difficult to explain without
some mechanism which transfers angular momentum out of the protostar between
the two phases. Assuming Class I/flat spectrum sources possess physical
characteristics (M_*,R_*,B_*) typical of pre-main sequence stars, fully disk
locked Class I objects should have co-rotation radii within their protostellar
disks that match well (within 30%) with the predicted magnetic coupling radii
of Shu et al (1994). The factor of two difference in rotation rates between
Class I/flat spectrum and CTTS sources, when interpreted in the context of disk
locking models, also imply a factor of 5 or greater difference in mass
accretion rates between the two phases.",2005-02-23T21:52:01Z
Extrasolar Carbon Planets,"We suggest that some extrasolar planets <~ 60 Earth masses will form
substantially from silicon carbide and other carbon compounds. Pulsar planets
and low-mass white dwarf planets are especially good candidate members of this
new class of planets, but these objects could also conceivably form around
stars like the Sun. This planet-formation pathway requires only a factor of two
local enhancement of the protoplanetary disk's C/O ratio above solar, a
condition that pileups of carbonaceous grains may create in ordinary
protoplanetary disks. Hot, Neptune-mass carbon planets should show a
significant paucity of water vapor in their spectra compared to hot planets
with solar abundances. Cooler, less massive carbon planets may show
hydrocarbon-rich spectra and tar-covered surfaces. The high sublimation
temperatures of diamond, SiC, and other carbon compounds could protect these
planets from carbon depletion at high temperatures.",2005-04-08T20:12:45Z
Gamma-ray burst spectra from continuously accelerated electrons,"We discuss here constraints on the particle acceleration models from the
observed gamma-ray bursts spectra. The standard synchrotron shock model assumes
that some fraction of available energy is given instantaneously to the
electrons which are injected at high Lorentz factor. The emitted spectrum in
that case corresponds to the spectrum of cooling electrons, F_\nu ~ \nu^{-1/2},
is much too soft to account for the majority of the observed spectral slopes.
We show that continuous heating of electrons over the life-time of a source is
needed to produce hard observed spectra. In this model, a prominent peak
develops in the electron distribution at energy which is a strong function of
Thomson optical depth \tau_T of heated electrons (pairs). At \tau_T>1, a
typical electron Lorentz factor \gamma ~ 1-2 and quasi-thermal Comptonization
operates. It produces spectrum peaking at a too high energy. Optical depths
below 10^{-4} would be difficult to imagine in any physical scenario. At \tau_T
=10^{-4}-10^{-2}, \gamma ~ 30-100 and synchrotron self-Compton radiation is the
main emission mechanism. The synchrotron peak should be observed at 10--100 eV,
while the self-absorbed low-energy tail with F_\nu ~ \nu^2 can produce the
prompt optical emission (like in the case of GRB 990123). The first Compton
scattering radiation by nearly monoenergetic electrons peaks in the BATSE
energy band and can be as hard as F_\nu ~ \nu^1 reproducing the hardness of
most of the observed GRB spectra. The second Compton peak should be observed in
the high-energy gamma-ray band, possibly being responsible for the 10-100 MeV
emission detected in GRB 941017. A significant electron-positron pair
production reduces the available energy per particle, moving spectral peaks to
lower energies as the burst progresses.",2005-02-21T17:34:27Z
"The origin of nitrogen: Implications of recent measurements of N/O in
  Galactic metal-poor stars","Recent new high-precision abundance data for Galactic halo stars suggest
important primary nitrogen production in very metal-poor massive stars. Here,
we compute a new model for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way aimed at
explaining these new abundance data. The new data can be explained by adopting:
a) the stellar yields obtained from stellar models that take into account
rotation and b) an extra production of nitrogen in the very metal-poor massive
stars. In particular, we suggest an increase of nearly a factor of 200 in 14N
for a star of 60 Msun and 40 for a star of 9Msun, for metallicities below
Z=10$^{-5}$, with respect to the yields given in the literature for Z=10$^{-5}$
and rotational velocity of 300 km/s. We show that once we adopt the above
prescriptions, our model is able to predict high N/O abundance ratios at low
metallicities and still explains the nitrogen abundances observed in thin disk
stars in the solar vicinity. The physical motivation for a larger nitrogen
production in massive stars in very metal-poor environments could be the fact
that some stellar models as well as observational data suggest that at low
metallicities stars rotate faster. If this is the case, such large nitrogen
production seen in the pristine phases of the halo formation would not
necessarily happen in Damped Lyman-alpha systems which have metallicities
always above [Fe/H]$\simeq -$2.5, and could have been pre-enriched. We also
compute the abundance gradient of N/O along the Galactic disk and show that a
negative gradient is predicted once we adopt stellar yields where rotation is
taken into account. The latter result implies that intermediate mass stars
contribute less to the primary nitrogen than previously thought.",2005-03-23T17:44:01Z
An Atlas of Spectrophotometric Landolt Standard Stars,"We present CCD observations of 102 Landolt standard stars obtained with the
R-C spectrograph on the CTIO 1.5 m telescope. Using stellar atmosphere models
we have extended the flux points to our six spectrophotometric secondary
standards, in both the blue and the red, allowing us to produce flux-calibrated
spectra that span a wavelength range from 3050 \AA to 1.1 \micron. Mean
differences between UBVRI spectrophotometry computed using Bessell's standard
passbands and Landolt's published photometry is found to be 1% or less.
Observers in both hemispheres will find these spectra useful for
flux-calibrating spectra and through the use of accurately constructed
instrumental passbands be able to compute accurate corrections to bring
instrumental magnitudes to any desired standard photometric system
(S-corrections). In addition, by combining empirical and modeled spectra of the
Sun, Sirius and Vega, we calculate and compare synthetic photometry to observed
photometry taken from the literature for these three stars.",2005-04-11T15:22:19Z
"Modelling the ultraviolet/submillimeter spectral energy distributions of
  normal galaxies","We give an overview of the factors shaping the ultraviolet (UV)/optical -

influen ce of the geometry of dust and stars on the propagation of light
through the int erstellar medium. Although strong constraints can be placed on
the amount and la rge scale distribution of dust in disks from the appearance
of the galaxies in t he optical/UV range, this dust does not account for the
observed amplitude and c olour of the FIR/submm radiation. Additional,
optically thick components of dust associated with the young stellar population
on large and small scales are requ ired to account for the complete UV/optical
- FIR/submm SEDs. Self-consistent mo dels for the calculation of SEDs of spiral
galaxies are reviewed, and their pred ictions for the dust emission and the

An interferometric CO survey of luminous submm galaxies,"In this paper we present results from an IRAM Plateau de Bure millimetre-wave
Interferometer (PdBI) survey for CO emission towards radio-detected
submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) with known optical and near-infrared
spectroscopic redshifts. Five sources in the redshift range z~1-3.5 were
detected, nearly doubling the number of SMGs detected in CO. We summarise the
properties of all 12 CO-detected SMGs, as well as 6 sources not detected in CO
by our survey, and use this sample to explore the bulk physical properties of
the SMG population as a whole. The median CO line luminosity of the SMGs is
<L_CO> = (3.8 +- 2.0) x 10^10 K km/s pc^2. Using a CO-to-H_2 conversion factor
appropriate for starburst galaxies, this corresponds to a molecular gas mass
<M(H_2)> = (3.0 +- 1.6) x 10^10 Msun within a ~2kpc radius, about four times
greater than the most luminous local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs)
but comparable to that of the most extreme high-redshift radio galaxies and
QSOs. The median CO fwhm linewidth is broad, <fwhm> = 780 +- 320 km/s, and the
SMGs often have double peaked line profiles, indicative of either a merger or a
disk. From their median gas reservoirs (~3 x 10^10 Msun) and star-formation
rates (>700 Msun/yr) we estimate a lower limit on the typical gas-depletion
time scale of >40Myr in SMGs. This is marginally below the typical age expected
for the starbursts in SMGs, and suggests that negative feedback processes may
play an important role in prolonging the gas consumption time scale. We find a
statistically-significant correlation between the far-infrared and CO
luminosities of the SMGs which extends the observed correlation for local
ULIRGs to higher luminosities and higher redshifts. [ABRIDGED]",2005-03-02T21:10:32Z
Infrared radiation from an extrasolar planet,"A class of extrasolar giant planets - the so-called `hot Jupiters' - orbit
within 0.05 AU of their primary stars. These planets should be hot and so emit
detectable infrared radiation. The planet HD 209458b is an ideal candidate for
the detection and characterization of this infrared light because it is
eclipsed by the star. This planet has an anomalously large radius (1.35 times
that of Jupiter), which may be the result of ongoing tidal dissipation, but
this explanation requires a non-zero orbital eccentricity (~0.03), maintained
by interaction with a hypothetical second planet. Here we report detection of
infrared (24 micron) radiation from HD 209458b, by observing the decrement in
flux during secondary eclipse, when the planet passes behind the star. The
planet's 24 micron flux is 55 +/- 10 micro-Jy (1 sigma), with a brightness
temperature of 1130 +/- 150 Kelvins, confirming the predicted heating by
stellar irradiation. The secondary eclipse occurs at the midpoint between
transits of the planet in front of the star (to within +/- 7 min, 1 sigma),
which means that a dynamically significant orbital eccentricity is unlikely.",2005-03-24T21:05:04Z
"Proper Motions of the BN Object and the I Radio Source in Orion: Where
  and When Did BN Become a Runaway Star?","We present absolute astrometry of the core of the Orion molecular cloud, made
with Very Large Array archive data taken over the last two decades. Our
analysis reveals that both the BN object and the radio source I have proper
motions: the BN object has a proper motion of $12.6 \pm 0.6$ mas yr$^{-1}$
(corresponding to a velocity of $27 \pm 1$ km s$^{-1}$ at an adopted distance
of 450 pc) to the northwest, while the radio source I has a proper motion of
$5.6 \pm 0.7$ mas yr$^{-1}$ (corresponding to a velocity of $12 \pm 2$ km
s$^{-1}$) to the southeast. The motion of the two sources is nearly
antiparallel, diverging from a point in between them, where they were located
about 500 years ago. These results suggest that the BN object and the radio
source I were part of a multiple young stellar system that disintegrated in the
recent past.",2005-04-06T02:11:43Z
"The location of the broad HI absorption in 3C305: clear evidence for a
  jet-accelerated neutral outflow","We present high-spatial resolution 21-cm HI VLA observations of the radio
galaxy 3C305 (z=0.041). These new high-resolution data show that the ~1000 km/s
broad HI absorption, earlier detected in low-resolution WSRT observations, is
occurring against the bright, eastern radio lobe, about 1.6 kpc from the
nucleus. We use new optical spectra taken with the WHT to make a detailed
comparison of the kinematics of the neutral hydrogen with that of the ionised
gas. The striking similarity between the complex kinematics of the two gas
phases suggests that both the ionised gas and the neutral gas are part of the
same outflow. Earlier studies of the ionised gas had already found evidence for
a strong interaction between the radio jet and the interstellar medium at the
location of the eastern radio lobe. Our results show that the fast outflow
produced by this interaction also contains a component of neutral atomic
hydrogen. The most likely interpretation is that the radio jet ionises the ISM
and accelerates it to the high outflow velocities observed. Our observations
demonstrate that, following this strong jet-cloud interaction, not all gas
clouds are destroyed and that part of the gas can cool and become neutral. The
mass outflow rate measured in 3C~305 is comparable, although at the lower end
of the distribution, to that found in Ultra-Luminous IR galaxies. This suggests
that AGN-driven outflows, and in particular jet-driven outflows, can have a
similar impact on the evolution of a galaxy as starburst-driven superwinds.",2005-05-18T07:45:59Z
The HI Properties and Environment of Lyman-alpha Absorbers,"We present results from two projects in which we have used the HI 21cm
emission line as a tracer of gas-rich galaxy populations in the vicinity of
Lyman-alpha absorbers. In the first case, we examine the HI environment of SBS
1543+593, the nearest damped Lyman-alpha absorber. We use a VLA map of the
region around this LSB galaxy which itself shows an extended HI disk to
identify 3 gas rich neighbors within 185 kpc. While it is not clear whether we
should expect local damped Lyman-alpha systems to reside in such gas-rich
regions, we would expect this kind of environment to be more prevalent at
higher redshifts where less of the gas is in the dense inner regions of
galaxies or has been consumed by star formation. This local galaxy is the only
system in which we can study the gaseous environment in this kind of detail. In
the second case, we examine the HI environment surrounding 16 Lyman-alpha
forest absorbers along 4 QSO sightlines. We do not detect any gas-rich galaxies
at the absorber positions indicating that, at least down to our sensitivity
limits, these absorption lines do not seem to be associated with galaxy halos.
For half of the Lyman-alpha absorption systems there is a galaxy within 500
kpc, but for the other half there is not. In two cases there is no galaxy
within 2 Mpc of the Lyman-alpha absorption systems indicating that absorbers
do, in some cases, reside in voids.",2005-04-20T15:43:46Z
The Effects of Gravitational Back-Reaction on Cosmological Perturbations,"Because of the non-linearity of the Einstein equations, the cosmological
fluctuations which are generated during inflation on a wide range of
wavelengths do not evolve independently. In particular, to second order in
perturbation theory, the first order fluctuations back-react both on the
background geometry and on the perturbations themselves. I this paper, the
gravitational back-reaction of long wavelength (super-Hubble) scalar metric
fluctuations on the perturbations themselves is investigated for a large class
of inflationary models. Specifically, the equations describing the evolution of
long wavelength cosmological metric and matter perturbations in an inflationary
universe are solved to second order in both the amplitude of the perturbations
and in the slow roll expansion parameter. Assuming that the linear fluctuations
have random phases, we show that the fractional correction to the power
spectrum due to the leading infrared back-reaction terms does not change the
shape of the spectrum. The amplitude of the effect is suppressed by the product
of the inflationary slow-roll parameter and the amplitude of the linear power
spectrum. The non-gaussianity of the spectrum induced by back-reaction is
commented upon.",2005-05-11T21:24:05Z
Cosmic Shear of the Microwave Background: The Curl Diagnostic,"Weak-lensing distortions of the cosmic-microwave-background (CMB) temperature
and polarization patterns can reveal important clues to the intervening
large-scale structure. The effect of lensing is to deflect the primary
temperature and polarization signal to slightly different locations on the sky.
Deflections due to density fluctuations, gradient-type for the gradient of the
projected gravitational potential, give a direct measure of the mass
distribution. Curl-type deflections can be induced by, for example, a
primordial background of gravitational waves from inflation or by second-order
effects related to lensing by density perturbations. Whereas gradient-type
deflections are expected to dominate, we show that curl-type deflections can
provide a useful test of systematics and serve to indicate the presence of
confusing secondary and foreground non-Gaussian signals.",2005-02-28T21:02:54Z
"Panoramic Views of Cluster-Scale Assemblies Explored by Subaru
  Wide-Field Imaging","We have started PISCES project; a panoramic imaging and spectroscopic survey
of distant clusters on Subaru. It exploits the unique wide-field imaging
capability of Suprime-Cam, which provides a 34'x27' field of view corresponding
to a physical area of 16x13Mpc^2 at z~1. We plan to target 15 clusters in total
at 0.4<z<1.3. In this paper, we report on our first results concerning the
inner structures and large-scale structures of two distant clusters at z=0.55
and 0.83 together with the earlier results on a z=0.41 cluster. The photometric
redshift technique has been applied to multi-color data in order to efficiently
remove most of the foreground/background galaxies so as to isolate the cluster
member candidates. We have found large-scale filamentary structures around the
clusters, extending out to >5Mpc from the cores, as well as complex inner
structures. The galaxy distributions in the inner regions of the clusters look
similar to the X-ray intensity maps, suggesting that most of the optical
structures trace physically bound systems. We also compared the structures of
the three clusters with those of model clusters in a numerical simulation
(N-body + semi-analytic model) by parameterising the shapes of the iso-density
contours of galaxies, and found a broad agreement. Our results provide good
evidence that cluster-scale assembly takes place along filaments during
hierarchical clustering, while the structures found here need to be confirmed
spectroscopically in the near future.",2005-02-22T09:53:05Z
Photon dominated regions in the spiral arms of M83 and M51,"We present CI 3P1-3P0 spectra at four spiral arm positions and the nuclei of
the nearby galaxies M83 and M51 obtained at the JCMT. This data is complemented
with maps of CO 1-0, 2-1, and 3-2, and ISO/LWS far-infrared data of CII (158
micron), OI (63 micron), and NII (122 micron) allowing for the investigation of
a complete set of all major gas cooling lines. From the intensity of the NII
line, we estimate that between 15% and 30% of the observed CII emission
originate from the dense ionized phase of the ISM. The analysis indicates that
emission from the diffuse ionized medium is negligible. In combination with the
FIR dust continuum, we find gas heating efficiencies below ~0.21% in the
nuclei, and between 0.25 and 0.36% at the outer positions. Comparison with
models of photon-dominated regions (PDRs) of Kaufman et al. (1999) with the
standard ratios OI(63)/CII_PDR and (OI(63)+CII_PDR) vs. TIR, the total infrared
intensity, yields two solutions. The physically most plausible solution
exhibits slightly lower densities and higher FUV fields than found when using a
full set of line ratios, CII_PDR/CI(1-0), CI(1-0)/CO(3-2), CO(3-2)/CO(1-0),
CII/CO(3-2), and, OI(63)/CII_PDR. The best fits to the latter ratios yield
densities of 10^4 cm^-3 and FUV fields of ~G_0=20-30 times the average
interstellar field without much variation. At the outer positions, the observed
total infrared intensities are in perfect agreement with the derived best
fitting FUV intensities. The ratio of the two intensities lies at 4-5 at the
nuclei, indicating the presence of other mechanisms heating the dust.",2005-05-31T17:04:18Z
The extended hard X-ray emission from the Vela Plerion,"We present the results of a broad band (3-200 keV) spectral analysis of
BeppoSAX and XMM-Newton observations of the Vela plerion. The hard X-ray (> 15
keV) emission is found to be extended over a region of 12'-15' radius,
corresponding to a size of about 1.0--1.3 pc for a source distance of 290 pc. A
single power law does not give an acceptable fit while a broken power law or a
log-parabolic law nicely fit the data. The former spectral model has the photon
index Gamma_1 = 1.66 +/- 0.01 for energies lower than the break value equal to
12.5 keV and the index Gamma_2 = 2.01 +/- 0.05 up to about 200 keV. The total
X-ray luminosity of the Vela plerionis L_X=5.5E+33 erg/s, which implies a
conversion factor of the spin--down power of about 1.E-03.",2005-03-11T13:29:12Z
"A Photometric Redshift Galaxy Catalog from the Red-Sequence Cluster
  Survey","The Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS) provides a large and deep photometric
catalog of galaxies in the $z'$ and $R_c$ bands for ~90 square degrees of sky,
and supplemental $V$ and $B$ data have been obtained for 33.6 deg$^{2}$. We
compile a photometric redshift catalog from these 4-band data by utilizing the
empirical quadratic polynomial photometric redshift fitting technique in
combination with CNOC2 and GOODS/HDF-N redshift data. The training set includes
4924 spectral redshifts. The resulting catalog contains more than one million
galaxies with photometric redshifts $< 1.5$ and $R_c < 24$, giving an rms
scatter $\sigma(\Delta{z}) < 0.06$ within the redshift range $0.2 < z < 0.5$
and $\sigma(\Delta{z}) < 0.11$ for galaxies at $0.0 < z < 1.5$. We describe the
empirical quadratic polynomial photometric redshift fitting technique which we
use to determine the relation between redshift and photometry. A kd-tree
algorithm is used to divide up our sample to improve the accuracy of our
catalog. We also present a method for estimating the photometric redshift error
for individual galaxies. We show that the redshift distribution of our sample
is in excellent agreement with smaller and much deeper photometric and
spectroscopic redshift surveys.",2005-02-08T17:58:07Z
A substellar companion around the intermediate-mass giant star HD 11977,"We report the discovery of a substellar companion to the intermediate-mass
star HD 11977 (G5 III). Radial velocities of this star have been monitored for
five years with FEROS at the 1.52-m ESO and later at the 2.2-m MPG/ESO
telescope in La Silla, Chile. Based on the collected data we calculated an
orbital solution with a period of P=711 days, a semi-amplitude of K1=105 m/s,
and an eccentricity of e=0.4. The period of the radial-velocity variation is
longer than that of the estimated stellar rotation, rendering it unlikely that
rotational modulation is the source of the variation in the radial velocity.
This hypothesis is supported by the absence of a correlation between stellar
activity indicators and radial-velocity variation. By determining a primary
stellar mass of Mstar=1.91 Msun, the best-fit minimum mass of the companion and
semi-major axis of the orbit are m2sini=6.54 Mjup and a2=1.93 AU, respectively.
An upper limit for the mass of the companion of m2 < 65.5 Mjup has been
calculated from Hipparcos astrometric measurements. Although the possibility of
a brown-dwarf companion cannot be excluded, HD 11977 B is one of the few planet
candidates detected around an intermediate-mass star. The progenitor
main-sequence star of HD 11977 is probably an A-type star. This discovery gives
an indirect evidence for planetary companions around early type main-sequence
stars.",2005-05-25T12:17:37Z
Polarization of L Dwarfs by Dust Scattering,"The degree of polarization in L dwarfs of spectral types L0 to L6 resulting
from dust scattering in a rotation-induced oblate photosphere is calculated.
Assuming that forsterite is the main condensate, the atmospheric dust
distribution is derived for different spectral types based on a chemical
equilibrium model. The degree of polarization at optical is then calculated
using a single scattering model. The expected linear polarization at optical is
found to peak at around spectral type L1. For a fixed rotational velocity, the
degree of polarization decreases from hotter to cooler objects. However, with
the increase in mean grain size, the degree of linear polarization reduces
significantly. We fit the recently observed linear polarimetric data of L
dwarfs and find that single dust scattering model coupled with the chemical
equilibrium models of condensates is consistent with the observational results.",2005-02-16T05:58:17Z
A Search for Giant Pulses from Millisecond Pulsars,"We have searched for microsecond-timescale broadband emission from a sample
of eighteen millisecond pulsars. Our study places strong limits on such
emission from several millisecond pulsars and shows that it is only present in
a small subset of millisecond pulsars. Giant pulses of up to 64 times the mean
pulse energy were detected from PSR J1823-3021A in the globular cluster NGC
6624. In contrast to the giant pulses of PSR B1937+21, nearly all of the giant
pulses from PSR J1823-3021A were distributed within the trailing half of the
main-pulse component of the integrated pulse profile. The fact that no giant
pulses were observed on the leading side of the main-pulse component suggests
that giant pulses are preferentially emitted closer to the last open field line
than ordinary emission. The correlation between giant pulse emissivity and
spin-down luminosity in millisecond pulsars suggests that the high period
derivative of PSR J1823-3021A is intrinsic and is not just an artifact of its
acceleration in the gravitational potential of NGC 6624.",2005-02-09T21:00:44Z
"Detection and imaging of atmospheric radio flashes from cosmic ray air
  showers","The nature of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) at energies >10^20 eV
remains a mystery. They are likely to be of extragalactic origin, but should be
absorbed within ~50 Mpc through interactions with the cosmic microwave
background. As there are no sufficient powerful accelerators within this
distance from the Galaxy, explanations for UHECRs range from unusual
astrophysical sources to exotic string physics. Also unclear is whether UHECRs
consist of protons, heavy nuclei, neutrinos or gamma-rays. To resolve these
questions, larger detectors with higher duty cycles and which combine multiple
detection techniques are needed. Radio emission from UHECRs, on the other hand,
is unaffected by attenuation, has a high duty cycle, gives calorimetric
measurements and provides high directional accuracy. Here we report the
detection of radio flashes from cosmic-ray air showers using low-cost digital
radio receivers. We show that the radiation can be understood in terms of the
geosynchrotron effect. Our results show that it should be possible to determine
the nature and composition of UHECRs with combined radio and particle
detectors, and to detect the ultrahigh-energy neutrinos expected from flavour
mixing.",2005-05-18T17:20:35Z
TeV gamma rays from the Galactic Center,"The recent detection of TeV gamma-radiation from the direction of the
Galactic Center within several arc-minutes around Sgr A* is the first
model-independent evidence of existence of high energy particle accelerator(s)
in the central 10 pc region of our Galaxy. This is an extraordinary site that
harbours many remarkable objects with the compact radio source Sgr A* - a
hypothetical super-massive black hole (SMBH) - in the dynamical center of the
Galaxy. Here we explore the possible direct and indirect links of the reported
TeV emission to the SMBH. We show that at least three $\gamma$-ray production
scenarios that take place close to the event horizon of the SMBH can explain
the reported TeV fluxes. An alternative (or additional) channel of TeV
radiation is related to the run-away protons accelerated in Sgr A*.
Quasi-continuous injection of relativistic protons into the surrounding dense
gas environment initiates detectable high energy gamma-ray emission. The
absolute flux and the energy spectrum of this radiation component strongly
depend on the history of particle injection and the character of diffusion of
protons during the last 10^5 years. For a reasonable combination of a few model
parameters, one can explain the detected gamma-ray flux solely by this diffuse
component.",2005-03-16T16:52:13Z
"Binary Quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: Evidence for Excess
  Clustering on Small Scales","We present a sample of 218 new quasar pairs with proper transverse
separations R_prop < 1 Mpc/h over the redshift range 0.5 < z < 3.0, discovered
from an extensive follow up campaign to find companions around the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey and 2dF Quasar Redshift Survey quasars. This sample includes
26 new binary quasars with separations R_prop < 50 kpc/h (theta < 10
arcseconds), more than doubling the number of such systems known. We define a
statistical sample of binaries selected with homogeneous criteria and compute
its selection function, taking into account sources of incompleteness. The
first measurement of the quasar correlation function on scales 10 kpc/h <
R_prop < 400 kpc/h is presented. For R_prop < 40 kpc/h, we detect an order of
magnitude excess clustering over the expectation from the large scale R_prop >
3 Mpc/h quasar correlation function, extrapolated down as a power law to the
separations probed by our binaries. The excess grows to ~ 30 at R_prop ~ 10
kpc/h, and provides compelling evidence that the quasar autocorrelation
function gets progressively steeper on sub-Mpc scales. This small scale excess
can likely be attributed to dissipative interaction events which trigger quasar
activity in rich environments. Recent small scale measurements of galaxy
clustering and quasar-galaxy clustering are reviewed and discussed in relation
to our measurement of small scale quasar clustering.",2005-04-25T09:42:33Z
Is Thermal Emission in Gamma-Ray Bursts Ubiquitous?,"The prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts has yet defied any simple
explanation, despite the presence of a rich observational material and great
theoretical efforts. Here we show that all the types of spectral evolution and
spectral shapes that have been observed can indeed be described with one and
the same model, namely a hybrid model of a thermal and a non-thermal component.
We further show that the thermal component is the key emission process
determining the spectral evolution. Even though bursts appear to have a variety
of, sometimes complex, spectral evolutions, the behaviors of the two separate
components are remarkably similar for all bursts, with the temperature
describing a broken power-law in time. The non-thermal component is consistent
with emission from a population of fast cooling electrons emitting
optically-thin synchrotron emission or non-thermal Compton radiation. This
indicates that these behaviors are the fundamental and characteristic ones for
gamma-ray bursts.",2005-04-20T20:00:32Z
Size dependence of solar X-ray flare properties,"Non-thermal and thermal parameters of 85 solar flares of GOES class B1 to M6
(background subtracted classes A1 to M6) have been compared to each other. The
hard X-ray flux has been measured by RHESSI and a spectral fitting provided
flux and spectral index of the non-thermal emission, as well as temperature and
emission measure of the thermal emission. The soft X-ray flux was taken from
GOES measurements. We find a linear correlation in a double logarithmic plot
between the non-thermal flux and the spectral index. The higher the
acceleration rate of a flare, the harder the non-thermal electron distribution.
The relation is similar to the one found by a comparison of the same parameters
from several sub-peaks of a single flare. Thus small flares behave like small
subpeaks of large flares. Thermal flare properties such as temperature,
emission measure and the soft X-ray flux also correlate with peak non-thermal
flux. A large non-thermal peak flux entails an enhancement in both thermal
parameters. The relation between spectral index and the non-thermal flux is an
intrinsic feature of the particle acceleration process, depending on flare
size. This property affects the reported frequency distribution of flare
energies.",2005-05-09T12:21:24Z
Kinematics of Ionised Gas in the Barred Seyfert Galaxy NGC 4151,"We have determined the structure and kinematics of ionised gas in the weak
oval bar of the archetypal Seyfert 1 galaxy, NGC 4151, using the TAURUS
Fabry-Perot interferometer to simultaneously map the distribution and
kinematics of Hbeta emission. We also present broad-band ultraviolet imaging of
the host galaxy, obtained with XMM-Newton, that shows the detailed distribution
of star formation in the bar and in the optically-faint outer spiral arms. We
compare the distribution and kinematics of ionised gas with that previously
determined in neutral hydrogen by Mundell & Shone; we suggest that the
distribution of bright, patchy UV emission close to the HI shocks is consistent
with ionisation by star clusters that have formed in compressed pre-shock gas.
These clusters then travel ballistically through the gaseous shock to ionise
gas downstream along the leading edge of the bar. In addition, we detect, for
the first time, ionised gas within the shock itself which is streaming to
smaller radii in the same manner as the neutral gas.",2005-02-14T11:42:14Z
The Rise and Citation Impact of astro-ph in Major Journals,"The rise in the use of the arXiv preprint server (astro-ph) over the past
decade has led to a major shift in the way astronomical research is
disseminated. Schwarz & Kennicutt (2004) recently found that Astrophysical
Journal papers posted to astro-ph are cited roughly twice as often as papers
that are not posted, suggesting that the preprint server has become the primary
resource for many astronomers to keep up with the literature. I describe a
simple method to determine the adoption rate and citation impact of astro-ph
over time for any journal using NASA's Astrophysics Data System (ADS). I use
the ADS to document the rise in the adoption of astro-ph for three major
astronomy journals, and to conduct a broad survey of the citation impact of
astro-ph in 13 different journals. I find that the factor of two boost in
citations for astro-ph papers is a common feature across most of the major
astronomy journals.",2005-03-23T22:41:00Z
"HST/ACS observations of the old and metal-poor Sagittarius dwarf
  irregular galaxy","We have obtained deep color-magnitude diagrams of the Sagittarius dwarf
irregular galaxy with the HST/ACS. The new diagrams unveil for the first time
the star formation history of SagDIG.
  We identify a small population of red horizontal branch stars, which sets the
first epoch of star formation in SagDIG back to ~9-10 Gyr ago. This shows that
SagDIG has been able to maintain a very low mean metallicity (-2.2<[Fe/H]<-1.9)
over a 10 Gyr life time, and most importantly, that all Local Group dwarf
galaxies share an ancient (~10 Gyr) initial episode of star formation. Thus, at
the moment, IZw18 remains the only exception to this general trend, favoring
the so-called ``young galaxy'' scenario. However, a re-analysis of ACS
observations of IZw18 suggests that an older RGB population may be present also
in IZw18.
  We also compare the distribution of atomic hydrogen with that of stellar
populations of various ages. We find little correlation between stellar
populations older than ~1 Gyr and the HI. In particular we fail to find any
generation of stars that preferentially lie within the large HI hole. We
therefore exclude the possibility that the SagDIG ring-like HI distribution is
the result of multiple supernova events. Alternative scenarios have to be
explored.",2005-05-19T09:53:43Z
"Electron-Ion Recombination Rate Coefficients and Photoionization Cross
  Sections for Astrophysically Abundant Elements. IX. Ni XXVI and Ni XXVII for
  UV and X-ray modeling","The inverse processes of photoionization and electron-ion recombination of
(hnu + Ni XXVI --> Ni XXVII + e and (hnu + Ni XXVII --> Ni XXVIII + e) are
studied using the unified method for the total recombination. The method
subsumes both the radiative and di-electronic recombination processes and
enables self-consistent sets of results for photoionization and electron-ion
recombination by using the same wavefunction expansion. Photoionization cross
sections (sigma_PI), recombination cross sections (sigma_{RC}), recombination
collision strengths (Omega_{RC}), and recombination rate coefficients
(alpha_{RC}) are obtained for ionization balance and spectral analysis of UV
and X-ray lines. Level-specific photoionization cross sections and
recombination rates are presented to enable accurate computation of
recombination-cascade matrices for all fine structure levels n(SLJ) up to n <=
10: 98 bound fine structure levels of Ni XXVI with 0 <= l <= 9, 0 <= L <= 11,
1/2 <= J <= 17/2, and 198 levels of Ni XXVII with 0 <= l <= 9, 0 <= L <= 14, 0
<= J <= 10. Total alpha_{RC} for Ni XXVI and Ni XXVII are compared with the
existing values with very good agreement. Total recombination rate coefficients
for the hydrogen-like recombined ion, Ni XXVIII, are also presented. The
calculations are carried out in relativistic Breit-Pauli R-matrix (BPRM)
approximation with inclusion of radiation damping of resonances. With
consideration of all details of the processes, the results, which include the
level specific sigma_{PI} and alpha_{R} calculated for the first time, should
be the most accurate for these ions.",2005-03-08T21:21:32Z
Magnetic Fields in Gamma-Ray Bursts: A Short Review,"Magnetic fields play a crucial role in the physics of Gamma-Ray Bursts
(GRBs). Strong observational evidence indicates that the observed afterglow and
most likely the prompt emission arise from synchrotron emission. It is possible
that Poynting flux plays an important or even dominant role in the relativistic
outflow from the inner engine, but like in other astronomical relativistic jets
this suggestion is controversial. Finally, it is likely that magnetic fields
larger than $10^{15}$ G occur within GRBs' inner engines and contribute to the
acceleration and collimation of the relativistic jets. I review here the GRB
fireball model and discuss the role that magnetic fields play in its various
components. I suggest that the early afterglow, that reflects the initial
interaction of the relativistic jet with its surrounding matter is the best
available tool to explore the nature of relativistic outflow in astronomical
relativistic jets.",2005-03-02T21:56:56Z

The Relationship between Class I and Class II Methanol Masers,"The Australia Telescope National Facility Mopra millimetre telescope has been
used to search for 95.1-GHz class I methanol masers towards sixty-two 6.6-GHz

eighteen of these being new discoveries. Combining the results of this search
with observations reported in the literature, a near complete sample of
sixty-six 6.6-GHz class II methanol masers has been searched in the 95.1-GHz
transition, with detections towards 38 per cent (twenty-five detections ; not
all of the sources studied in this paper qualify for the complete sample, and
some of the sources in the sample were not observed in the present
observations). There is no evidence of an anti-correlation between either the
velocity range, or peak flux density of the class I and II transitions,
contrary to suggestions from previous studies. The majority of class I methanol
maser sources have a velocity range that partially overlaps with the class II
maser transitions. The presence of a class I methanol maser associated with a
class II maser source is not correlated with the presence (or absence) of
main-line OH or water masers. Investigations of the properties of the infrared
emission associated with the maser sources shows no significant difference
between those class II methanol masers with an associated class I maser and
those without. This may be consistent with the hypothesis that the objects
responsible for driving class I methanol masers are generally not those that
produce main-line OH, water or class II methanol masers.",2005-03-15T04:35:27Z
"Seismic diagnostics of mixing beyond the convective core in intermediate
  mass main-sequence stars","We study prospects for seismic sounding the layer of a partial mixing above
the convective core in main-sequence stars with masses in the 1.2 -- 1.9 solar
mass range. There is an initial tendency to an increase of convective core mass
in such stars and this leads to ambiguities in modeling. Solar-like
oscillations are expected to be excited in such objects. Frequencies of such
oscillations provide diagnostics, which are sensitive to the structure of the
innermost part of the star and they are known as the small separations. We
construct evolutionary models of stars in this mass range assuming various
scenarios for element mixing, which includes formation of element abundance
jumps, as well as semiconvective and overshooting layers. We find that the
three point small separations employing frequencies of radial and dipole modes
provide the best probe of the element distribution above the convective core.
With expected accuracy of frequency measurement from the space experiments, a
discrimination between various scenarios should be possible.",2005-05-25T22:33:22Z
Cool White Dwarfs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,"A reduced proper motion diagram utilizing Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
photometry and astrometry and USNO-B plate astrometry is used to separate cool
white dwarf candidates from metal-weak, high-velocity main sequence Population
II stars (subdwarfs) in the SDSS Data Release 2 imaging area. Follow-up
spectroscopy using the Hobby-Eberly Telescope, the MMT, and the McDonald 2.7m
Telescope is used to demonstrate that the white dwarf and subdwarf loci
separate cleanly in the reduced proper motion diagram, and that the
contamination by subdwarfs is small near the cool white dwarf locus. This
enables large statistically complete samples of white dwarfs, particularly the
poorly understood cool white dwarfs, to be created from the SDSS imaging
survey, with important implications for white dwarf luminosity function
studies. SDSS photometry for our sample of cool white dwarfs is compared to
current white dwarf models.",2005-03-28T23:11:31Z
Neutrino-Dominated Accretion and Supernovae,"We suggest that part of the infalling material during the core-collapse of a
massive star goes into orbit around the compact core to form a hot, dense,
centrifugally-supported accretion disk whose evolution is strongly influenced
by neutrino interactions. Under a wide range of conditions, this
neutrino-dominated accretion flow will be advection-dominated and will develop
a substantial outflowing wind. We estimate the energy carried out in the wind
and find that it exceeds $10^{50}$ erg for a wide range of parameters and even
exceeds 10^{51} erg for reasonable parameter choices. We propose that the wind
energy will revive a stalled shock and will help produce a successful supernova
explosion. We discuss the role of the disk wind in both prompt and delayed
explosions. While both scenarios are feasible, we suggest that a delayed
explosion is more likely, and perhaps even unavoidable. Finally, we suggest
that the disk wind may be a natural site for r-process nucleosynthesis.",2005-02-22T23:31:24Z
"Dust Scattering in Miras R Car and RR Sco resolved by optical
  interferometric polarimetry","We present optical interferometric polarimetry measurements of the Mira-like
variables R Car and RR Sco, using the Sydney University Stellar Interferometer.
By making visibility measurements in two perpendicular polarisations, the
relatively low-surface brightness light scattered by atmospheric dust could be
spatially separated from the bright Mira photospheric flux. This is the first
reported successful use of long-baseline optical interferometric polarimetry.
Observations were able to place constraints on the distribution of
circumstellar material in R Car and RR Sco. The inner radius of dust formation
for both stars was found to be less than 3 stellar radii: much closer than the
expected innermost stable location for commonly-assumed astrophysical ``dirty
silicate'' dust in these systems (silicate dust with a significant iron
content). A model with the dust distributed over a shell which is geometrically
thin compared to the stellar radius was preferred over an outflow. We propose
dust components whose chemistry and opacity properties enable survival at these
extreme inner radii.",2005-05-06T01:29:26Z
The population of black widow pulsars,"We consider the population of black widow pulsars (BWPs). The large majority
of these are members of globular clusters. For minimum companion masses < 0.1
Msun, adiabatic evolution and consequent mass loss under gravitational
radiation appear to provide a coherent explanation of all observable
properties. We suggest that the group of BWPs with minimum companion masses >
0.1 Msun are systems relaxing to equilibrium after a relatively recent capture
event. We point out that all binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs) with orbital
periods P < 10 h are BWPs (our line of sight allows us to see the eclipses in
10 out of 16 cases). This implies that recycled MSPs emit either in a wide fan
beam or a pencil beam close to the spin plane. Simple evolutionary ideas favour
a fan beam.",2005-02-24T15:39:59Z
"A Chandra Survey of Early-Type Galaxies, I: Metal Enrichment in the ISM","We present the first in a series of papers studying the X-ray properties of
28 early type galaxies spanning ~3 orders of magnitude in L_x. We report
emission-weighted constraints for Fe, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S and Ni. We find no
evidence of the very sub-solar Z_Fe historically reported, confirming a trend
in recent X-ray observations of bright galaxies and groups, nor do we find Z_Fe
correlates with L_x. In general we find no evidence for multi-phase ISM,
indicating multi-temperature fits found with ASCA were due to temperature
gradients Chandra can resolve. We compare the stellar Z_Fe, estimated from
simple stellar population model fits, to Z_Fe(ISM). Excepting one possible
outlier we find no evidence that the gas is much more metal-poor than the stars
and, in a few systems Z_Fe(ISM) is higher. In general the two exhibit similar
Z_Fe, which is inconsistent with both galactic wind models and recent
hierarchical chemical enrichment simulations. Adopting standard SNIa and SNII
metal yields our abundance ratio constraints imply 66+/-11% of the Fe within
the ISM was produced in SNIa, similar to the Solar neighbourhood and implying
similar enrichment histories for the ISM in a spiral and in elliptical
galaxies. Although these values are sensitive to systematic uncertainties in
the SN yields, they are in good agreement with observations of more massive
systems, indicating remarkable homology in the enrichment process operating
from cluster scales to low-to-intermediate L_x galaxies. The data also
uniformly exhibit the low Z_O/Z_Mg abundance ratios which have been reported in
some other systems. This is inconsistent with metal-production calculations in
SNII and may indicate an additional source of enrichment, such as Population
III hypernovae.(abridged)",2005-04-01T02:29:22Z
"Laboratory simulation of cometary x rays using a high-resolution
  microcalorimeter","X-ray emission following charge exchange has been studied on the University
of California Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory electron beam ion traps
EBIT-I and EBIT-II using a high-resolution microcalorimeter. The measured
spectra include the K-shell emission from hydrogenlike and heliumlike C, N, O,
and Ne needed for simulations of cometary x-ray emission. A comparison of the
spectra produced in the interaction of O8+ with N2 and CH4 is presented that
illustrates the dependence of the observed spectrum on the interaction gas.",2005-06-13T03:58:35Z
Classical Novae as a Probe of the Cataclysmic Variable Population,"Classical Novae (CNe) are the brightest manifestation of mass transfer onto a
white dwarf in a cataclysmic variable (CV). As such, they are probes of the
mass transfer rate, Mdot, and WD mass, Mwd, in these interacting binaries. Our
calculations of the dependence of the CN ignition mass, Mign, on Mdot and Mwd
yields the recurrence times of these explosions. We show that the observed CNe
orbital period distribution is consistent with the interrupted magnetic braking
evolutionary scenario, where at orbital periods Porb > 3 hr mass transfer is
driven by angular momentum loss via a wind from the companion star and at Porb
< 3 hr by gravitational radiation. About 50% of CNe occur in binaries accreting
at Mdot ~= 10^{-9} Msun/yr with Porb = 3-4 hr, with the remaining 50% split
evenly between Porb longer (higher Mdot) and shorter (lower Mdot) than this.
This resolution of the relative contribution to the CN rate from different CVs
tells us that 3(9)x10^5 CVs with WD mass 1.0(0.6)Msun are needed to produce one
CN per year. Using the K-band specific CN rate measured in external galaxies,
we find a CV birthrate of 2(4)x10^{-4}/yr per 10^{10}Lsun,K, very similar to
the luminosity specific Type Ia supernova rate in elliptical galaxies.
Likewise, we predict that there should be 60-180 CVs for every 10^6Lsun,K in an
old stellar population, similar to the number of X-ray identified CVs in the
globular cluster 47 Tuc, showing no overabundance relative to the field. Using
a two-component steady state model of CV evolution we show that the fraction of
CVs which are magnetic (22%) implies a birthrate of 8% relative to non-magnetic
CVs, similar to the fraction of strongly magnetic field WDs. (abridged)",2005-03-24T22:02:40Z
Direct determination of the spiral pattern rotation speed of the Galaxy,"The rotation velocity of the spiral pattern of the Galaxy is determined by
direct observation of the birthplaces of open clusters of stars in the galactic
disk as a function of their age. Our measurement does not depend on any
specific model of the spiral structure, like the existence of a given number of
spiral arms, or the presence of a bar in the central regions. This study became
possible due to the recent completion of a large database on open clusters by
our group. The birthplaces of the clusters are determined by two methods, one
that assumes that the orbits are circular, and the other by integrating the
orbits in the Galactic potential for a time equal to the age of the clusters.
We selected in the database a sample of 212 clusters for which proper motions,
radial velocities, distances and ages are available, or of 612 clusters that
have ages and distances available. We tested different assumptions concerning
the rotation curve and the radius $R_0$ of the solar orbit. Our results confirm
that a dominant fraction of the open clusters are formed in spiral arms, and
that the spiral arms rotate like a rigid body, as predicted by the classical
theory of spiral waves. We find that the corotation radius $R_c$ is close to
the solar galactic orbit ($R_c/R_0 = 1.08 \pm 0.08$). This proximity has many
potentially interesting consequences, like a better preservation of life on the
Earth, and a new understanding of the history of star formation in the solar
neighborhood, and of the evolution of the abundance of elements in the galactic
disk.",2005-03-03T19:36:40Z
"On the existence of three-dimensional hydrostatic and magnetostatic
  equilibria of self-gravitating fluid bodies","(Abridged) We develop an analytical spectral method to solve the equations of
equilibrium for a self-gravitating, magnetized fluid body, under the only
hypotheses that (a) the equation of state is isothermal, (b) the configuration
is scale-free, and (c) the body is electrically neutral. All physical variables
are represented as series of scalar and vector spherical harmonics of degree l
and order m, and the equilibrium equations are reduced to a set of coupled
quadratic algebraic equations for the expansion coefficients of the density and
the magnetic vector potential. The method is general, and allows to recover
previously known hydrostatic and magnetostatic solutions possessing axial
symmetry. A linear perturbation analysis of the equations in spectral form show
that these basic axisymmetric states, considered as a continuos sequence with
the relative amount of magnetic support as control parameter, have in general
no neighboring nonaxisymmetric equilibria. This result lends credence to a
conjecture originally made by H. Grad and extends early results obtained by E.
Parker to the case of self-gravitating magnetized bodies. The only allowed
bifurcations of this sequence of axisymmetric equilibria are represented by
distortions with dipole-like angular dependence (l=1) that can be continued
into the nonlinear regime. These new configurations are either (i) azimuthally
asymmetric (m=+-1) or (ii) azimuthally symmetric but without reflection
symmetry with respect to the equatorial plane (m=0). To the extent that
interstellar clouds can be represented as isolated magnetostatic equilibria,
the results of this study suggest that the observed triaxial shapes of
molecular cloud cores can be interpreted in terms of weakly damped Alfven
oscillations about an equilibrium state.",2005-02-28T17:28:42Z
Constraints on the Progenitor Systems of Type Ia Supernovae,"UVOIR bolometric light curves provide valuable insight into the nature of
type Ia supernovae. We present an analysis of sixteen well-observed SNe Ia.
Constraints are placed on several global parameters concerning the progenitor
system, explosion mechanism and subsequent radiation transport. By fitting a
radioactive decay energy deposition function to the quasi-exponential phase (50
to 100 days after maximum light), it is found that the ejected mass varies by
at least a factor of two. This result suggests that a sub-Chandrasekhar mass
model could be responsible for the progenitor system of some type Ia
supernovae. We find that the range in the amount of synthesized (56)Ni
indicates a significant variation in the burning mechanism. In order to explain
a factor of ten range in the observed bolometric luminosity more detailed
modeling of the explosion mechanism is required.",2005-06-17T14:41:42Z
"Three-dimensional Mapping of CDM Substructure at Submillimeter
  Wavelengths","The cold dark matter (CDM) structure formation model predicts that about 5-10
percent of a typical galactic halo of mass $\sim 10^{12} \ms$ is in
substructures with masses $\lesssim 10^8 \ms$. To directly detect such
substructures, we propose to observe dust continuum emission from a strongly
lensed QSO-host galaxy using a large submillimeter interferometer array with a
high angular resolution of $\sim 0.01$arcsec such as the planned Atacama Large
Submillimeter Array (ALMA). To assess their observational feasibility, we
numerically simulate millilensing of an extended circular source by a CDM
substructure modeled as a tidally truncated singular isothermal sphere (SIS)
embedded in a typical QSO-galaxy lens system, B1422+231, modeled as a singular
isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) with an external constant shear and a constant
convergence. Assuming an angular resolution of 0.01arcsec, we find that the
angular positions of $\sim 10^8 \ms$ substructures at several kpc from the
center of the macrolens halo can be directly measured if the size of the dust
continuum emission region and the gradient of the surface brightness at the
position of the perturber are sufficiently large. From the astrometric shift on
a scale of a few times $10~$mas of an image perturbed by a subhalo with respect
to an unperturbed macrolensed image, we can break the degeneracy between
subhalo mass and distance provided that macrolensing parameters are determined
from positions and fluxes of multiple images.",2005-03-09T12:49:05Z
"Instabilities, turbulence, and mixing in the ocean of accreting neutron
  stars","We consider the stability properties of the ocean of accreting magnetic
neutron stars. It turns out that the ocean is always unstable due to the
combined influence of the temperature and chemical composition gradients along
the surface and of the Hall effect. Both the oscillatory and non-oscillatory
modes can be unstable in accreting stars. The oscillatory instability grows on
a short timescale of the order os 0.1-10 s depending on the lengthscale of a
surface inhomogeneity and the wavelength of perturbations. The instability of
non-oscillatory modes is typically much slower and can develop on a timescale
of hours or days. Instability generates a weak turbulence that can be
responsible for mixing between the surface and deep ocean layers and for
spreading the accreted material over the stellar surface. Spectral features of
heavy elements can be detected in the atmospheres of accreting stars due to
mixing, and these features should be different in neutron stars with stable and
unstable burning. Motions caused by instability can also be the reason for slow
variations in the luminosity.",2005-04-20T13:58:14Z
The velocity field of baryonic gas in the universe,"The dynamic evolution of the baryonic intergalactic medium (IGM) caused by
the underlying dark matter gravity is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations
in which many cooling and heating processes are involved. However, it has long
been recognized that the growth mode dynamics of cosmic matter clustering can
be sketched by a random force driven Burgers' equation if cooling and heating
are ignored. Just how well the dynamics of the IGM can be described as a
Burgers fluid has not been fully investigated probably because cooling and
heating are essential for a detailed understanding of the IGM. Using IGM
samples produced by a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation in which heating and
cooling processes are properly accounted for, we show that the IGM velocity
field in the nonlinear regime shows the features of a Burgers fluid, that is,
when the Reynolds number is high, the velocity field consists of an ensemble of
shocks. Consequently, (1) the IGM velocity $v$ is generally smaller than that
of dark matter; (2) for the smoothed field, the IGM velocity shows tight
correlation with dark matter given by $v \simeq s v_{dm}$, with $s<1$, such
that the lower the redshift, the smaller $s$; (3) the velocity PDFs are
asymmetric between acceleration and deceleration events; (4) the PDF of
velocity difference $\Delta v=v(x+r)-v(x)$ satisfies the scaling relation for a
Burgers fluid, i.e., $P(\Delta v)=(1 r^y)F(\Delta v/r^y)$. We find the scaling
function and parameters for the IGM which are applicable to the entire scale
range of the samples (0.26 - 8 h$^{-1}$ Mpc). These properties show that the
similarity mapping between the IGM and dark matter is violated on scales much
larger than the Jeans length of the IGM.",2005-02-08T23:52:55Z
Scattering properties and composition of cometary dust,"Composition of Comet dust obtained by the dust impact analyser on the Halley
probes indicated that the comet dust is a mixure of silicate and carbonaceous
material. The collected interplanetary dust particles (IDP's) are fluffy and
composite having grains of several different types stuck together. Using
Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) we study the scattering properties of
composite grains. In particular, we study the angular distribution of the
scattered intensity and linear polarization of composite grains. We assume that
the composite grains are made up of host silicate sphere/spheroid with the
inclusions of graphite. Results of our calculations on the composite grains
show that the angle of maximum polarization shifts, and the degree of
polarizaion varies with the volume fraction of inclusions. We use these results
on the composite grains to interpret the observed scattering in the cometary
dust.",2005-04-12T10:30:24Z
New neighbours VI. Spectroscopy of DENIS nearby stars candidates,"We present spectra of 36 nearby star candidates and 3 red giant candidates,
identified in the DENIS database by Phan-Bao et al. (2003). 32 of the dwarf
candidates are indeed nearby red dwarfs, with spectral types from M5.5 to M8.5.
Out of 11 targets with low proper motion (mu < 0.1$ arc-sec/yr) but a Reduced
Proper Motion above an inclusive threshold, 9 are red dwarfs. The 4
contaminants are all reddened F-K main sequence stars, and they could have been
eliminated by checking for some well known high latitude molecular clouds.
These stars might be of interest as probes of interstellar absorption. For the
red dwarfs we derive spectral types and spectroscopic distances, using a new
calibration of the PC3 spectral index to absolute magnitudes in the I, J, H and
K photometric bands.
  We confirm 2 new members of the 12 pc volume (2 new M8.5), and one M7.5 NLTT
object closer than 10pc. We also show that one quarter of the stars with
photometric distances under 30 pc have too small a proper motion for inclusion
in the NLTT catalog.",2005-06-16T02:42:36Z
Infrared Number Counts of AGN in the GOODS Fields,"Using the known numbers and evolution of unobscured AGN, and assuming that
there is a large number of corresponding obscured AGN -- as expected if AGN
unification is correct -- we predict the infrared number counts of AGN. These
agree well with the observed GOODS Spitzer data at 3.6, 8 and 24 $\mu$m,
provided that the dust content of the obscuring torus is $\sim 2$x less than
assumed. This strongly supports the AGN unification picture, and implies a
large population of infrared bright obscured AGN at all redshifts and
luminosities.",2005-03-02T21:17:37Z
Can CCM law properly represent all extinction curves?,"We present the analysis of a large sample of lines of sight with extinction
curves covering wavelength range from near-infrared (NIR) to ultraviolet (UV).
We derive total to selective extinction ratios based on the Cardelli, Clayton
and Mathis (1989, CCM) law, which is typically used to fit the extinction data
both for diffuse and dense interstellar medium. We conclude that the CCM law is
able to fit most of the extinction curves in our sample. We divide the
remaining lines of sight with peculiar extinction into two groups according to
two main behaviors: a) the optical/IR or/and UV wavelength region cannot be
reproduced by the CCM formula; b) the optical/NIR and UV extinction data are
best fit by the CCM law with different values of R_V. We present examples of
such curves. The study of both types of peculiar cases can help us to learn
about the physical processes that affect dust in the interstellar medium, e.g.,
formation of mantles on the surface of grains, evaporation, growing or
shattering.",2005-02-23T13:04:48Z
Evolution of Binary Supermassive Black Holes via Chain Regularization,"A chain regularization method is combined with special purpose computer
hardware to study the evolution of massive black hole binaries at the centers
of galaxies. Preliminary results with up to N=260,000 particles are presented.
The decay rate of the binary is shown to decrease with increasing N, as
expected on the basis of theoretical arguments. The eccentricity of the binary
remains small.",2005-02-09T18:04:11Z
HT Camelopardalis: The simplest intermediate polar spin pulse,"The intermediate polar HT Cam is unusual in that it shows no evidence for
dense absorption in its spectrum. We analyse an XMM-Newton observation of this
star, which confirms the absence of absorption and shows that the X-ray
spin-pulse is energy independent. The modulation arises solely from occultation
effects and can be reproduced by a simple geometrical model in which the lower
accretion footprint is fainter than the upper one.
  We suggest that the lack of opacity in the accretion columns of HT Cam, and
also of EX Hya and V1025 Cen, results from a low accretion rate owing to their
being below the cataclysmic variable period gap.",2005-03-23T09:34:36Z
"Chandra Study of X-Ray Point Sources in the Early-Type Galaxy NGC 4552
  (M89)","We present a Chandra ACIS study of the early-type galaxy NGC 4552. We detect
47 X-ray point sources, most of which are likely LMXBs, within 4 R_e. The
brightest X-ray source coincides with the optical/UV/radio center of the
galaxy, and shows variability on >1 hr timescales, indicating the possible
existence of a LLAGN. The 46 off-center sources and the unresolved point
sources contribute about 29% and 20% to the total luminosity of the galaxy,
respectively. The corrected cumulative XLF of the off-center sources is best
fit by a broken power-law model with a break at L_b=4.4+2.0-1.4 e38 ergs/s. We
identified 210 GCs candidates in a HST WFPC2 optical image of the galaxy's
central region. Of the 25 off-center LMXBs that fall within the WFPC2 FOV, 10
sources are coincident with a GC. Thus the fraction of the GCs hosting bright
LMXBs and the fraction of the LMXBs associated with GCs are 4.8% and 40%,
respectively. In the V and I bands, the GCs hosting bright LMXBs are typically
1-2 magnitudes brighter than the GCs with no detected LMXBs. There are about
1.9+-0.4 times as many LMXBs in the red, metal-rich GCs as there are in the
blue, metal-poor ones. We find no obvious difference between the luminosity
distributions of LMXBs in GCs and in field, but the cumulative spectrum of the
LMXBs in GCs tends to be softer than that of the LMXBs in field. We detected 3
X-ray sources that have isotropic luminosities larger than 1e39 erg/s. The one
located in the joint Chandra-HST field is found to be associated with a GC. By
studying the ACIS spectra we infer that the this may be a candidate black hole
system with a mass of 15-135 M_sun. One of the other sources with a luminosity
brighter than 1e39 ergs/s reveals temporal variations in brightness on
timescales greater than an hour.",2005-06-12T08:31:10Z
"Formation of Resonant Atomic Lines during Thermonuclear Flashes on
  Neutron Stars","Motivated by the measurement of redshifted Fe H$\alpha$ lines during type I
X-ray bursts on EXO 0748-676 (Cottam, Paerels & Mendez), we study the formation
of atomic Fe lines above the photosphere of a bursting neutron star ($k_BT_{\rm
eff} \approx 1-2 {\rm keV}$). We discuss the effects of Stark broadening,
resonant scattering and NLTE (level population) on the formation of hydrogenic
Fe H$\alpha$, Ly$\alpha$ and P$\alpha$ lines. From the observed equivalent
width of the Fe H$\alpha$ line, we find an implied Fe column of $1-3 \times
10^{20} {\rm cm}^{-2}$, which is 3-10 times larger than the Fe column
calculated from the accretion/spallation model of Bildsten, Chang & Paerels. We
also estimate that the implied Fe column is about a factor of 2-3 larger than a
uniform solar metallicity atmosphere. We discuss the effects of rotational
broadening and find that the rotation rate of \EXO must be slow, as confirmed
by the recent measurement of a 45 Hz burst oscillation by Villarreal &
Strohmayer. We also show that the Fe Ly$\alpha$ EW $\approx$ 15-20 eV
(redshifted 11-15 eV) and the P$\alpha$ EW $\approx$ 4-7 eV (redshifted 3-5 eV)
when the H$\alpha$ EW is 10 eV (redshifted 8 eV). The Ly$\alpha$ line is
rotationally broadened to a depth of $\approx 10%$, making it difficult to
observe with {\it Chandra}. We also show that radiative levitation can likely
support the Fe column needed to explain the line.",2005-05-03T19:40:12Z
"A Chandra X-ray Investigation of the Violent Interstellar Medium: From
  Dwarf Starbursts to Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies","We have analyzed observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory of the
diffuse emission by hot gas in 7 dwarf starburst galaxies, 6 edge-on starburst
galaxies, and 9 Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxies. These systems cover ranges of
\~ 10^4 in X-ray luminosity and several thousand in star formation rate and
K-band luminosity (a proxy for stellar mass). Despite this range in fundamental
parameters, we find that the properties of the diffuse X-ray emission are very
similar in all three classes of starburst galaxies. The spectrum of the diffuse
emission is well fit by thermal emission from gas with kT ~ 0.25 to 0.8 keV and
with several-times-solar abundance ratios of alpha elements to Fe. The ratio of
the thermal X-ray to far-infrared luminosity is roughly constant, as is the
characteristic surface brightness of the diffuse X-ray emission. The size of
the diffuse X-ray source increases systematically with both far-infrared and
K-Band luminosity. All three classes show strong morphological relationships
between the regions of hot gas probed by the diffuse X-ray emission and the
warm gas probed by optical line emission. These findings suggest that the same
physical mechanism is producing the diffuse X-ray emission in the three types
of starbursts, and are consistent with that mechanism being shocks driven by a
galactic ""superwind'' powered by the kinetic energy collectively supplied by
stellar winds and supernovae in the starburst.",2005-03-31T03:50:16Z
"Identification of the optical counterparts of high-mass X-ray binaries
  through optical photometry and spectroscopy","We present the results of our search for optical counterparts to high-mass
X-ray transient sources discovered by various X-ray missions. We obtained CCD
images of the X-ray fields through BVR and Halpha filters in order to identify
early-type stars in the R-Halpha versus B-V colour-colour diagram. We also
obtained medium-resolution spectroscopy of the candidates in order to confirm
the presence of H\alpha emission and perform spectral classification. We report
on the discovery of the optical counterparts to two X-ray sources: XTE
J1858+034 and IGR J01363+6610, and the follow-up observations of another two,
newly identified by our group: SAX J2103.5+4545 and GRO J2058+42. For another
source, IGR J00370+6122, we present the first detailed optical spectral
analysis. The optical photometry and spectroscopy reveal B-type companions in
all five sources; GRO J2058+42, SAX J2103.5+4545 and IGR J01363+6610 are
positively identified with Be/X-ray binaries, IGR J00370+6122 with a supergiant
X-ray binary, while the nature of XTE J1858+034 is uncertain. We also study the
relationship between the optical and X-ray emission during quiescent states.",2005-05-16T12:09:23Z
Bounds on Cosmic Strings from WMAP and SDSS,"We find the constraints from WMAP and SDSS data on the fraction of
cosmological fluctuations sourced by local cosmic strings using a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. In addition to varying the usual 6 cosmological
parameters and the string tension ($\mu$), we also varied the amount of
small-scale structure on the strings. Our results indicate that cosmic strings
can account for up to 7 (14)% of the total power of the microwave anisotropy at
68 (95)% confidence level. The corresponding bound on the string mass per unit
length, within our string model, is $G\mu < 1.8 (2.7) \times 10^{-7}$ at 68

following the correction of errors in our cosmic string code outlined in a
recent erratum, astro-ph/0604141. We also calculate the B-type polarization
spectra sourced by cosmic strings and discuss the prospects of their detection.",2005-03-16T18:30:30Z
"Young, Jupiter-Mass Objects in Ophiuchus","We have used 3.5 to 8 micron data from the Cores to Disks (c2d) Legacy survey
and our own deep IJHKs images of a 0.5 square degree portion of the c2d fields
in Ophiuchus to produce a sample of candidate young objects with probable
masses between 1 and 10 Jupiter masses. The availability of photometry over
whole range where these objects emit allows us to discriminate between young,
extremely low-mass candidates and more massive foreground and background
objects and means our survey will have fewer false positives than existing
near-IR surveys. The sensitive inventory of a star forming cloud from the red
to the mid-IR will allow us to constrain the IMF for these non-clustered star
formation regions to well below the deuterium burning limit. For stars with
fluxes in the broad gap between the 2MASS limits and our limits, our data will
provide information about the photospheres. We will use the Spitzer results in
combination with current disk models to learn about the presence and nature of
circumstellar disks around young brown dwarfs.",2005-06-03T15:52:29Z
Metals in Star-Forming Galaxies at High Redshift,"The chemical composition of high-redshift galaxies is an important property
that gives clues to their past history and future evolution. Measuring
abundances in distant galaxies with current techniques is often a challenge,
and the canonical metallicity indicators can often not be applied. I discuss
currently available metallicity indicators based on stellar and interstellar
absorption and emission lines, and assess their limitations and systematic
uncertainties. Recent studies suggest that star-forming galaxies at redshift
around 3 have heavy-element abundances already close to solar, in agreement
with predictions from cosmological models.",2005-06-13T18:28:12Z
"The response of primordial abundances to a general modification of
  $G_{\rm N}$ and/or of the early universe expansion rate","We discuss the effects of a possible time variation of the Newton constant
$G_{\rm N}$ on light elements production in Big Bang Nucleosyntesis (BBN). We
provide analytical estimates for the dependence of primordial abundances on the
value of the Newton constant during BBN. The accuracy of these estimates is
then tested by numerical methods. % Moreover, we determine numerically the
response of each element to an arbitrary time-dependent modification of the
early universe expansion rate. Finally, we determine the bounds on possible
variations of $G_{\rm N}$ which can be obtained from the comparison of
theoretical predictions and observational data.",2005-03-23T17:37:28Z
"Effect of entrainment on stress and pulsar glitches in neutron star
  crust","The build up of the stress whose relaxation is presumed to account for pulsar
frequency glitches can be attributed to various mechanisms, of which the most
efficient involve differential rotation of the neutron superfluid in the inner
layers of the (magnetically braked) solid crust of a rotating neutron star. In
such a case it is usually supposed that the stress is attributable to pinning
of superfluid vortices to crust nuclei, but it has been suggested that, even if
the pinning effect is too weak, a comparably large stress might still arise
just from the deficit of centrifugal buoyancy in the slowed down crust. The
present work is a re-examination that investigates the way such processes may
be affected by considerations that were overlooked in the previous work --
notably uncertainties about the ``effective'' masses that have to be attributed
to the ``free'' superfluid neutrons to allow for their entrainment by the ionic
crust material. Though restricted to a Newtonian formulation, this analysis
distinguishes more carefully than has been usual between true velocities, which
are contravariantly vectorial, and so called ``superfluid velocities'' that are
proportional to momenta, which are essentially covectorial, a technicality that
is important when more than one independent current is involved. The results
include a Proudman type theorem to the effect that the superfluid angular
velocity must be constant on slightly deformed Taylor cylinders in the force
free case, and it is shown how to construct a pair of integral constants of the
motion that determine the solution for the pinned case assuming beta
equilibrium.",2005-03-02T15:36:37Z
"Neutrinos as a diagnostic of cosmic ray Galactic/extra-galactic
  transition","Motivated by a recent change in viewing the onset of the extra-galactic
component in the cosmic ray spectrum, we have fitted the observed data down to
$10^{8.6}$ GeV and have obtained the corresponding power emissivity. This
transition energy is well below the threshold for resonant $p\gamma$ absorption
on the cosmic microwave background, and thus source evolution is an essential
ingredient in the fitting procedure. Two-parameter fits in the spectral and
redshift evolution indices show that a standard Fermi $E_i^{-2}$ source
spectrum is excluded at larger than 95% confidence level (CL). Armed with the
primordial emissivity, we follow Waxman and Bahcall to derive the associated
neutrino flux on the basis of optically thin sources. For $pp$ interactions as
the generating mechanism, the neutrino flux exceeds the AMANDA-B10 90%CL upper
limits. In the case of $p\gamma$ dominance, the flux is marginally consistent
with AMANDA-B10 data. In the new scenario the source neutrino flux dominates
over the cosmogenic flux at all energies. Thus, should data from AMANDA-II
prove consistent with the model, we show that IceCube can measure the
characteristic power law of the neutrino spectrum, and thus provide a window on
the source dynamics.",2005-03-10T20:03:29Z
X-ray Bright QSO's around NGC 3079,"NGC 3079 is a very active, disturbed galaxy which has been observed to have
X-ray and radio ejections from it as well as an optical superbubble along its
minor axis. Here we show that the brightest X-ray sources within about 40
arcmin are in large excess of background values. The X-ray sources are
identified as quasars and AGN's which are aligned and spaced across the Seyfert
nucleus to a degree which is unlikely to be due to chance. The famous double
quasar which has been interpreted as a gravitational lens is discussed in terms
of the the X - ray and ULX sources which appear associated with NGC 3079.",2005-04-11T11:50:11Z
On Precision Measurement of the Mean Curvature,"Very small mean curvature is a robust prediction of inflation worth rigorous
checking. Since current constraints are derived from determinations of the
angular-diameter distance to the CMB last-scattering surface, which is also
affected by dark energy, they are limited by our understanding of the dark
energy. Measurements of luminosity or angular-diameter distances to redshifts
in the matter-dominated era can greatly reduce this uncertainty. With a one
percent measurement of the distance to z=3, combined with the CMB data expected
from Planck, one can achieve sigma(\Omega_k h^2) \sim 10^{-3}. A non-zero
detection at this level would be evidence against inflation or for unusually
large curvature fluctuations on super-Hubble scales.",2005-03-18T00:55:03Z
"On the relationship between auroral and nebular oxygen line intensities
  in spectra of HII regions","We investigate relationships between observed auroral and nebular oxygen line
fluxes in spectra of HII regions. We find a relation that is
metallicity-dependent at low metallicities, but becomes independent of
metallicity (within the uncertainties of the available data) above 12+logO/H ~
8.25, i.e. there is one-to-one correspondance (the ff - relation) between
auroral and nebular oxygen line fluxes in spectra of high-metallicity HII
regions. The ff - relation allows one to estimate the flux in the auroral line
from strong oxygen line measurements. This solves the problem of the electron
temperature (and, consequently, abundance) determination in high-metallicity
HII regions. The ff - relation confirms the basic idea of the empirical method,
proposed by Pagel et al. (1979) a qurter of a century ago, that the oxygen
abundance in HII region can be estimated from the strong oxygen lines
measurements only.",2005-04-18T11:10:20Z
"Co-existence of Gravity and Antigravity: The Unification of Dark Matter
  and Dark Energy","Massive gravity with second and fourth derivatives is shown to give both
attractive and repulsive gravities. In contrast to the attractive gravity
correlated with the energy-momentum tensor, the repulsive gravity is related to
a fixed mass $m_x$, which equals a spin-dependent factor $f_\sigma$ times the
graviton mass. Therefore, particles with energy below $m_x$ are both dark
matter and dark energy: Their overall gravity is attractive with normal matter
but repulsive among themselves. Detailed analyses reveal that this unified dark
scenario can properly account for the observed dark matter/energy phenomena:
galaxy rotation curves, transition from early cosmic deceleration to recent
acceleration; and naturally overcome other dark scenarios' difficulties: the
substructure and cuspy core problems, the difference of dark halo distributions
in galaxies and clusters, and the cosmic coincidence. Very interestingly, Dirac
particles have $f_\sigma=1/\sqrt 2$, all bosonic matter particles have
$f_\sigma=0$, and the only exceptional boson is the graviton itself, which may
have $f_\sigma>1$.",2005-06-03T02:33:29Z
A Remarkable Low-Mass X-ray Binary within 0.1 pc of the Galactic Center,"Recent X-ray and radio observations have identified a transient low-mass
X-ray binary (LMXB) located only 0.1 pc in projection from the Galactic center,
CXOGC J174540.0-290031. In this paper, we report the detailed analysis of X-ray
and infrared observations of the transient and its surroundings. Chandra
bservations detect the source at a flux of F_X = 2e-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (2-8
keV). After accounting for absorption both in the interstellar medium and in
material local to the source, the implied luminosity of the source is only L_X
= 4e34 erg/s (2-8 keV; D=8 kpc). However, the diffuse X-ray emission near the
source also brightened by a factor of 2. The enhanced diffuse X-ray emission
lies on top of a known ridge of dust and ionized gas that is visible infrared
images. We interpret the X-ray emission as scattered flux from the outburst,
and determine that the peak luminosity of CXOGC J174540.0-290031 was >2e36
erg/s. We suggest that the relatively small observed flux results from the fact
that the system is observed nearly edge-on, so that the accretion disk
intercepts most of the flux emitted along our line of sight. We compare the
inferred peak X-ray luminosity to that of the radio jet. The ratio of the X-ray
to radio luminosities, L_X/L_R<1e4, is considerably smaller than in other known
LMXBs (> 1e5). This is probably because the jets are radiating with unusually
high efficiency at the point where they impact the surrounding interstellar
medium. This hypothesis is supported by a comparison with mid-infrared images
of the surrounding dust. Finally, we find that the minimum power required to
produce the jet, L_jet~1e37 erg/s, is comparable to the inferred peak X-ray
luminosity. This is the most direct evidence yet obtained that LMXBs accreting
at low rates release about half of their energy as jets.",2005-03-26T00:15:17Z
Non-linear X-ray variability in X-ray binaries and active galaxies,"We show that the rms-flux relation recently discovered in the X-ray light
curves of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries (XRBs) implies that
the light curves have a formally non-linear, exponential form, provided the
rms-flux relation applies to variations on all time-scales (as it appears to).
This phenomenological model implies that stationary data will have a lognormal
flux distribution. We confirm this result using an observation of Cyg X-1, and
further demonstrate that our model predicts the existence of the powerful
millisecond flares observed in Cyg X-1 in the low/hard state, and explains the
general shape and amplitude of the bicoherence spectrum in that source. Our
model predicts that the most variable light curves will show the most extreme
non-linearity. This result can naturally explain the apparent non-linear
variability observed in some highly variable Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1)
galaxies, as well as the low states observed on long time-scales in the NLS1
NGC 4051, as being nothing more than extreme manifestations of the same
variability process that is observed in XRBs and less variable AGN. That
variability process must be multiplicative (with variations coupled together on
all time-scales) and cannot be additive (such as shot-noise), or related to
self-organised criticality, or result from completely independent variations in
many separate emitting regions. Successful models for variability must
reproduce the observed rms-flux relation and non-linear behaviour, which are
more fundamental characteristics of the variability process than the power
spectrum or spectral-timing properties. Models where X-ray variability is
driven by accretion rate variations produced at different radii remain the most
promising.",2005-02-04T22:21:00Z
"Time Evolution of Relativistic Force-Free Fields Connecting a Neutron
  Star and its Disk","We study the magnetic interaction between a neutron star and its disk by
solving the time-dependent relativistic force-free equations. At the initial
state, we assume that the dipole magnetic field of the neutron star connects
the neutron star and its equatorial disk, which deeply enters into the
magnetosphere of the neutron star. Magnetic fields are assumed to be frozen to
the star and the disk. The rotation of the neutron star and the disk is imposed
as boundary conditions. We apply Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL) method to simulate
the evolution of the star-disk system. We carry out simulations for (1) a disk
inside the corotation radius, in which the disk rotates faster than the star,
and (2) a disk outside the corotation radius, in which the neutron star rotates
faster than the disk. Numerical results indicate that for both models, the
magnetic field lines connecting the disk and the star inflate as they are
twisted by the differential rotation between the disk and the star. When the
twist angle exceeds pi radian, the magnetic field lines expand with speed close
to the light speed. This mechanism can be the origin of relativistic outflows
observed in binaries containing a neutron star.",2005-02-18T09:44:38Z
Gravitational Lensing of stars in the central arcsecond of our Galaxy,"In the neighborhood of Sgr A*, several stars (S2, S12, S14, S1, S8, S13)
enjoy an accurate determination of their orbital parameters. General Relativity
predicts that the central black hole acts as a gravitational lens on these
stars, generating a secondary image and two infinite series of relativistic
images. For each of these six stars, we calculate the light curves for the
secondary and the first two relativistic images, in the Schwarzschild black
hole hypothesis, throughout their orbital periods. The curves are peaked around
the periapse epoch, but two subpeaks may arise in nearly edge-on orbits, when
the source is behind or in front of Sgr A*. We show that for most of these
stars the secondary image should be observable during its brightness peak. In
particular, S14 is the best candidate, since its secondary image reaches K=23.3
with an angular separation of 0.125 mas from the apparent horizon of the
central black hole. The detection of such images by future instruments could
represent the first observation of gravitational lensing beyond the weak field
approximation.",2005-03-30T15:33:15Z
"The Millennium Galaxy Catalogue: the space density and surface
  brightness distribution(s) of galaxies","We recover the joint and individual space density and surface brightness
distribution(s) of galaxies from the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue. The MGC is a
local survey spanning 30.9 sq deg and probing approximately one--two mag/sq
arcsec deeper than either the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS)
or the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The MGC contains 10,095 galaxies to
B_mgc < 20 mag with 96 per cent spectroscopic completeness. We implement a
joint luminosity-surface brightness step-wise maximum likelihood method to
recover the bivariate brightness distribution (BBD) inclusive of most selection
effects. Integrating the BBD over surface brightness we recover the following
Schechter function parameters: phi* = (0.0177 +/- 0.0015) h^3 Mpc^{-3}, M_{B}*
- 5 log h = (-19.60 +/- 0.04) mag and alpha =-1.13 +/- 0.02. Compared to the
2dFGRS (Norberg et al 2002) we find a consistent M* value but a slightly
flatter faint-end slope and a higher normalisation, resulting in a final
luminosity density j_{b_J} = (1.99 +/- 0.17) x 10^8 h L_{odot} Mpc^{-3}. The
MGC surface brightness distribution is a well bounded Gaussian at the M* point
with phi* = (3.5 +/- 0.1) x 10^{-2} h^3 Mpc^{-3}, mu^{e*} = (21.90 +/- 0.01)
mag/sq arcsec and sigma_{ln R_e} = 0.35 +/- 0.01. The characteristic surface
brightness for luminous systems is invariant to M_{B} - 5 log h ~ -19 mag
faintwards of which it moves to lower surface brightness. Higher resolution
(FWHM < 1 arcsec) and deeper (mu_eff > 26 mag/sq arcsec in the B-band)
observations of the local universe are now essential to probe to lower
luminosity and lower surface brightness levels. [abridged]",2005-03-09T23:43:12Z
"Galaxy-galaxy-galaxy lensing: Third-order correlations between the
  galaxy and mass distributions in the Universe","Galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) measures the 2-point cross-correlation between
galaxies and mass in the Universe. In this work we seek to generalise this
effect by considering the third-order correlations between galaxies and mass:
galaxy-galaxy-galaxy lensing. Third-order correlations in the cosmic shear
field have recently been reported in the VIRMOS-DESCART and CTIO surveys. Such
data should also be ideal for measuring galaxy-galaxy-galaxy lensing. Indeed,
the effects of these higher-order correlations may have already been detected
in recent studies of galaxy-galaxy lensing. In this paper we lay out the basic
relations for third-order cross correlations and their projections and
introduce a new set of scale dependent third-order bias parameters. We define
three new observables: two galaxy-shear-shear correlation functions, $G_{\pm}$,
and a galaxy-galaxy-shear correlation, ${\cal G}$. We relate these to the
various projected cross-bispectra and give practical estimators for their
measurement. We note that the observational signature of these correlators is
simply the excess shear-shear correlation measured about foreground galaxies
(for $G_{\pm}$) and the average tangential shear around foreground galaxy pairs
(for $\cal G$). Finally we derive expressions for the third order aperture mass
statistics in terms of both the cross-bispectra and the real-space correlation
functions. (Abridged)",2005-02-25T22:29:15Z
A new calibration of stellar parameters of Galactic O stars,"We present new calibrations of stellar parameters of O stars at solar
metallicity taking non-LTE, wind, and line-blanketing effects into account.
Gravities and absolute visual magnitudes are derived from results of recent
spectroscopic analyses. Two types of effective temperature scales are derived:
one from a compilation based on recent spectroscopic studies of a sample of
massive stars - the ``observational scale'' - and the other from direct
interpolations on a grid of non-LTE spherically extended line-blanketed models
computed with the code CMFGEN (Hillier & Miller 1998) - the ``theoretical
scale''. These Teff scales are then further used together with the grid of
models to calibrate other parameters (bolometric correction, luminosity,
radius, spectroscopic mass and ionising fluxes) as a function of spectral type
and luminosity class. Compared to the earlier calibrations of Vacca et al.
(1996) the main results are: 1) the effective temperature scales are cooler by
2000 to 8000 K, the reduction being the largest for early supergiants; 2)
bolometric corrections are lower by 0.1 mag for a given temperature, and are
lower by 0.3 - 0.6 mag for a given spectral type; 3) luminosities are reduced
by 0.20 to 0.35 dex; 4) Lyman ionising fluxes are lower by 0.20 to 0.80 dex. We
provide calibration tables for each luminosity class and for both types of Teff
scales.",2005-03-16T15:14:50Z
"Millimetre continuum observations of southern massive star formation
  regions. I. SIMBA observations of cold cores","We report the results of a SEST 1.2 mm continuum emission survey toward
regions previously identified as harbouring a methanol maser and/or an UC HII
region, typically indicative of massive star formation. Emission is detected
toward all of the methanol maser and UC HII regions targeted, implying that
these objescts are associated with cold, deeply embedded objects.
  We have also identified a large number (253) of sources within the SIMBA
maps, which are devoid of maser and radio continuum emission. These `mm-only'
cores may be an entirely new class of source that represents an earlier stage
in the evolution of massive stars, prior to the onset of methanol maser
emission. Or, they may harbour protoclusters, which do not contain any high
mass stars (i.e. below the HII). Alternatively, they may represent a
cross-section of both, where the more massive mm-only cores are a precursor to
the methanol maser and the least massive mm-only cores will form intermediate
mass stars.
  Analysis of the mm-only sources shows that they are less massive ({\= M} =
0.9 x 10^{3} Msun), and smaller ({\= R} = 0.4 pc) than sources with methanol
maser and/or radio continuum emission, which collectively have a mean mass of
2.5 x 10^{3} Msun and a mean radius of 0.7 pc.",2005-06-17T03:21:37Z
A comparative analysis of empirical calibrators for nebular metallicity,"We present a new analysis of the main empirical calibrators of oxygen
abundance for ionised gas nebulae. With that aim we have compiled an extensive
sample of objects with emission line data including the near IR [SIII] lines
and the weak auroral lines which allow for the determination of the gas
electron temperature. For all the objects the oxygen abundances have been
derived in a homogeneus way, using the most recent sets of atomic coefficients
and taking into the account the effect of particle density on the temperature
of O$^+$. The residuals between directly and empirically-derived abundances as
a function of abundance have been studied. A grid of photo-ionisation models,
covering the range of physical properties of the gas, has been used to explain
the origin of the uncertainties affecting each abundance calibrator. The range
of validity for each abundance parameter has been identified and its average
uncertainty has been quantified.",2005-06-15T15:14:47Z
"Weibel Instability Driven by Relativistic Pair Jets: Particle
  Acceleration, Magnetic Field Generation, and Emission","Shock acceleration is a ubiquitous phenomenon in astrophysical plasmas.
Plasma waves and their associated instabilities (e.g., Buneman, Weibel and
other two-stream instabilities) created in collisionless shocks are responsible
for particle (electron, positron, and ion) acceleration. Using a 3-D
relativistic electromagnetic particle (REMP) code, we have investigated
particle acceleration associated with a relativistic jet front propagating into
an ambient plasma. We find that the growth times of the Weibel instability in
electron-positron jets are not affected by the (electron-positron or
electron-ion) ambient plasmas. However, the amplitudes of generated local
magnetic fields in the electron-ion ambient plasma are significantly larger
than those in the electron-positron ambient plasma.",2005-03-23T21:41:50Z
"[O I] 6300A emission in Herbig Ae/Be systems: signature of Keplerian
  rotation","We present high spectral-resolution optical spectra of 49 Herbig Ae/Be stars
in a search for the [O I] 6300A line. The vast majority of the stars in our
sample show narrow (FWHM < 100 km/s) emission lines, centered on the stellar
radial velocity. In only three sources is the feature much broader (~400 km/s),
and strongly blueshifted (-200 km/s) compared to the stellar radial velocity.
Some stars in our sample show double-peaked lines profiles, with peak-to-peak
separations of ~10 km/s. The presence and strength of the [O I] line emission
appears to be correlated with the far-infrared energy distribution of each
source: stars with a strong excess at 60 micron have in general stronger [O I]
emission than stars with weaker 60 micron excesses. We interpret these narrow
[O I] 6300A line profiles as arising in the surface layers of the
protoplanetary disks surrounding Herbig Ae/Be stars. A simple model for [O I]
6300A line emission due to the photodissociation of OH molecules shows that our
results are in quantitative agreement with that expected from the emission of a
flared disk if the fractional OH abundance is ~5 x 10^{-7}.",2005-02-24T12:22:16Z
On the Dayside Thermal Emission of Hot Jupiters,"We discuss atmosphere models of HD209458b in light of the recent day-side
flux measurement of HD209458b's secondary eclipse by Spitzer-MIPS at 24
microns. In addition, we present a revised secondary eclipse IRTF upper limit
at 2.2 microns which places a stringent constraint on the adjacent H2O
absorption band depths. These two measurements are complementary because they
are both shaped by H2O absorption and because the former is on the Wien tail of
the planet's thermal emission spectrum and the latter is near the thermal
emission peak. A wide range of models fit the observational data, confirming
our basic understanding of hot Jupiter atmospheric physics. Although a range of
models are viable, some models at the hot and cold end of the plausible
temperature range can be ruled out. One class of previously unconsidered hot
Jupiter atmospheric models that fit the data are those with C/O >~ 1 (as
Jupiter may have), which have a significant paucity of H2O compared to solar
abundance models with C/O = 0.5. The models indicate that HD209458b is in a
situation intermediate between pure in situ reradiation and very efficient
redistribution of heat; one which will require a careful treatment of
atmospheric circulation. We discuss how future wavelength-dependent and
phase-dependent observations will further constrain the atmospheric circulation
regime. In the shorter term, additional planned measurements for HD209458b,
especially Spitzer IRAC photometry, should lift many of the model degeneracies.
Multiwavelength IR observations constrain the atmospheric structure and
circulation properties of hot Jupiters and thus open a new chapter in
quantitative extrasolar planetology.",2005-04-08T17:03:19Z
The star formation history of the LSB Galaxy UGC 5889,"We present HST photometry of the LSB galaxy UGC 5889 and derive its recent
star formation history. In the last 200 Myr the star formation proceeded in
modest bursts at a rate of the order of e-2 to e-3 solar masses masses per
year, with periods of extremely low SFR or even quiescence. The rate derived
from the present study for the last 20 Myr is in agreement with the Halpha
emission from the galaxy. The presence of a consistent population older than
200 Myr is suggested by the data. However, observational errors and
completeness correction prevent any firm conclusion on the oldest age. The
total mass of stars is of the order of 5.5e7 solas masses. Even if the recent
episodes of star formation have heated the gas and carved a hole in the disk,
blow-away of the gas is unlikely to occur.",2005-02-17T17:54:24Z
An atlas of Calcium triplet spectra of active galaxies,"We present a spectroscopic atlas of active galactic nuclei covering the
region around the 8498, 8542, 8662 Calcium triplet (CaT) lines. The sample
comprises 78 objects, divided into 43 Seyfert 2s, 26 Seyfert 1s, 3 Starburst
and 6 normal galaxies. The spectra pertain to the inner ~300 pc in radius, and
thus sample the central kinematics and stellar populations of active galaxies.
The data are used to measure stellar velocity dispersions (sigma_star) both
with cross-correlation and direct fitting methods. These measurements are found
to be in good agreement with each-other and with those in previous studies for
objects in common. The CaT equivalent width is also measured. We find average
values and sample dispersions of W_CaT of 4.6+/-2.0, 7.0 and 7.7+/-1.0
angstrons for Seyfert 1s, Seyfert 2s and normal galaxies, respectively. We
further present an atlas of [SIII]\lambda 9069 emission line profiles for a
subset of 40 galaxies. These data are analyzed in a companion paper which
addresses the connection between stellar and Narrow Line Region kinematics, the
behaviour of the CaT equivalent width as a function of sigma_star, activity
type and stellar population properties.",2005-02-23T11:06:02Z
The Complex Star Formation History of NGC 1569,"We present new results on the star formation history of the dwarf irregular
galaxy NGC 1569. The data were obtained with Hubble Space Telescope's
NICMOS/NIC2 in the F110W (J) and F160W (H) near-infrared (NIR) filters and
interpreted with the synthetic color-magnitude diagram method. The galaxy
experienced a complex star formation (SF) activity. The best fit to the data is
found by assuming three episodes of activity in the last 1-2 Gyr. The most
recent and strong episode constrained by these NIR data started ~37 Myr ago and
ended ~13 Myr ago, although we cannot exclude the possibility that up to three
SF episodes occurred in this time interval. The average star-formation rate
(SFR) of the episode is 3.2 Msun yr-1 kpc-2, in agreement with literature data.
A previous episode produced stars between 150 Myr and 40 Myr ago, with a mean
SFR about 2/3 lower than the mean SFR of the youngest episode. An older SF
episode occurred about 1 Gyr ago. All these SFRs are 2-3 orders of magnitude
higher than those derived for late-type dwarfs of the Local Group. In all cases
an initial mass function similar to Salpeter's allows for a good reproduction
of the data, but we cannot exclude flatter mass functions. These results have
been obtained adopting a distance of 2.2 Mpc and a reddening E(B-V)=0.56. A
larger distance would require younger episodes and higher SFRs. We have
explored some possible scenarios using the astrated mass in the best fit model,
in order to constrain the past star formation history. We cannot rule out a low
rate in the past SF but we can safely conclude that the last 1-2 Gyr have been
peculiar.",2005-04-12T20:00:36Z
"Comment on the paper of Jaffe et al (astro-ph/0503213) on evidence of

vorticity and shear of the Universe are incorrect. They fit WMAP data with
certain Bianchi model which is known to have a vanishing vorticity. The
performed fit of the shear is not reliable because the respective formula seems
not to be gauge invariant. We suggest a theoretical framework to analyze
asymmetric large scale WMAP data.",2005-03-25T16:43:44Z
"Stochastic Electron Acceleration During the NIR and X-ray Flares in
  Sagittarius A*","Recent near-IR (NIR) and X-ray observations of Sagittarius A*'s spectrum have
yielded several strong constraints on the transient energization mechanism,
justifying a re-examination of the stochastic acceleration model proposed
previously for these events. We here demonstrate that the new results are fully
consistent with the acceleration of electrons via the transit-time damping
process. But more importantly, these new NIR and X-ray flares now can constrain
the source size, the gas density, the magnetic field, and the wave energy
density in the turbulent plasma. Future simultaneous multi-wavelength
observations with good spectral information will, in addition, allow us to
study their temporal evolution, which will eventually lead to an accurate
determination of the behavior of the plasma just minutes prior to its
absorption by the black hole.",2005-06-07T20:32:35Z
Second Order Geodesic Corrections to Cosmic Shear,"We consider the impact of second order corrections to the geodesic equation
governing gravitational lensing. We start from the full second order metric,
including scalar, vector and tensor perturbations, and retain all relevant
contributions to the cosmic shear corrections that are second order in the
gravitational potential. The relevant terms are: the nonlinear evolution of the
scalar gravitational potential, the Born correction, and lens-lens coupling. No
other second order terms contribute appreciably to the lensing signal. Since
ray-tracing algorithims currently include these three effects, this derivation
serves as rigorous justification for the numerical predictions.",2005-03-07T20:16:23Z
The cosmological simulation code GADGET-2,"We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively
parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the
N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics
(SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in
regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing
lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole
expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm,
where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree'-method while
long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is
based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can
be integrated with different timesteps. Individual and adaptive short-range
timesteps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the
parallelisation algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high
flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are
cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required
communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological
N-body simulation with more than 10^10 dark matter particles, reaching a
homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 10^5 per dimension in a 3D box. It has
also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that
account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle
numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code
and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems.
GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.",2005-05-02T18:09:59Z
Multi-phase High-Velocity Clouds toward HE 0226-4110 and PG 0953+414,"We study the physical conditions, elemental abundances, and kinematics of the
high-velocity clouds (HVCs) along the sight lines toward active galaxies
HE0226-4110 and PG0953+414 using Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph
and Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer data. Our observations reveal
multiple components of HVC absorption in lines of HI, CII, CIII, CIV, OVI,
SiII, SiIII, and SiIV in both directions. We investigate whether
photoionization by the extragalactic background radiation or by escaping Milky
Way radiation can explain the observed ionization pattern. We find that
photoionization is a good explanation for the CII, CIII, SiII, and SiIII
features, but not for the OVI or CIV associated with the HVCs, suggesting that
two principal phases exist: a warm (T~10^4K), photoionized phase and a hotter
(T=1-3x10^5K), collisionally-ionized phase. The warm HVCs toward HE0226-4110
have high levels of ionization (97-99%), and metallicities ([Z/H] between -0.9
and -0.4) close to those in the Magellanic Stream, which lies eleven degrees
away on the sky at similar velocities. These HVCs have thermal pressures that
would place them close to equilibrium in a fully ionized 10^6 K Galactic corona
with n_H=4-9x10^{-5}cm^{-3} at 50 kpc. A mini-survey of the hot, collisionally
ionized HVC components seen here and in five other sight lines finds that in
11/12 cases, the high ions have kinematics and ionic ratios that are consistent
with an origin in conductive interfaces. However, the broad absorption wing on
the OVI profile toward PG0953+414 is not completely explained by the interface
scenario, and may be tracing the outflow of hot gas into the Milky Way halo as
part of a Galactic fountain or wind.",2005-05-13T20:00:32Z
The Discovery of Spiral Arms in the Starburst Galaxy M82,"We report the discovery of two symmetric spiral arms in the near-infrared
(NIR) images of the starburst galaxy M82. The spiral arms are recovered when an
axi-symmetric exponential disk is subtracted from the NIR images. The arms
emerge from the ends of the NIR bar and can be traced up to three disk
scalelengths. The winding of the arms is consistent with an m=2 logarithmic
spiral mode of pitch angle 14 degrees. The arms are bluer than the disk in
spite of their detection on the NIR images. If the northern side of the galaxy
is nearer to us, as is normally assumed, the observed sense of rotation implies
trailing arms. The nearly edge-on orientation, high disk surface brightness,
and the presence of a complex network of dusty filaments in the optical images,
are responsible for the lack of detection of the arms in previous studies.",2005-06-13T15:34:25Z
"The Ionized Gas and Nuclear Environment in NGC 3783 V. Variability and
  Modeling of the Intrinsic Ultraviolet Absorption","We present results on the location, physical conditions, and geometry of the
outflow in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783 from a study of the variable intrinsic
UV absorption. Based on 18 observations with HST/STIS and 6 observations with
FUSE, we find: 1) The absorption from the lowest-ionization species in each of
the three strong kinematic components varied inversely with the continuum flux,
indicating the ionization structure responded to changes in the photoionizing
flux over the weekly timescales sampled by our observations. 2) A multi-
component model with an unocculted NLR and separate BLR and continuum
line-of-sight covering factors predicts saturation in several lines, consistent
with the lack of observed variability. 3) Column densities for the individual
metastable levels are measured from the resolved C III *1175 absorption complex
observed in one component. Based on our computed metastable level populations,
the electron density of this absorber is ~3x10^4 cm^-3. Photoionization
modeling results place it at ~25 pc from the central source. 4) Using
time-dependent calculations, we are able to reproduce the detailed variability
observed in this absorber, and derive upper limits on the distances for the
other components of 25-50 pc. 5) The ionization parameters derived for the
higher ionization UV absorbers are consistent with the modeling results for the
lowest-ionization X-ray component, but with smaller total column density. They
have similar pressures as the three X-ray ionization components. These results
are consistent with an inhomogeneous wind model for the outflow in NGC 3783. 6)
Based on the predicted emission-line luminosities, global covering factor
constraints, and distances derived for the UV absorbers, they may be identified
with emission- line gas observed in the inner NLR of AGNs. (abridged)",2005-06-14T20:13:11Z
"The enigmatic B[e]-star Henize 2-90: The non-spherical mass loss history
  from an analysis of forbidden lines","(abridged) We study the optical spectrum of the exciting B[e] star Hen 2-90
based on new high-resolution observations that cover the innermost 2"". Our
investigation is splitted in two parts, a qualitative study of the presence of
the numerous emission lines and the classification of their line profiles which
indicate a circumstellar environment of high complexity, and a quantitative
analysis of numerous forbidden lines, e.g. [OI], [OII], [OIII], [SII], [SIII],
[ArIII], [ClII], [ClIII] and [NII]. We find a correlation between the different
ionization states of the elements and the velocities derived from the line
profiles: the highly ionized atoms have the highest outflow velocity while the
neutral lines have the lowest outflow velocity. The recent HST image of Hen
2-90 reveals a bipolar, highly ionized region, a neutral disk-like structure
and an intermediate region of moderate ionization. It seems that a
non-spherical stellar wind model is a good option to explain the ionization and
spatial distribution of the circumstellar material. We modelled the forbidden
lines under the assumption of a non-spherically symmetric wind based on the HST
image. We find that in order to fit the observed line luminosities, the mass
flux, surface temperature, and terminal wind velocities need to be latitude
dependent, which might be explained in terms of a rapidly rotating central
star. A rotation speed of 75-80 % of the critical velocity has been derived.
The total mass loss rate of the star was determined to be of order 3 10^{-5}
M_sun/yr. Such a wind scenario and the fact that compared to solar abundances
C, O, and N seem to be underabundant while S, Ar and Cl have solar abundances,
might be explained in terms of a rapidly rotating post-AGB star.",2005-05-10T17:10:39Z
NGC 4254: a spiral galaxy entering the Virgo cluster,"Deep Effelsberg HI spectra of the one-armed, bright Virgo cluster spiral
galaxy NGC 4254 are presented.Five different positions were observed in the 21
cm HI line with the Effelsberg 100-m telescope: one in the center and 4 located
one HPBW to the NE, NW, SW, and SE, respectively, from the galaxy center. The
spectra are compared to existing deep VLA observations, and the single dish and
interferometric HI data are used to constrain a dynamical model which includes
the effects of ram pressure. The peculiar, one-armed spiral pattern of NGC 4254
and its distorted and kinematically perturbed atomic gas distribution can be
explained by a close and rapid encounter ~280 Myr ago with another massive
Virgo galaxy, followed by ram pressure stripping that is still ongoing. The
stripping occurs almost face-on, since the angle between the disk and the
orbital plane is 70 degrees. The galaxy with which NGC 4254 had its encounter
is tentatively identified as the lenticular NGC 4262.",2005-05-02T13:50:23Z
On the kinematics of the neutron star low mass X-ray binary Cen X-4,"We present the first determination of the proper motion of the neutron star
low mass X-ray binary {Cen X-4} measured from relative astrometry of the
secondary star using optical images at different epochs. We determine the
Galactic space velocity components of the system and find them to be
significantly different from the mean values that characterize the kinematics
of stars belonging to the halo, and the thin and the thick disc of the Galaxy.
The high metallicity of the secondary star of the system rules out a halo
origin and indicates that the system probably originated in the Galactic disc.
A statistical analysis of the galactocentric motion revealed that this binary
moves in a highly eccentric ($e\simeq 0.85\pm0.1$) orbit with an inclination of
$\simeq 110^\circ$ to the Galactic plane. The large Galactic space velocity
components strongly support that a high natal kick as a result of a supernova
explosion could have propelled the system into such an orbit from a birth place
in the Galactic disc. The high Li abundance in the secondary, comparable to
that of stars in star forming regions and young stellar clusters like the
Pleiades, may suggest a relatively recent formation of the system. Following
the orbit backwards in time, we found that the system could have been in the
inner regions of the Galactic disc $\sim$100--200 Myr ago. The neutron star
might have formed at that moment. However, we cannot rule out the possibility
that the system formed at a much earlier time if a Li production mechanism
exists in this LMXB.",2005-02-22T13:23:58Z
Radio Photosphere and Mass-Loss Envelope of VY CMa,"We have used the VLA to detect emission from the supergiant VY CMa at radio
wavelengths and have constructed 3000-4500 K isothermal outer atmospheres
constrained by the data. These models produce a radio photosphere at 1.5-2
R_ast. An extrapolation of the model can account for the observed total
mass-loss rate of the star. We also present mid-infrared imaging of the
supergiant that suggests warm dust is extended in the same direction as the
near-infrared reflection nebula around VY CMa. The origin of the asymmetries in
the outflow remains an unsolved problem.",2005-02-28T19:24:56Z
Kaon condensation in the quark-meson coupling model and compact stars,"The properties of neutron stars constituted of a crust of hadrons and an
internal part of hadrons and kaon condensate are calculated within the
quark-meson-coupling model. We have considered stars with nucleons only in the
hadron phase and also stars with hyperons as well. The results are compared
with the ones obtained from the non-linear Walecka model for the hadronic
phase.",2005-06-09T09:38:55Z
"Diffusive convective overshoot in core He-burning intermediate mass
  stars. I: the LMC metallicity","We present detailed evolutionary calculations focused on the evolution of
intermediate mass stars with 3 Msun < M < 9 Msun of metallicity typical of the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), i.e. Z=0.008. We compare carefully the models
calculated by adopting a diffusive scheme for chemical mixing, in which nuclear
burning and mixing are self-consistently coupled, while the eddy velocities
beyond the formal convective core boundary are treated to decay exponentially,
and those calculated with the traditional instantaneous mixing approximation.
We find that: i) the physical and chemical behaviour of the models during the
H-burning phase is independent of the scheme used for the treatment of mixing
inside the CNO burning core; ii) the duration of the He-burning phase relative
to the MS phase is systematically longer in the diffusive models, due to a
slower redistribution of helium to the core from the outer layers; iii) the
fraction of time spent in the blue part of the clump, compared to the stay in
the red, is larger in the diffusive models. The differences described in points
ii) and iii) tend to vanish for M > Msun. In terms of the theoretical
interpretation of an open cluster stellar population, the differences
introduced by the use of a self-consistent scheme for mixing in the core with
adjacent exponential decay are relevant for ages in the range 80 Myr < t < 200
Myr. These results are robust, since they are insensitive to the choice of the
free-parameters regulating the extension of the extra-mixing region.",2005-05-13T09:24:23Z
Evolution of Low-Mass Population III Stars,"We present the evolutionary models of metal-free stars in the mass range from
0.8 to 1.2 Msun with up-to-date input physics. The evolution is followed to the
onset of hydrogen mixing into a convection, driven by the helium flash at red
giant or asymptotic giant branch phase.
  The models of mass M >= 0.9 Msun undergo the central hydrogen flash,
triggered by the carbon production due to the 3-alpha reactions.
  We find that the border of the off-center and central ignition of helium core
flash falls between 1.1 and 1.2 Msun; the models of mass M <= 1.1 Msun
experience the hydrogen mixing at the tip of red giant branch while the models
of M = 1.2 Msun during the helium shell flashes on the asymptotic giant branch.
  The equation of state for the Coulomb liquid region, where electron
conduction and radiation compete, is shown to be important since it affects the
thermal state in the helium core and influences the red giant branch evolution.
  It is also found that the non-resonant term of 3-alpha reactios plays an
important role, although it has negligible effect in the evolution of stars of
younger populations.
  We compare our models with the computations by several other sets of authors,
to confirm the good agreement except for one study which finds the helium
ignition much closer to the center with consequences important for subsequent
evolution.",2005-04-25T15:22:31Z
"Power spectrum and correlation function errors: Poisson vs. Gaussian
  shot noise","Poisson distributed shot noise is normally considered in the Gaussian limit
in cosmology. However, if the shot noise is large enough and the correlation
function/power spectrum conspires, the Gaussian approximation mis-estimates the
errors and their covariance significantly. The power spectrum, even for
initially Gaussian densities,acquires cross correlations which can be large,
while the change in the correlation function error matrix is diagonal except at
zero separation. Two and three dimensional power law correlation function and
power spectrum examples are given. These corrections appear to have a large
effect when applied to galaxy clusters, e.g. for SZ selected galaxy clusters in
2 dimensions. This can increase the error estimates for cosmological parameter
estimation and consequently affect survey strategies, as the corrections are
minimized for surveys which are deep and narrow rather than wide and shallow.
In addition, a rewriting of the error matrix for the power spectrum/correlation
function is given which eliminates most of the Bessel function dependence (in
two dimensions) and all of it (in three dimensions), which makes the
calculation of the error matrix more tractable. This applies even when the shot
noise is in the (usual) Gaussian limit.",2005-03-14T04:00:08Z
Automated Detection of Classical Novae with Neural Networks,"The POINT-AGAPE collaboration surveyed M31 with the primary goal of optical
detection of microlensing events, yet its data catalogue is also a prime source
of lightcurves of variable and transient objects, including classical novae
(CNe). A reliable means of identification, combined with a thorough survey of
the variable objects in M31, provides an excellent opportunity to locate and
study an entire galactic population of CNe. This paper presents a set of 440
neural networks, working in 44 committees, designed specifically to identify
fast CNe. The networks are developed using training sets consisting of
simulated novae and POINT-AGAPE lightcurves, in a novel variation on K-fold
cross-validation. They use the binned, normalised power spectra of the
lightcurves as input units. The networks successfully identify 9 of the 13
previously identified M31 CNe within their optimal working range (and 11 out of
13 if the network error bars are taken into account). They provide a catalogue
of 19 new candidate fast CNe, of which 4 are strongly favoured.",2005-04-11T11:14:10Z
A statistical study of 233 pulsar proper motions,"We present and analyse a catalogue of 233 pulsars with proper motion
measurements. The sample contains a wide variety of pulsars including recycled
objects and those associated with globular clusters or supernova remnants.
After taking the most precise proper motions for those pulsars for which
multiple measurements are available, the majority of the proper motions (58%)
are derived from pulsar timing methods, 41% using interferometers and the
remaining 1% using optical telescopes. Many of the 1-D and 2-D speeds
(referring to speeds measured in one coordinate only and the magnitudes of the
transverse velocities respectively) derived from these measurements are
somewhat lower than earlier estimates because of the use of the most recent
electron density model in determining pulsar distances. The mean 1-D speeds for
the normal and recycled pulsars are 152(10) and 54(6) km/s respectively. The
corresponding mean 2-D speeds are 246(22) and 87(13) km/s. PSRs B2011+38 and
B2224+64 have the highest inferred 2-D speeds of ~1600 km/s. We study the mean
speeds for different subsamples and find that, in general, they agree with
previous results. Applying a novel deconvolution technique to the sample of 73
pulsars with characteristic ages less than 3 Myr, we find the mean 3-D pulsar
birth velocity to be 400(40) km/s. The distribution of velocities is well
described by a Maxwellian distribution with 1-D rms sigma=265 km/s. There is no
evidence for a bimodal velocity distribution. The proper motions for PSRs
B1830-08 and B2334+61 are consistent with their proposed associations with the
supernova remnants W41 and G114.3+0.3 respectively.",2005-04-26T23:46:59Z
"Abundance Analyses of Field RV Tauri Stars, VI: An Extended Sample","An abundance analysis is presented and discussed for a sample of 14 RV Tauri
stars. The present abundance data and those from our previous papers and by
other workers are combined in an attempt to further understanding of the
dust-gas separation process which afflicts many RV Tauri variables. We propose
that a star's intrinsic (i.e., initial) metallicity is given by the
photospheric zinc abundance. Variables warmer that about 5000 K and with an
initial metallicity [Fe/H] $\geq$ $-$1 are affected by dust-gas separation.
Variables of all metallicities and cooler than about $T_{\rm eff} \simeq 5000$
K are unaffected by dust-gas separation. The RV Tauri variables show a spread
in their C abundances with the lower boundary of the points in the C versus Zn
plane falling close to the predicted trend for giants after the first
dredge-up. The upper boundary is inhabited by a few stars that are carbon-rich.
The O abundances in the mean follow the predicted trend from unevolved stars in
line with the expectation that photospheric O abundance is unaffected by the
first dredge-up. An evolutionary scenario involving mass loss by a first ascent
or early-AGB red giant, the primary star of a binary, is sketched.",2005-03-16T13:44:25Z
"Cosmography, Decelerating Past, and Cosmological Models: Learning the
  Bayesian Way","In this paper, using a significantly improved version of the
model-independent, cosmographic approach to cosmology (John, M. V. 2004, ApJ,
614, 1), we address an important question: Was there a decelerating past for
the universe? To answer this, the Bayes's probability theory is employed, which
is the most appropriate tool for quantifying our knowledge when it changes
through the acquisition of new data. The cosmographic approach helps to sort
out the models in which the universe was always accelerating from those in
which it decelerated for at least some time in the period of interest. Bayesian
model comparison technique is used to discriminate these rival hypotheses with
the aid of recent releases of supernova data. We also attempt to provide and
improve another example of Bayesian model comparison, performed between some
Friedmann models, using the same data. Our conclusion, which is consistent with
other approaches, is that the apparent magnitude-redshift data alone cannot
discriminate these competing hypotheses. We also argue that the lessons learnt
using Bayesian theory are extremely valuable to avoid frequent U-turns in
cosmology.",2005-06-13T18:12:54Z
"Interplanetary coronal mass ejection effect on the muon flux at sea
  level","We present the results of 720 hours of observations of transient solar events
at ground level, during the summer season 2005 (Souther Hemisphere). Data were
taken with the TUPI muon telescope, working at a high counting rate (up to 100
KHz) and always pointing on the IMF lines (45 degrees of pitch angle). An
anti-correlation among the arrival of keV protons (observed by EPAM detector
aboard the ACE spacecraft) and sudden depressions in the muon flux at sea level
have been observed. The phenomena is discussed in the context that they can be
considered as mini-Forbush, caused by a shielding effect of the passage of a
disturbance (shock and plasma) and may be a signature of interplanetary
manifestations of coronal mass ejections.",2005-06-13T21:44:49Z
Number ratios of young stellar objects in embedded clusters,"Embedded clusters usually contain young stellar objects in different
evolutionary stages. We investigate number ratios of objects in these classes
in the star-forming regions rho Ophiuchi, Serpens, Taurus, Chamaeleon I, NGC
7129, IC 1396A, and IC 348. They are compared to the temporal evolution of
young stars in numerical simulations of gravoturbulent fragmentation in order
to constrain the models and to possibly determine the evolutionary stage of the
clusters. It turns out that Serpens is the youngest, and IC 348 the most
evolved cluster, although the time when the observations are best represented
varies strongly depending on the model. Furthermore, we find an inverse
correlation of the star formation efficiency (SFE) of the models with the Mach
number. However, the observational SFE values cannot be reproduced by the
current isothermal models. This argues for models that take into account
protostellar feedback processes and/or the effects of magnetic fields.",2005-03-29T09:08:32Z
"Non-Gaussianity in Multi-field Stochastic Inflation with the Scaling
  Approximation","The statistics of multi-field inflation are investigated using the stochastic
approach. We analytically obtain the probability distribution function of
fields with the scaling approximation by extending the previous work by
Amendola. The non-Gaussian nature of the probability distribution function is
investigated decomposing the fields into the adiabatic and isocurvature
components. We find that the non-Gaussianity of the isocurvature component can
be large compared with that of the adiabatic component. The adiabatic and
isocurvature components may be correlated at nonlinear order in the skewness
and kurtosis even if uncorrelated at linear level.",2005-06-16T08:33:59Z
Quintessence models of Dark Energy with non-minimal coupling,"We explore quintessence models of dark energy which exhibit non-minimal
coupling between the dark matter and the dark energy components of the cosmic
fluid. The kind of coupling chosen is inspired in scalar-tensor theories of
gravity. We impose a suitable dynamics of the expansion allowing to derive
exact Friedmann-Robertson-Walker solutions once the coupling function is given
as input. Coupling functions that lead to self-interaction potentials of the
single and double exponential types are the target of the present
investigation. The stability and existence of the solutions is discussed in
some detail. The models are tested against the observational evidence.",2005-02-19T13:30:32Z
Ultracool dwarfs,"We present results of modeling of spectra of M-, L-, T-dwarfs. Theoretical
spectra are fitted to observed spectra to study the main parameters of the
low-mass objects beyond the bottom of Main Sequence. Application of ``lithium''
and ``deuterium'' tests for assessment of ultra-cool dwarfs are discussed.",2005-06-13T08:38:42Z
Constrained Cluster Parameters from Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Observations,"Near-future SZ surveys such as ACT, SPT, APEX, and Planck will find thousands
of galaxy clusters. Multi-frequency arcminute-resolution SZ observations can,
in principle, determine each cluster's gas temperature (T_e), bulk velocity
(v_pec), and optical depth (tau). However, the frequency bands and detector
sensitivity employed by upcoming surveys will generally not be sufficient to
disentangle the degeneracy between these three cluster parameters, even in the
absence of SZ signal contamination from point sources and imperfect primary
microwave background subtraction. Assuming contaminants can be removed, we find
that near-future SZ surveys will be able to constrain well two cluster gas
parameters that are linear combinations of tau*T_e, tau*v_z, and tau*T_e^2.
Because the SZ intensity shift is nearly a linear function of tau*T_e, tau*v_z,
and tau*T_e^2, a correspondence exists between the two effective gas parameters
that SZ surveys can constrain and simple line-of-sight integrals through the
three dimensional cluster. We illustrate the parameter constraints and
correspondence to line-of-sight integrals using 3D Nbody + hydro cluster
simulations and a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. We show that adding an
independent T_e measurement to upcoming SZ data breaks the parameter
degeneracy. The cluster effective velocity thus constrained is approximately
the optical-depth-weighted velocity integrated along the cluster line of sight.
A temperature prior with an error as large as 2 keV still gives bulk velocity
errors < 100 km/sec, even for a more typical cluster with an electron
temperature of 3 keV, for ACT-like SZ observations in the absence of signal
contamination. The Markov chain constraints on v_pec and tau are more
encouraging and likely more accurate than those obtained from Fisher matrices.",2005-04-12T17:39:05Z
A helium spread among the main sequence stars in NGC 2808,"We studied the color distribution of the main sequence of the Globular
Cluster NGC 2808, based on new deep HST-WFPC2 photometry of a field in the
uncrowded outskirts of the cluster. The color distribution of main sequence
stars is wider than expected for a single stellar population, given our
(carefully determined) measurement errors. About 20% of the sample stars are
much bluer than expected and are most plausibly explained as a population
having a much larger helium abundance than the bulk of the main sequence. We
estimate that the helium mass fraction of these stars is Y ~ 0.4. NGC 2808 may
have suffered self-enrichment, with different stellar populations born from the
ejecta of the intermediate mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of the
first generation. In addition to the Y=0.40 stars, roughly 30% of the stars
should have Y distributed between 0.26-0.29 while 50% have primordial Y, to
explain also the peculiar horizontal branch morphology. Three main stages of
star formation are identified, the first with primordial helium content Y ~
0.24, the second one born from the winds of the most massive AGBs of the first
stellar generation (6-7msun), having Y ~ 0.4, and a third one born from the
matter ejected from less massive AGBs (~ 3.5-4.5msun) with Y ~ 0.26-0.29. For a
long hiatus of time (several 10^7yr) between the second and third generation,
star formation might have been inhibited by the explosion of late Supernovae II
deriving from binary evolution.",2005-05-17T14:15:15Z
"Identifying Dark Matter Through the Constraints Imposed by Fourteen
  Astronomically Based 'Cosmic Constituents'","Mankind has not yet explained dark matter, the accelerating expansion of the
Universe, the 'knee' and 'ankle' of the cosmic ray energy spectrum graph, the
low star formation rates of low surface brightness (LSB) dwarf galaxies, the
ignition of hydrogen fusion reactions in the first generation stars or the
departing locations of earthbound high-energy cosmic ray protons. A new
research hypothesis has been developed by the author based upon finding
astronomically based 'cosmic constituents' of the Universe that may be created
or influenced by or have a special relationship with possible dark matter
candidates. A list of 14 relevant and plausible 'cosmic constituents' of the
Universe was developed by the author, which was then used to establish a list
of constraints regarding the nature and characteristics of the long-sought dark
matter particles. A dark matter candidate was then found that best conformed to
the 14 constraints established by the 'cosmic constituents.'",2005-04-22T22:00:17Z
"Hot Stars in Old Stellar Populations: A Continuing Need for Intermediate
  Ages","We investigate the effect of a small contamination of hot, old, metal-poor
starlight on the inferred stellar populations of early-type galaxies in the
core of the Coma Cluster. We find that the required correction to the Balmer
and metal absorption-line strengths for old, metal-poor stars does not
significantly affect the inferred age of the stellar population when the Hbeta
strength is large. Intermediate-aged populations are therefore still needed to
explain enhanced Balmer-line strengths in early-type galaxies. This gives us
increased confidence in our age estimates for these objects. For galaxies with
weak Balmer-line strengths corresponding to very old populations (t>10 Gyr),
however, a correction for hot stars may indeed alter the inferred age, as
previously suggested. Finally, the inferred metallicity [Z/H] will always be
higher after any correction for old, metal-poor starlight than without, but the
enhancement ratios [E/Fe] will strengthen only slightly.",2005-06-15T08:56:06Z
"Pulling out Threads from the Cosmic Tapestry: Defining Filaments of
  Galaxies","Filaments of galaxies are the dominant feature of modern large scale redshift
surveys. They can account for up to perhaps half of the baryonic mass budget of
the Universe and their distribution and abundance can help constrain
cosmological models. However, there remains no single, definitive way in which
to detect, describe and define what filaments are and their extent. This work
examines a number of physically motivated, as well as statistical, methods that
can be used to define filaments and examines their relative merits.",2005-03-14T06:06:49Z
Growth of perturbations in dark matter coupled with quintessence,"We consider the evolution of linear perturbations in models with a nonminimal
coupling between dark matter and scalar field dark energy. Growth of matter
inhomogeneities in two examples of such models proposed in the literature are
investigated in detail. Both of these models are based on a low-energy limit of
effective string theory action, and have been previously shown to naturally
lead to late acceleration of the universe. However, we find that these models
can be ruled out by taking properly into account the impact of the scalar field
coupling on the formation of structure in the dark matter density. In
particular, when the transition to acceleration in these models begins, the
interaction with dark energy enchances the small scale clustering in dark
matter much too strongly. We discuss the the role of an effective small scale
sound speed in such models with a coupled dark sector.",2005-04-26T10:59:49Z
Born-Infeld Phantom Gravastars,"We construct new gravitational vacuum star solutions with a Born-Infeld
phantom replacing the de Sitter interior. The model allows for a wide range of
masses and radii required by phenomenology, and can be motivated from low
energy string theory.",2005-03-19T11:23:04Z
"2D stationary resistive MHD flows: borderline to magnetic reconnection
  solutions","We present the basic equations for stationary, incompressible resistive MHD
flows in two dimensions. This leads to a system of differential equations for
two flux functions, one elliptic partial differential equation
(Grad-Shafranov-like) for the magnetic flux function and one for the stream
function of the flow. In these equations two potentials appear: one potential
is a generalized pressure. The second potential couples the magnetic and the
flow shear components of the system. With the restriction to flux or at least
line conserving flows one has to solve a modified Ohm's law. For the two
dimensional case these are two coupled differential equations, which represent
the borderline between the resistive but flux conserving (or line conserving)
case, and that of reconnective solutions. We discuss some simplified solutions
of these equations.",2005-05-27T14:00:38Z
Radiation spectra and polarization in magnetar bursts,"We present Monte Carlo simulations of radiative transfer in magnetar
atmospheres. We include the effects of vacuum polarization, electron and proton
scattering, and free-free absorption. Simulations are performed for the
atmosphere model with the magnetic field perpendicular and also tilted with
respect to the neutron star surface, and we show that the average spectrum does
not strongly depend on the orientation of the magnetic field. We investigate
the region of the parameter space where the vacuum absorption-like feature
appears in the spectrum and we analyze the shape of the proton cyclotron line.
Our results indicate that the existence of the vacuum polarization feature
should be a general attribute of soft gamma-ray repeaters burst spectra,
provided that the energy release takes place at the sufficiently dense region,
and the atmosphere scaleheight is large enough. We discuss the existence of
such a feature in recent observational data on these sources.",2005-02-21T20:26:10Z
Constraints on the distance to SGR 1806-20 from HI absorption,"The giant flare detected from the magnetar SGR 1806-20 on 2004 December 27
had a fluence more than 100 times higher than the only two other SGR flares
ever recorded. Whereas the fluence is independent of distance, an estimate for
the luminosity of the burst depends on the source's distance, which has
previously been argued to be ~15 kpc. The burst produced a bright radio
afterglow, against which Cameron et al. (2005) have measured an HI absorption
spectrum. This has been used to propose a revised distance to SGR 1806-20 of
between 6.4 and 9.8 kpc. Here we analyze this absorption spectrum, and compare
it both to HI emission data from the Southern Galactic Plane Survey and to
archival 12-CO survey data. We confirm ~6 kpc, as a likely lower limit on the
distance to SGR 1806-20, but argue that it is difficult to place an upper limit
on the distance to SGR 1806-20 from the HI data currently available. The
previous value of ~15 kpc thus remains the best estimate of the distance to the
source.",2005-03-08T04:10:12Z
An Axisymmetric Object-Based Search for a Flat Compact Dimension,"A method is presented to search for a hypertorus symmetry axis by the
alignment of distant objects. This offers greater sensitivity than previously
proposed object-based methods that rely on accurate true distances. When
applied to the catalog of objects with z > 1, we find no evidence for a compact
dimension. We deduce a lower limit to the compact dimension size D > 0.9 of the
distance to the cosmic horizon. This is consistent with independent constraints
from the recent analysis of the WMAP microwave background data.",2005-03-24T21:36:03Z
The Unusual Luminosity Function of the Globular Cluster M10,"We present the I-band luminosity function of the differentially reddened
globular cluster M10. We combine photometric analysis derived from wide-field
(23' x 23') images that include the outer regions of the cluster and
high-resolution images of the cluster core. After making corrections for
incompleteness and field star contamination, we find that the relative numbers
of stars on the lower giant branch and near the main-sequence turnoff are in
good agreement with theoretical predictions. However, we detect significant (>
6 \sigma) excesses of red giant branch stars above and below the red giant
branch bump using a new statistic (a population ratio) for testing relative
evolutionary timescales of main-sequence and red giant stars. The statistic is
insensitive to assumed cluster chemical composition, age, and main-sequence
mass function. The excess number of red giants cannot be explained by
reasonable systematic errors in our assumed cluster chemical composition, age,
or main-sequence mass function. Moreover, M10 shows excesses when compared to
the cluster M12, which has nearly identical metallicity, age, and
color-magnitude diagram morphology. We discuss possible reasons for this
anomaly, finding that the most likely cause is a mass function slope that shows
significant variations as a function of mass.",2005-04-08T23:51:17Z
"Optical spectroscopy of X-Mega targets in the Carina Nebula - V. The
  spectroscopic binary HD93161A and its visual companion HD93161B","We present the analysis of an extensive set of high resolution spectroscopic
observations of HD93161, a visual binary with a separation of 2 arcsec. HD93161
A is a spectroscopic binary, with both components clearly detected throughout
the orbit. The primary star is most probably of spectral type O8V, while the
secondary is likely an O9V. We obtain the first orbital solution for this
system, characterized by a period of 8.566\pm0.004 days. The minimum masses of
the primary and secondary stars are 22.2\pm0.6 M_sol and 17.0\pm0.4 M_sol
respectively. These values are quite large, suggesting a high inclination of
the orbit. The second object, HD93161 B, displays an O6.5V((f)) spectral type
and is thus slightly hotter than its neighbour. This star is at first sight
single but presents radial velocity variations. We finally study HD93161 in the
X-ray domain. No significant variability is detected. The X-ray spectrum is
well described by a 2T model with kT_1~0.3keV and kT_2~0.7keV. The X-ray
luminosity is rather moderate, without any large emission excess imputable to a
wind interaction.",2005-03-04T11:38:19Z
"Bright X-ray flares in Orion young stars from COUP: evidence for
  star-disk magnetic fields?","We have analyzed a number of intense X-ray flares observed in the Chandra
Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP), a 13 days observation of the Orion Nebula
Cluster (ONC). Analysis of the flare decay allows to determine the size, peak
density and magnetic field of the flaring structure. A total of 32 events (the
most powerful 1% of COUP flares), have sufficient statistics for the analysis.
A broad range of decay times (from 10 to 400 ks) are present in the sample.
Peak flare temperatures are often very high, with half of the flares in the
sample showing temperatures in excess of 100 MK. Significant sustained heating
is present in the majority of the flares. The magnetic structures which are
found, are in a number of cases very long, with semi-lengths up to 10^12 cm,
implying the presence of magnetic fields of hundreds of G extending to
comparable distance from the stellar photosphere. These very large sizes for
the flaring structures ($ >> R_*) are not found in more evolved stars, where,
almost invariably, the same type of analysis results in structures with L <=
R_*. As the majority of young stars in the ONC are surrounded by disks, we
speculate that the large magnetic structures which confine the flaring plasma
are actually the same type of structures which channel the plasma in the
magnetospheric accretion paradigm, connecting the star's photosphere with the
accretion disk.",2005-06-07T08:33:35Z
"Effect of component separation on the temperature distribution of the
  CMB","We present a study of the effect of component separation on the recovered
cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature distribution, considering
Gaussian and non-Gaussian input CMB maps. First, we extract the CMB component
from simulated Planck data (in small patches of the sky) using the maximum
entropy method (MEM), Wiener filter (WF) and a method based on the subtraction
of foreground templates plus a linear combination of frequency channels (LCFC).
We then apply a wavelet-based method to study the Gaussianity of the recovered
CMB and compare it with the same analysis for the input map. When the original
CMB map is Gaussian (and assuming that point sources have been removed), we
find that none of the methods introduce non-Gaussianity (NG) in the CMB
reconstruction. On the contrary, if the input CMB map is non-Gaussian, all the
studied methods produce a reconstructed CMB with lower detections of NG than
the original map. This effect is mainly due to the presence of instrumental
noise. In this case, MEM tends to produce slightly higher non-Gaussian
detections in the reconstructed map than WF whereas the detections are lower
for the LCFC. We have also studied the effect of point sources in the MEM
reconstruction. If no attempt to remove point sources is performed, they
clearly contaminate the CMB reconstruction, introducing spurious NG. When the
brightest point sources are removed from the data using the Mexican Hat
Wavelet, the Gaussian character of the CMB is preserved. However, when
analysing larger regions of the sky, the variance of our estimators will be
appreciably reduced and, in this case, we expect the point source residuals to
introduce spurious NG in the CMB. Thus, a careful subtraction (or masking) of
point source emission is crucial when studying the Gaussianity of the CMB.",2005-03-02T12:36:55Z
"High-spatial-resolution observations of NH3 and CH3OH towards the
  massive twin cores NGC6334 I & I(N)","Molecular line observations of NH3 (J,K)=(1,1), (2,2) and CH3OH at 24.93GHz
taken with the Australian Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) toward the massive
twin cores NGC6334 I & I(N) reveal significant variations in the line emission
between the two massive cores. The UCHII region/hot core NGC6334 I exhibits
strong thermal NH3 and CH3OH emission adjacent to the UCHII region and
coincident with two mm continuum peaks observed by Hunter et al. (in prep.). In
contrast, we find neither compact NH3 nor thermal CH3OH line emission toward
NGC6334 I(N). There, the NH3 emission is distributed over a broad region (>1')
without a clear peak, and we find Class I CH3OH maser emission with peak
brightness temperatures up to 7000K. The maser emission peaks appear to be
spatially associated with the interfaces between the molecular outflows and the
ambient dense gas. Peak NH3(1,1) line brightness temperatures >= 70K in both
regions indicate gas temperatures of the same order. NH3 emission is also
detected toward the outflow in NGC6334 I resulting in an estimated rotational
temperature of Trot~19K. Furthermore, we observe CH3OH and NH3 absorption
toward the UCHII region, the velocity structure is consistent with expanding
molecular gas around the UCHII region. Thermal and kinematic effects possibly
imposed from the UCHII region on the molecular core are also discussed.",2005-04-04T18:05:21Z
The cooling of shock-compressed primordial gas,"We find that at redshifts z > 10, HD line cooling allows strongly-shocked
primordial gas to cool to the temperature of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB). This temperature is the minimum value attainable via radiative cooling.
Provided that the abundance of HD, normalized to the total number density,
exceeds a critical level of ~ 10^{-8}, the CMB temperature floor is reached in
a time which is short compared to the Hubble time. We estimate the
characteristic masses of stars formed out of shocked primordial gas in the wake
of the first supernovae, and resulting from the mergers of dark matter haloes
during hierarchical structure formation to be ~ 10 M_{solar}. In addition, we
show that cooling by HD enables the primordial gas in relic H II regions to
cool to temperatures considerably lower than those reached via H_2 cooling
alone. We confirm that HD cooling is unimportant in cases where the primordial
gas does not go through an ionized phase, as in the formation process of the
very first stars in z ~ 20 minihaloes of mass ~ 10^{6} M_{solar}.",2005-05-14T00:24:33Z
Ongoing Space Physics - Astrophysics Connections,"I review several ongoing connections between space physics and astrophysics:
a) Measurements of energetic particle spectra have confirmed theoretical
prediction of the highest energy to which shocks can accelerate particles, and
this has direct bearing on the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays. b)
Mass ejection in solar flares may help us understand photon ejection in the
giant flares of magnetar outbursts. c) Measurements of electron heat fluxes in
the solar wind can help us understand whether heat flux in tenuous
astrophysical plasma is in accordance with the classical Spitzer-Harm formula
or whether it is reduced well below this value by plasma instabilities.",2005-03-16T16:20:38Z
"The Core-Collapse Supernova with ""Non-Uniform"" Magnetic Fields","We perform two-dimensional numerical simulations on the core-collapse of a
massive star with strong magnetic fields and differential rotations using a
numerical code ZEUS-2D. Changing field configurations and laws of differential
rotation parametrically, we compute 14 models and investigate effects of these
parameters on the dynamics. In our models, we do not solve the neutrino
transport and instead employ a phenomenological parametric EOS that takes into
account the neutrino emissions. As a result of the calculations, we find that
the field configuration plays a significant role in the dynamics of the core if
the initial magnetic field is large enough. Models with initially concentrated
fields produce more energetic explosions and more prolate shock waves than the
uniform field. Quadrapole-like fields produce remarkably collimated and fast
jet, which might be important for gamma-ray bursts(GRB). The Lorentz forces
exerted in the region where the plasma-beta is less than unity are responsible
for these dynamics. The pure toroidal field, on the other hand, does not lead
to any explosion or matter ejection. This suggests the presupernova models of
Heger et al.(2003), in which toroidal fields are predominant, is
disadvantageous for the magnetorotation-induced supernova considered here.
Models with initially weak magnetic fields do not lead to explosion or matter
ejection, either. In these models magnetic fields play no role as they do not
grow on the timescale considered in this paper so that the magnetic pressure
could be comparable to the matter pressure. This is because the exponential
field growth as expected in MRI is not seen in our models. The magnetic field
is amplified mainly by field-compression and field-wrapping in our simulations.",2005-05-31T16:46:56Z
Merger-Induced Starbursts,"Extragalactic starbursts induced by gravitational interactions can now be
studied from z = ~0 to ~2. The evidence that mergers of gas-rich galaxies tend
to trigger galaxy-wide starbursts is strong, both statistically and in
individual cases of major disk-disk mergers. Star formation rates appear
enhanced by factors of a few to ~10^3 above normal. Detailed studies of nearby
mergers and ULIRGs suggest that the main trigger for starbursts is the rapidly
mounting pressure of the ISM in extended shock regions, rather than high-
velocity, ~50 - 100 km/s cloud-cloud collisions. Numerical simulations
demonstrate that in colliding galaxies the star formation rate depends not only
on the gas density, but crucially also on energy dissipation in shocks. An
often overlooked characteristic of merger-induced starbursts is that the
spatial distribution of the enhanced star formation extends over large scales
(~10 - 20 kpc). Thus, although most such starbursts do peak near the galactic
centers, young stellar populations pervade merger remnants and explain why (1)
age gradients in descendent galaxies are mild and (2) resultant cluster systems
are far-flung. This review presents an overview of interesting phenomena
observed in galaxy-wide starbursts and emphasizes that such events continue to
accompany the birth of elliptical galaxies to the present epoch.",2005-02-04T21:05:24Z
"A New Determination Of The Diffuse Galactic and Extragalactic Gamma-Ray
  Emission","The GALPROP model for cosmic-ray propagation is able to make explicit
predictions for the distribution of galactic diffuse gamma-rays. We compare
different propagation models with gamma-ray spectra measured by EGRET for
various regions of the sky. This allows sensitive tests of alternative
explanations for the apparent excess emission observed at GeV gamma-rays. We
find that a population of hard-spectrum gamma-ray sources cannot be solely
responsible for the excess since it also appears at high latitudes; on the
other hand a hard cosmic-ray electron spectrum cannot explain the gamma-ray
excess in the inner Galaxy. By normalizing the cosmic ray spectra within
reasonable bounds under preservation of their shape we are able to obtain our
best prediction of the Galactic component of diffuse gamma rays, and show that
away from the Galactic plane it gives an accurate prediction of the observed
gamma-ray intensities. On this basis we reevaluate the extragalactic gamma-ray
background. We find that for some energies previous work underestimated the
Galactic contribution and hence overestimated the background. The new EGRB
spectrum shows a positive curvature similar to that expected for models of the
extragalactic gamma-ray emission based on contributions from unresolved
blazars.",2005-06-15T23:24:12Z
Direct Detection of Extra-Solar Comets is Possible,"The dust tails of comets similar to Hale-Bopp can scatter as much optical
light as does the Earth. Space-based observatories such as the Terrestrial
Planet Finder or Darwin that will detect extra-solar terrestrial planets also
will be able to detect extra-solar comets.",2005-05-24T00:43:43Z
An XMM-Newton Study of the Coronae of $σ^2$ Coronae Borealis,"(Abridged) We present results of XMM-Newton observations of the RS CVn binary
$\sigma^2$ Coronae Borealis. The RGS and EPIC MOS2 spectra were simultaneously
fitted with collisional ionization equilibrium plasma models to determine
coronal abundances of various elements. Contrary to the solar first ionization
potential (FIP) effect in which elements with a low FIP are overabundant in the
corona compared to the solar photosphere, and contrary to the ``inverse'' FIP
effect observed in several active RS CVn binaries, coronal abundance ratios in
$\sigma^2$ CrB show a complex pattern as supported by similar findings in the
Chandra HETGS analysis of $\sigma^2$ CrB with a different methodology (Osten et
al. 2003). Low-FIP elements ($<10$ eV) have their abundance ratios relative to
Fe consistent with the solar photospheric ratios, whereas high-FIP elements
have their abundance ratios increase with increasing FIP. We find that the
coronal Fe abundance is consistent with the stellar photospheric value,
indicating that there is no metal depletion in $\sigma^2$ CrB. However, we
obtain a higher Fe absolute abundance than in Osten et al. (2003). Except for
Ar and S, our absolute abundances are about 1.5 times larger than those
reported by Osten et al. (2003). However, a comparison of their model with our
XMM-Newton data (and vice versa) shows that both models work adequately in
general. We find, therefore, no preference for one methodology over the other
to derive coronal abundances. Despite the systematic discrepancy in absolute
abundances, our abundance ratios are very close to those obtained by Osten et
al. (2003). Finally, we confirm the measurement of a low density in \ion{O}{7}
($< 4 \times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$), but could not confirm the higher densities
measured in spectral lines formed at higher temperatures.",2005-06-10T16:03:24Z
On Quasilinear Perpendicular Diffusion,"Quasilinear perpendicular diffusion of charged particles in fluctuating
electromagnetic fields is the focus of this paper. A general transport
parameter for perpendicular diffusion is presented being valid for an arbitrary
turbulence geometry and a plasma wave dispersion relation varying arbitrarily
in wavevector. The new diffusion coefficient is evaluated in detail for slab
turbulence geometry for two special cases: (1) Alfv\'enic turbulence and (2)
dynamical magnetic turbulence. Furthermore, perpendicular diffusion in 2D
geometry is considered for a purely dynamical magnetic turbulence. The
derivations and numerical calculations presented here cast serious doubts on
the applicability of quasilinear theory for perpendicular diffusion.
Furthermore, they emphasize that nonlinear effects play a crucial role in the
context of perpendicular diffusion.",2005-03-26T11:27:40Z
Time-Variable Complex Metal Absorption Lines in the Quasar HS1603+3820,"We present a new spectrum of the quasar HS1603+3820 taken 1.28 years (0.36
years in the quasar rest frame) after a previous observation with Subaru+HDS.
The new spectrum enables us to search for time variability as an identifier of
intrinsic narrow absorption lines (NALs). This quasar shows a rich complex of C
IV NALs within 60,000 km/s of the emission redshift. Based on covering factor
analysis, Misawa et al. found that the C IV NAL system at z_abs= 2.42--2.45
(System A, at a shift velocity of v_sh = 8,300--10,600 km/s relative to the
quasar) was intrinsic to the quasar. With our new spectrum, we perform time
variability analysis as well as covering factor analysis to separate intrinsic
NALs from intervening NALs for 8 C IV systems. Only System A, which was
identified as an intrinsic system in the earlier paper by Misawa et al., shows
a strong variation in line strength (W_obs ~ 10.4A -> 19.1A). We speculate that
a broad absorption line (BAL) could be forming in this quasar. We illustrate
the plausibility of this suggestion with the help of a simulation. Under the
assumption that a change of ionization state causes the variability, a lower
limit can be placed on the electron density (n_e > 3x10^4 cm^-3) and an upper
limit on the distance from the continuum source (r < 6 kpc). On the other hand,
if the motion of clumpy gas causes the variability (a more likely scenario),
the crossing velocity and the distance from the continuum source are estimated
to be v_cross > 8,000 km/s and r < 3 pc. In this case, the absorber does not
intercept any flux from the broad emission line region, but only flux from the
UV continuum source. If we adopt the dynamical model of Murray et al., we can
obtain a much more strict constraint on the distance of the gas parcel from the
continuum source, r < 0.2 pc.",2005-04-29T14:29:12Z
Comparative Planetary Atmospheres: Models of TrES-1 and HD209458b,"We present new self-consistent atmosphere models for transiting planets
TrES-1 and HD209458b. The planets were recently observed with the Spitzer Space
Telescope in bands centered on 4.5 and 8.0 $\mu$m, for TrES-1, and 24 $\mu$m,
for HD209458b. We find that standard solar metallicity models fit the
observations for HD209458b. For TrES-1, which has an T_eff ~300 K cooler, we
find that models with a metallicity 3-5 times enhanced over solar abundances
can match the 1$\sigma$ error bar at 4.5 $\mu$m and 2$\sigma$ at 8.0$\mu$m.
Models with solar abundances that included energy deposition into the
stratosphere give fluxes that fall within the 2$\sigma$ error bars in both
bands. The best-fit models for both planets assume that reradiation of absorbed
stellar flux occurs over the entire planet. For all models of both planets we
predict planet/star flux ratios in other Spitzer bandpasses.",2005-05-17T20:13:27Z
Is there a phase constraint for solar dynamo models?,"The spatio-temporal relationship between the sign of the observed radial
component of the magnetic field at the solar surface and the sign of the
toroidal field as inferred from Hale's polarity rules for sunspots is usually
interpreted as signifying the phase relation between the poloidal and the
toroidal magnetic field components involved in the solar dynamo process. This
has been taken as a constraint for models of the solar dynamo. This note draws
attention to the fact that the observed phase relation is naturally and
inevitably produced by the emergence of tilted bipolar regions and flux
transport through surface flows, without any necessity of recourse to the
dynamo process. Consequently, there is no constraint on dynamo models resulting
from the observed phase relation.",2005-05-30T12:32:30Z
"Cross Correlations of X-ray and Optically Selected Clusters With Near
  Infrared and Optical Galaxies","We compute the real-space cluster-galaxy cross-correlation xi_cg(r) using the
ROSAT-ESO Flux Limited X-ray (REFLEX) cluster survey, a group catalogue
constructed from the final version of the 2dFGRS, and galaxies extracted from
2MASS and APM surveys. This first detailed calculation of the cross-correlation
for X-ray clusters and groups, is consistent with previous works and shows that
xi_cg(r) can not be described by a single power law. We analyse the clustering
dependence on the cluster X-ray luminosity L_X and virial mass M_vir thresholds
as well as on the galaxy limiting magnitude. We also make a comparison of our
results with those obtained for the halo-mass cross-correlation function in a
LambdaCDM N-body simulation to infer the scale dependence of galaxy bias around
clusters. Our results indicate that the distribution of galaxies shows a
significant anti-bias at highly non-linear small cluster-centric distances
(b_cg(r) ~ 0.7), irrespective of the group/cluster virial mass or X-ray
luminosity and galaxy characteristics, which show that a generic process
controls the efficiency of galaxy formation and evolution in high density
regions. On larger scales b_cg(r) rises to a nearly constant value of order
unity, the transition occuring at approximately 2 Mpch^(-1) for 2dF groups and
5 Mpch^(-1) for REFLEX clusters.",2005-03-08T15:46:24Z
"Constraining the Spectrum of Supernova Neutrinos from
  Neutrino-Process-Induced Light-Element Synthesis","We constrain energy spectra of supernova neutrinos through the avoidance of
an overproduction of the 11B abundance during Galactic chemical evolution. In
supernova nucleosynthesis calculations with a parametrized neutrino spectrum as
a function of temperature of mu- and tau-neutrinos and their antiparticles and
total neutrino energy, we find a strong neutrino temperature dependence of 11B
yield. When the yield is combined with observed abundances, the acceptable
range of the temperature of mu- and tau-neutrinos and their antiparticles is
found to be 4.8 and 6.6 MeV. Non-zero chemical potentials would reduce this
temperature range by about 10% for a degeneracy parameter smaller than 3.",2005-05-02T21:01:22Z
"The Stochastic Effect of Ly-alpha absorbers on Broadband Luminosities of
  Galaxies","We investigate the variations of broadband luminosities of low and
intermediate redshift galaxies due to the stochastic nature of the neutral
hydrogen present in form of Ly-alpha absorbers in the intergalactic medium.
This effect is caused by variations in the distribution and properties
(redshift, column density, Doppler parameter) of the absorbers along different
lines-of-sight out to a given redshift. Using a set of observationally
constrained redshift-, column density- and Doppler parameter distributions we
perform Monte Carlo simulations for a large number of lines-of-sight towards
galaxies at a given redshift z and calculate attenuated FUV/NUV magnitudes and
corresponding 1-, 2- and 3-sigma variations. We predict significant variations
in luminosity ranging from -0.22 to +0.48 magnitudes at the 1-sigma level for
galaxies at z=1.5 in GALEX data.",2005-04-25T16:21:00Z
Burst Neutrinos from Nitrogen Flash,"Neutrinos give a novel probe to explore deep interior of astrophysical
objects, which otherwise is not accessible with optical observations; among
notable examples are solar and supernova neutrinos. We show that there is a new
class of strong neutrino emission from helium burning, N + alpha --> 18F gamma
followed by beta decay 18F --> 18O + e+ + nu_e, that gives a maximum neutrino
luminosity of 10^8 times the solar bolometric luminosity at the helium-core
flash of a 1 M_sun star, whereas the flash is not observable by optical means.
This means that the neutrino flux, of average energy of 0.382 MeV, will be 10%
the solar CNO neutrino flux on Earth if the star is located at 10pc.",2005-05-16T22:15:33Z
Early decline spectra of Nova SMC 2001 and Nova LMC 2002,"We report results on the spectroscopic follow-up of Nova SMC 2001 and Nova
LMC 2002 carried out at La Silla. The analysis of the spectroscopic evolution
shows that these objects belong to the {\sl Fe II} class, according to the
Cerro Tololo scheme. From the line fluxes and the expansion velocities, we have
derived an approximate mass for the ejected shells of 2$\div3\times 10^{-4}
M_\odot$. The filling factor measurements ($\epsilon\sim 10^{-4}\div 10^{-1}$)
suggest a clumpy structure for the ejecta.",2005-04-06T15:50:39Z
Comment on the Origin of the Supermassive Black Hole,"We give the comment why the supermassive black hole exists at the center of
almost all galaxies. We consider the origin of the supermassive black hole from
the point of view of the density of the matter. If the density of the matter is
fixed and such matter can come together by the gravitational attraction, such
stellar object eventually becomes the black hole. If the density of the matter
is that of the atom, such matter naturally comes together to form the black
hole by the gravitational attraction. This is expected to be the process to
form the supermassive black hole. In this way, we can understand that there

Resonant absorption in dissipative flux tubes,"We study the resonant absorption of MHD waves in magnetized flux tubes with a
radial density inhomogeneity. Within the approximation that resistive and
viscous processes are operative in thin layers surrounding the singularities of
the MHD equations, we give the full spectrum of the eigenfrequencies and
damping rates of the MHD quasi modes of the tube. Both surface and body modes
are analyzed. \keywords{Sun -- corona: magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) -- Sun:

"Can the rotation of the dark matter halo of our galaxy be detected
  through its effect on the cosmic microwave background polarisation?","The proposition that dark matter halos possess angular momentum, though
widely accepted, is a theoretical prediction which has, till date, not been
observationally verified. The gravi-magnetic field produced by a rotating
gravitating object is possibly the only direct consequence of the angular
momentum of dark matter halos. The gravitational Faraday rotation produced by
the dark matter halo of our galaxy is present in all astronomical observations.
A detection of the imprint of this effect on the all-sky cosmic microwave
background radiation polarisation pattern would directly probe the angular
momentum of the dark matter halo of our Galaxy. We have calculated the expected
gravitational Faraday rotation which turns out to be a $(v_c/c)^3$ effect,
$v_c$ being the rotational speed of our halo. The predicted gravitational
Faraday effect rotation angles are less than $1^{''}$, implying that this
effect, though present, is too small to be detected.",2005-06-01T08:19:12Z
"Propagation of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays above $10^{19}$ eV in a
  Structured Extragalactic Magnetic Field and Galactic Magnetic Field","We present numerical simulations on propagation of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic
Rays (UHECRs) above $10^{19}$ eV in a structured extragalactic magnetic field
(EGMF) and simulate their arrival distributions at the earth. We use the IRAS
PSCz catalogue in order to construct a model of the EGMF and source models of
UHECRs, both of which reproduce the local structures observed around the Milky
Way. We also consider modifications of UHECR arrival directions by the galactic
magnetic field. We follow an inverse process of their propagation from the
earth and record the trajectories. This enables us to calculate only
trajectories of UHECRs arriving at the earth, which saves the CPU time. From
these trajectories and our source models, we construct arrival distributions of
UHECRs and calculate the harmonic amplitudes and the two point correlation
functions of them. We estimate number density of sources which reproduces the
Akeno Ground Air Shower Array (AGASA) observation best. As a result, we find
that the most appropriate number density of the sources is $\sim 5 \times
10^{-6}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. This constrains the source candidates of UHECRs. We also
demonstrate skymaps of their arrival distribution with the event number
expected by future experiments and examine how the EGMF affects their arrival
distribution. A main result is diffusion of clustering events which are
obtained from calculations in the absence of the EGMF. This tendency allows us
to reproduce the observed two point correlation function better.",2005-06-09T13:48:08Z
The Payload Data Handling and Telemetry Systems of Gaia,"The Payload Data Handling System (PDHS) of Gaia is a technological challenge,
since it will have to process a huge amount of data with limited resources. Its
main tasks include the optimal codification of science data, its packetisation
and its compression, before being stored on-board ready to be transmitted. Here
we describe a set of proposals for its design, as well as some simulators
developed to optimise and test these proposals.",2005-04-12T22:33:46Z
"An application of Green-function methods to gravitational radiation
  theory","Previous work in the literature has studied gravitational radiation in
black-hole collisions at the speed of light. In particular, it had been proved
that the perturbative field equations may all be reduced to equations in only
two independent variables, by virtue of a conformal symmetry at each order in
perturbation theory. The Green function for the perturbative field equations is
here analyzed by studying the corresponding second-order hyperbolic operator
with variable coefficients, instead of using the reduction method from the
retarded flat-space Green function in four dimensions. After reduction to
canonical form of this hyperbolic operator, the integral representation of the
solution in terms of the Riemann function is obtained. The Riemann function
solves a characteristic initial-value problem for which analytic formulae
leading to the numerical solution are derived.",2005-04-27T13:53:33Z
Properties of Central Caustics in Planetary Microlensing,"To maximize the number of planet detections, current microlensing follow-up
observations are focusing on high-magnification events which have a higher
chance of being perturbed by central caustics. In this paper, we investigate
the properties of central caustics and the perturbations induced by them. We
derive analytic expressions of the location, size, and shape of the central
caustic as a function of the star-planet separation, $s$, and the planet/star
mass ratio, $q$, under the planetary perturbative approximation and compare the
results with those based on numerical computations. While it has been known
that the size of the planetary caustic is \propto \sqrt{q}, we find from this
work that the dependence of the size of the central caustic on $q$ is linear,
i.e., \propto q, implying that the central caustic shrinks much more rapidly
with the decrease of $q$ compared to the planetary caustic. The central-caustic
size depends also on the star-planet separation. If the size of the caustic is
defined as the separation between the two cusps on the star-planet axis
(horizontal width), we find that the dependence of the central-caustic size on
the separation is \propto (s+1/s). While the size of the central caustic
depends both on $s$ and q, its shape defined as the vertical/horizontal width
ratio, R_c, is solely dependent on the planetary separation and we derive an
analytic relation between R_c and s. Due to the smaller size of the central
caustic combined with much more rapid decrease of its size with the decrease of
q, the effect of finite source size on the perturbation induced by the central
caustic is much more severe than the effect on the perturbation induced by the
planetary caustic. Abridged.",2005-05-18T06:35:05Z
"Effects of new long-range interaction: Recombination of relic Heavy
  neutrinos and antineutrinos","If stable Heavy neutrinos of 4th generation possess their own Coulomb-like
interaction, recombination of pairs of Heavy neutrinos and antineutrinos can
play important role in their cosmological evolution and lead to observable
consequences. In particular, effect of this new interaction in the annihilation
of neutrino-antineutrino pairs can account for $\gamma$-flux observed by EGRET.",2005-04-27T22:57:30Z
"The environment of dwarf spheroidal satellites; ram pressure, tides and
  external radiation fields","We discuss the role of environmental mechanisms in the evolution of dwarf
galaxy satellites using high-resolution N-Body+SPH simulations that include
simultaneously tidal forces, ram pressure and heating from ionizing radiation
fields. Tidally induced bar-buckling instabilities can transform a rotating
disky dwarf into a pressure supported spheroidal. Efficient gas removal
requires instead a combination of tidal mass loss and ram pressure stripping in
a diffuse gaseous corona around the primary system. The efficiency of ram
pressure depends strongly on how extended the gas remains during the evolution.
Bar driven inflows that tend to drive the gas to the bottom of the potential
well can be opposed by the heating from ultraviolet radiation. We show that
even fairly massive dwarfs ($V_{peak} >$ 30 km/s) would be stripped of their
gas over a few Gyr if they enter the Milky Way halo at $z > 2$ thanks to the
effect of the cosmic UV background. Gas mass loss can be much faster, occurring
in less than 1 Gyr, if dwarf satellites have their first close approach with
the primary at the epoch of bulge formation. Indeed at that time the primary
galaxy should have a FUV luminosity comparable to that of major present-day
starbursts, resulting in a local radiation field even more intense than the
cosmic background.",2005-05-04T12:40:57Z
On the proper motion of AXP 1E2259+586,"1E2259+586 belongs to the group of anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXP) which are
thought to be magnetars. Accurate measurements of the proper motion for these
interesting objects have not been made. In this work we use the data obtained
by satellites ROSAT, Chandra and XMM-Newton taken in a period of 12 years to
measure the change in position of 1E2259+586 with respect to the three field
sources. Our work yielded an upper limit on the proper motion of ~170 mas/yr
which corresponds to a transverse speed of 2500 km/s, for an assumed distance
of 3 kpc. We also used this upper limit to put a lower limit on the age of the
CTB 109 of ~6 kyr, assuming they are associated. The consistency of right
ascension and declination measurements by different satellites suggest that we
can average these measurements to get the best to date position of 1E2259+586.",2005-03-09T18:57:43Z
"Non-Gaussianity due to Possible Residual Foreground Signals in WMAP
  1st-year Data Using Spherical Wavelet Approaches","We perform multi-scale non-Gaussianity detection and localization to the
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) first-year data in both wavelet and
real spaces. Such an analysis is facilitated by spherical wavelet transform and
inverse transform techniques developed by the YAWtb team. Skewness and kurtosis
as test statistics are calculated on scales from about $1^{\circ}$ to
$30^{\circ}$ on the sky as well as toward different directions using
anisotropic spherical Morlet wavelet (SMW). A maximum deviation from Gaussian
simulations with a right tail probability of $\sim 99.9%$ is detected at an
angular scale of $\sim12^{\circ}$ at an azimuthal orientation of $\sim
0^{\circ}$ on the sky. In addition, some significant non-Gaussian spots have
been identified and localized in real space from both the combined Q-V-W map
recommended by the WMAP team and the Tegmark foreground-cleaned map. Systematic
effects due to beams and noise can be rejected as the source of this
non-Gaussianity. Several tests show that residual foreground contamination may
significantly contribute to this non-Gaussian feature. It is thus still
premature to do more precise tests on the non-Gaussianity of the intrinsic CMB
fluctuations before we can identify the origin of these foreground signals,
understand their nature, and finally remove them from the CMB maps completely.",2005-04-27T05:33:51Z
"The NICMOS Ultra Deep Field: Observations, Data Reduction, and Galaxy
  Photometry","This paper describes the observations and data reduction techniques for the
version 2.0 images and catalog of the NICMOS Ultra Deep Field Treasury program.
All sources discussed in this paper are based on detections in the combined
NICMOS F110W and F160W bands only. The NICMOS images are drizzled to 0.09 arc
second pixels and aligned to the ACS UDF F850LP image which was rebinned to the
same pixel scale. These form the NICMOS version 2.0 UDF images. The catalog
sources are chosen with a conservative detection limit to avoid the inclusion
of numerous spurious sources. The catalog contains 1293 objects in the 144 x
144 arc sececonds NICMOS subfield of the UDF. The 5 sigma signal to noise level
is an average 0.6 arc second diameter aperture AB magnitude of ~27.7 at 1.1 and
1.6 microns. The catalog sources, listed in order of right ascension, satisfy a
minimum signal to noise criterion of 1.4 sigma in at least 7 contiguous pixels
of the combined F110W and F160W image",2005-03-23T17:06:09Z
Scaling variability from stellar to supermassive black holes,"We investigate the correspondence between the variability seen in the stellar
and supermassive black holes. Galactic Black Hole (GBH) power density spectra
(PDS) are generally complex, and dependent on spectral state. In the low/hard
state the high-frequency rollover in the PDS moves in a way which is not simply
related to luminosity. Hence this feature can only be used as an approximate
indicator rather than as an accurate tracer of black hole mass in AGN. The
X-ray spectrum in the high/soft state is dominated by the disc in GBH, which is
rather stable. We show that the PDS of the Comptonized tail in GBH can be much
more variable, and that it is this which should be compared to AGN due to their
much lower disc temperature. This bandpass effect removes a problem in
interpreting the (often highly variable) Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies
as the counterparts of the high mass accretion rate GBH. Additionally, we
speculate that some NLS1 (e.g. Akn 564) are counterparts of the very high
state. The Comptonized tail in this state is also highly variable, but with PDS
which can be roughly described as band-limited noise. This shape is similar to
that seen in the low/hard state, so merely seeing such band-limited noise in
the power spectrum of an AGN does not necessarily imply low luminosity. We also
stress that Cyg X-1, often used for comparison with AGN, is not a typical black
hole system due to its persistent nature. In particular, the shape of its power
spectrum in the high/soft state is markedly different from that of other
(transient) GBH systems in this state. The fact that the NLS1s NGC 4051 and
MCG-6-30-15 do appear to show a power spectrum similar to that of the high/soft
state of Cyg X-1 may lend observational support to theoretical speculation that
the Hydrogen ionization disc instability does not operate in AGN.",2005-05-10T09:52:52Z
"Self-similar structure of the magnetized radiation-dominated accretion
  disks","We investigate the effects of a large-scale magnetic field with open field
lines on the steady-state structure of a radiation-dominated accretion disk,
using self-similarity technique. The disk is supposed to be turbulent and
possesses an effective viscosity and an effective magnetic diffusivity. We
consider the extreme case in which the generated energy due to viscous and
magnetic dissipation is balanced by the advection cooling. While the magnetic
field outside of the disk is treated in a phenomenological way, the internal
field is determined self-consistently. Magnetized and nonmagnetized solutions
have the same radial dependence, irrespective of the values of the input
parameters. Generally, our self-similar solutions are very sensitive to the
viscosity or diffusivity coefficients. For example, the density and the
rotation velocity increase when the viscosity coefficient decreases. The gas
rotates with sub-Keplerian angular velocity with a factor less than unity which
depends on the magnetic field configuration. Magnetic field significantly
reduce disk thickness, however, tends to increase the radial velocity comparing
to the nonmagnetic self-similar solutions.",2005-05-28T06:18:48Z
The 1st INTEGRAL SPI-ACS Gamma-Ray Burst Catalogue,"We present the sample of gamma-ray bursts detected with the anti-coincidence
shield ACS of the spectrometer SPI on-board INTEGRAL for the first 26.5 months
of mission operation (up to Jan 2005). SPI-ACS works as a nearly
omnidirectional gamma-ray burst detector above ~80 keV but lacks spatial and
spectral information. In this catalogue, the properties derived from the 50 ms
light curves (e.g., T90, Cmax, Cint, variability, V/Vmax) are given for each
candidate burst in the sample. A strong excess of very short events with
durations <0.25 s is found. This population is shown to be significantly
different from the short- and long-duration burst sample by means of the
intensity distribution and V/Vmax test and is certainly connected with cosmic
ray hits in the detector. A rate of 0.3 true gamma-ray bursts per day is
observed.",2005-04-15T18:22:44Z
"Lepton asymmetry and primordial nucleosynthesis in the era of precision
  cosmology","We calculate and display the primordial light-element abundances as a
function of a neutrino degeneracy parameter \xi common to all flavors. It is
the only unknown parameter characterizing the thermal medium at the primordial
nucleosynthesis epoch. The observed primordial helium abundance Y_p is the most
sensitive cosmic ``leptometer.'' Adopting the conservative Y_p error analysis
of Olive and Skillman implies -0.04 \alt \xi \alt 0.07 whereas the errors
stated by Izotov and Thuan imply \xi=0.0245+-0.0092 (1 sigma). Improved
determinations of the baryon abundance have no significant impact on this
situation. A determination of Y_p that reliably distinguishes between a
vanishing or nonvanishing \xi is a crucial test of the cosmological standard
assumption that sphaleron effects equilibrate the cosmic lepton and baryon
asymmetries.",2005-06-08T08:39:57Z
Circumstellar Dust Disks in Taurus-Auriga: The Submillimeter Perspective,"We present a sensitive, multiwavelength submillimeter continuum survey of 153
young stellar objects in the Taurus-Auriga star formation region. The
submillimeter detection rate is 61% to a completeness limit of ~10 mJy
(3-sigma) at 850 microns. The inferred circumstellar disk masses are
log-normally distributed with a mean mass of ~0.005 solar masses and a large
dispersion (0.5 dex). Roughly one third of the submillimeter sources have disk
masses larger than the minimal nebula from which the solar system formed. The
median disk to star mass ratio is 0.5%. The empirical behavior of the
submillimeter continuum is best described as F_nu ~ nu^(2.0 +/- 0.5) between
350 microns and 1.3 mm, which we argue is due to the combined effects of the
fraction of optically thick emission and a flatter frequency behavior of the
opacity compared to the ISM. This latter effect could be due to a substantial
population of large dust grains, which presumably would have grown through
collisional agglomeration. In this sample, the only stellar property that is
correlated with the outer disk is the presence of a companion. We find evidence
for significant decreases in submillimeter flux densities, disk masses, and
submillimeter continuum slopes along the canonical infrared spectral energy
distribution evolution sequence for young stellar objects. The fraction of
objects detected in the submillimeter is essentially identical to the fraction
with excess near-infrared emission, suggesting that dust in the inner and outer
disk are removed nearly simultaneously.",2005-06-08T22:53:56Z
Crossing the Phantom Divide Barrier with Scalar Tensor Theories,"There is accumulating observational evidence (based on SnIa data) that the
dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ may be evolving with time and
crossing the phantom divide barrier $w=-1$ at recent times. The confirmation of
these indications by future data would indicate that minimally coupled
quintessence can not reproduce the observed expansion rate $H(z)$ for any
scalar field potential. Here we explicitly demonstrate that scalar tensor
theories of gravity (extended quintessence) can predict crossing of the phantom
divide barrier. We reconstruct phenomenologically viable scalar-tensor
potentials $F(\Phi)$ and $U(\Phi)$ that can reproduce a polynomial best fit
expansion rate $H(z)$ and the corresponding dark energy equation of state
parameter $w(z)$ crossing the $w=-1$ line. The form of the reconstructed scalar
tensor potentials is severely constrained but is not uniquely determined. This
is due to observational uncertainties in the form of $H(z)$ and also because a
single observed function $H(z)$ does not suffice for the reconstruction of the
two potential functions $F(\Phi)$ and $U(\Phi)$.",2005-04-26T20:08:31Z
X-ray Binaries in the Globular Cluster 47 Tucanae,"Chandra observations of globular clusters provide insight into the formation,
evolution, and X-ray emission mechanisms of X-ray binary populations. Our
recent (2002) deep observations of 47 Tuc allow detailed study of its
populations of quiescent LMXBs, CVs, MSPs, and active binaries (ABs). First
results include the confirmation of a magnetic CV in a globular cluster, the
identification of 31 additional chromospherically active binaries, and the
identification of three additional likely quiescent LMXBs containing neutron
stars. Comparison of the X-ray properties of the known MSPs in 47 Tuc with the
properties of the sources of uncertain nature indicates that relatively few
X-ray sources are MSPs, probably only ~30 and not more than 60. Considering the
\~30 implied MSPs and 5 (candidate) quiescent LMXBs, and their canonical
lifetimes of 10 and 1 Gyr respectively, the relative birthrates of MSPs and
LMXBs in 47 Tuc are comparable.",2005-03-07T01:36:32Z
"A Comparison of surface brightness profiles for ultra-compact dwarfs and
  dwarf elliptical nuclei: implications for the `threshing' scenario","Using imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope, we derive surface brightness
profiles for ultra-compact dwarfs in the Fornax cluster and for the nuclei of
dwarf elliptical galaxies in the Virgo cluster. Ultra-compact dwarfs are more
extended and have higher surface brightnesses than typical dwarf nuclei, while
the luminosities, colors, and sizes of the nuclei are closer to those of
Galactic globular clusters. This calls into question the production of
ultra-compact dwarfs via ``threshing'' whereby the lower surface brightness
envelope of a dwarf elliptical is removed by tidal processes, leaving behind a
bare nucleus. Threshing may still be a viable model if the relatively bright
Fornax ultra compact dwarfs considered here are descended from dwarf
ellipticals whose nuclei are at the upper end of their luminosity and size
distributions.",2005-03-17T03:03:41Z
"Batch discovery of nine z~1 clusters using x-ray and K or R,z' images","We present results of an initial search for clusters of galaxies at z~1 and
above, using data from 2.9 square degrees of XMM-Newton images. By selecting
weak potentially extended X-ray sources with faint or no identifications in
deep, ground-based optical imaging, we have constructed a starting sample of 19
high redshift cluster candidates. Near-IR and R,z' imaging of these fields
identified nine of them as high redshift systems. Six of these were confirmed
spectroscopically, three at z~1.0 and the other three in 0.8<z<0.92 range. The
remaining three systems have solid photometric evidence to be at z_phot ~ 0.8,
1.0 and 1.3. The present sample significantly increases the number of such
clusters. The measured density of z>~1 clusters, after discarding ""low""
redshift systems at z <~ 0.92 is about 1.7 /deg2 (with 68 % confidence interval
equal to [1.0,2.9]) for f_X >~2.5 10^{-15} ergs/cm2/s ([0.5-2] keV) and this is
a lower limit, having screened not all potential z~1 candidate clusters.

clusters is given.",2005-03-10T09:20:54Z
Parametrization of Quintessence and Its Potential,"We develop a theoretical method of constructing the quintessence potential
directly from the effective equation of state function $w(z)$, which describes
the properties of the dark energy. We apply our method to four parametrizations
of equation of state parameter and discuss the general features of the
resulting potentials. In particular, it is shown that the constructed
quintessence potentials are all in the form of a runaway type.",2005-05-12T15:00:14Z
Weak Lensing Mass Reconstruction using Wavelets,"This paper presents a new method for the reconstruction of weak lensing mass
maps. It uses the multiscale entropy concept, which is based on wavelets, and
the False Discovery Rate which allows us to derive robust detection levels in
wavelet space. We show that this new restoration approach outperforms several
standard techniques currently used for weak shear mass reconstruction. This
method can also be used to separate E and B modes in the shear field, and thus
test for the presence of residual systematic effects. We concentrate on large
blind cosmic shear surveys, and illustrate our results using simulated shear
maps derived from N-Body Lambda-CDM simulations with added noise corresponding
to both ground-based and space-based observations.",2005-03-16T21:31:01Z
Correcting systematic effects in a large set of photometric lightcurves,"We suggest a new algorithm to remove systematic effects in a large set of
lightcurves obtained by a photometric survey. The algorithm can remove
systematic effects, like the ones associated with atmospheric extinction,
detector efficiency, or PSF changes over the detector. The algorithm works
without any prior knowledge of the effects, as long as they linearly appear in
many stars of the sample. The approach, which was originally developed to
remove atmospheric extinction effects, is based on a lower rank approximation
of matrices, an approach which was already suggested and used in chemometrics,
for example. The proposed algorithm is specially useful in cases where the
uncertainties of the measurements are unequal. For equal uncertainties the
algorithm reduces to the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) algorithm. We
present a simulation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
and point out its potential, in search for transit candidates in particular.",2005-02-03T20:25:47Z
"A Link between Prompt Optical and Prompt Gamma-Ray Emission in Gamma-Ray
  Bursts","The prompt optical emission that arrives with gamma-rays from a cosmic
gamma-ray burst (GRB) is a signature of the engine powering the burst, the
properties of the ultra-relativistic ejecta of the explosion, and the ejecta's
interactions with the surroundings. Until now, only GRB 990123 had been
detected at optical wavelengths during the burst phase. Its prompt optical
emission was variable and uncorrelated with the prompt gamma-ray emission,
suggesting that the optical emission was generated by a reverse shock arising
from the ejecta's collision with the surrounding material. Here we report
prompt optical emission from GRB 041219a. It is variable and correlated with
the prompt gamma-rays, indicating a common origin for the optical light and the
gamma-rays. Within the context of the standard fireball model of GRBs, we
attribute this new optical component to internal shocks driven into the burst
ejecta by variations of the inner engine. The correlated optical emission is a
direct probe of the jet isolated from the medium. The timing of the
uncorrelated optical emission is strongly dependent on the nature of the
medium.",2005-03-23T22:59:26Z
"A HST study of the stellar populations in the cometary dwarf irregular
  galaxy NGC 2366","We present V and I photometry of the resolved stars in the cometary dwarf
irregular galaxy NGC 2366, using Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 images obtained
with the Hubble Space Telescope. The resulting color-magnitude diagram reaches
down to I~26.0 mag. It reveals not only a young population of blue
main-sequence stars (age <30 Myr) but also an intermediate-age population of
blue and red supergiants (20 Myr<age<100 Myr), and an older evolved populations
of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars (age >100 Myr) and red giant branch
(RGB) stars (age >1 Gyr). The measured magnitude I=23.65+/-0.10 mag of the RGB
tip results in a distance modulus m-M=27.67+/-0.10, which corresponds to a
distance of 3.42+/-0.15 Mpc, in agreement with previous distance
determinations. The youngest stars are associated with the bright complex of
HII regions NGC 2363=Mrk 71 in the southwest extremity of the galaxy. As a
consequence of the diffusion and relaxation processes of stellar ensembles, the
older the stellar population is, the smoother and more extended is its spatial
distribution. An underlying population of older stars is found throughout the
body of NGC 2366. The most notable feature of this older population is the
presence of numerous relatively bright AGB stars. The number ratio of AGB to
RGB stars and the average absolute brightness of AGB stars in NGC 2366 are
appreciably higher than in the BCD VII Zw 403, indicating a younger age of the
AGB stars in NGC 2366. In addition to the present burst of age <100 Myr, there
has been strong star formation activity in the past of NGC 2366, from ~100 Myr
to <3 Gyr ago.",2005-03-19T22:25:08Z
High Energy Neutrinos as a Probe for New Physics and Astrophysics,"A review of the recent achievements in high energy neutrino physics and,

The pressure distribution in thermally bistable turbulent flows,"We present a systematic numerical study of the effect of turbulent velocity
fluctuations on the thermal pressure distribution in thermally bistable flows.
The simulations employ a random turbulent driving generated in Fourier space
rather than star-like heating. The turbulent fluctuations are characterized by
their rms Mach number M and the energy injection wavenumber, k_for. Our results
are consistent with the picture that as either of these parameters is
increased, the local ratio of turbulent crossing time to cooling time
decreases, causing transient structures in which the effective behavior is
intermediate between the thermal-equilibrium and adiabatic regimes. As a
result, the effective polytropic exponent gamma_ef ranges between ~0.2 to ~1.1.
The fraction of high-density zones with P>10^4 Kcm^-3 increases from roughly
0.1% at k_for=2 and M=0.5 to roughly 70% for k_for=16 and M=1.25. A preliminary
comparison with the pressure measurements of Jenkins (2004) favors our case
with M=0.5 and k_for=2. In all cases, the dynamic range of the pressure summed
over the entire density range, typically spans 3-4 orders of magnitude. The
total pressure histogram widens as the Mach number is increased, and develops
near-power-law tails at high (resp.low) pressures when gamma_ef<~ 0.5 (resp.
gamma_ef>~ 1), which occurs at k_for=2 (resp.k_for=16) in our simulations. The
opposite side of the pressure histogram decays rapidly, in an approx. lognormal
form. Our results show that turbulent advection alone can generate large
pressure scatters, with power-law high-P tails for large-scale driving, and
provide validation for approaches attempting to derive the shape of the
pressure histogram through a change of variable from the known form of the
density histogram, such as that performed by MacLow et al.(2004).",2005-04-20T16:27:26Z
The Devil is in the Details: Compact Structures in Pulsar Wind Nebulae,"The large-scale structure of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) tells us a
considerable amount about their average magnetic fields, the total particle
input from the pulsar winds, and the confining pressure at their outer
boundaries. However, the details of the pulsar outflow, the sites of shocks and
particle acceleration, the effects of instabilities in the magnetic field, and
the interaction between the relativistic wind and the surrounding ejecta are
contained in small-scale structures, where we observe jets and toroidal
structures, time-varying emission from compact clumps, and filaments in both
the inner and outer regions of the nebulae. Here I review recent observational
studies of compact structures in PWNe and present current scenarios (and
questions) regarding their origin.",2005-04-05T12:41:41Z
"Ultraviolet, X-ray, and Optical Radiation from the Geminga Pulsar","We observed the gamma-ray pulsar Geminga with the HST STIS/MAMA detectors to
measure the Geminga's UV spectrum and pulsations. The slope of the far-UV (FUV)
spectrum is close to that of a Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum, suggesting that the FUV
radiation is dominated by thermal emission from the neutron star (NS) surface.
The measured FUV flux, F_FUV=(3.7+/-0.2)x10^-15 ergs cm^-2 s^-1 in 1155-1702 A
band, corresponds to a brightness temperature T_RJ=(0.3-0.4)(d_200/R_13)^2 MK.
The soft thermal component of the Geminga's X-ray spectrum measured with the
XMM-Newton observatory corresponds to a temperature T_s=0.49+/-0.01 MK and
radius R_s = (12.9+/-1.0)d_200 km. Unlike other NSs detected in the UV-optical,
the FUV spectrum of Geminga lies below the extrapolation of the soft thermal
component, which might be associated with the Geminga's very low temperature.
Surprisingly, the thermal FUV radiation is strongly pulsed, showing a narrow
dip at a phase close to that of a broader minimum of the soft X-ray light
curve. The strong pulsations might be attributed to partial occultations of the
thermal UV radiation by regions of the magnetosphere filled with
electron/positron plasma. In contrast with the FUV spectrum, the near-IR (NIR)
through near-UV (NUV) spectrum of Geminga is clearly nonthermal. It can be
described by a power-law model, F_nu \propto nu^{-alpha} with a slope alpha =
0.43+/-0.15, close to alpha = 0.56+/-0.24 of the hard X-ray (E>2.5 keV)
magnetospheric component. The observed NIR-optical-NUV spectrum is marginally
consistent with the extrapolation of the X-ray magnetospheric spectrum. The NUV
pulsations, however, do not show a clear correlation with the hard X-ray
pulsations.",2005-02-03T19:56:40Z
"High Energy Afterglow Emission from Giant Flares of Soft Gamma-Ray
  Repeaters: The Case of the 2004 December 27 Event from SGR 1806-20","We discuss the high enegry afterglow emission (including high energy photons,
neutrinos and cosmic rays) following the 2004 December 27 Giant Flare from SGR
1806-20. If the initial outflow is relativistic with a bulk Lorentz factor
\Gamma_0\sim {\rm tens}, the high-energy tail of the synchrotron emission from
electrons in the forward shock region gives rise to a prominent sub-GeV
emission, if the electron spectrum is hard enough and if the intial Lorentz
factor is high enough. This signal could serve as a diagnosis of the initial
Lorentz factor of the giant flare outflow. This component is potentially
detectable by GLAST if a similar giant flare occurs in the GLAST era. With the
available 10 MeV data, we constrain that \Gamma_0 < 50 if the electron
distribution is a single power law. For a broken power law distribution of
electrons, a higher \Gamma_0 is allowed. At energies higher than 1 GeV, the
flux is lower because of a high energy cut off of the synchrotron emission
component. The synchrotron self-Compton emission component and the inverse
Compton scattering component off the photons in the giant flare oscillation
tail are also considered, but they are found not significant given a moderate
\Gamma_0 (e.g. \leq 10). The forward shock also accelerates cosmic rays to the
maximum energy 10^{17}eV, and generate neutrinos with a typical energy
10^{14}eV through photomeson interaction with the X-ray tail photons. However,
they are too weak to be detectable.",2005-05-23T20:47:51Z
"On the Interpretation of High Velocity White Dwarfs as Members of the
  Galactic Halo","A detailed analysis of 32 of the 38 halo white dwarf candidates identified by
Oppenheimer et al. is presented, based on model atmosphere fits to observed
energy distributions built from optical BVRI and infrared JHK CCD photometry.
Effective temperatures and atmospheric compositions are determined for all
objects, as well as masses and cooling ages when trigonometric parallax
measurements are available. This sample is combined with that of other halo
white dwarf candidates and disk white dwarfs to study the nature of these
objects in terms of reduced proper motion diagrams, tangential velocities, and
stellar ages. We reaffirm the conclusions of an earlier analysis based on
photographic magnitudes of the same sample that total stellar ages must be
derived in order to associate a white dwarf with the old halo population, and
that this can only be accomplished through precise mass and distance
determinations.",2005-02-17T14:44:30Z
A changing inner radius in the accretion disc of Q0056-363?,"Q0056-363 is the most powerful X-ray quasar known to exhibit a broad, likely
relativistic iron line (Porquet & Reeves 2003). It has been observed twice by
XMM-$Newton$, three and half years apart (July 2000 and December 2003). In the
second observation, the UV and soft X-ray fluxes were fainter, the hard X-ray
power law flatter, and the iron line equivalent width (EW) smaller than in the
2000 observation. These variations can all be explained, at least
qualitatively, if the disc is truncated in the second observation. We report
also on the possible detection of a transient, redshifted iron absorption line
during the 2003 observation.",2005-02-16T16:50:33Z
The rates of Type Ia Supernovae. I. Analytical Formulations,"This paper provides a handy tool to compute the impact of Type Ia Supernova
(SNIa) on the evolution of stellar systems. An effective formalism is presented
to couple the SNIa rate to the star formation history, which rests upon the
definition of two key properties of the progenitor's model: the realization
probability of the SNIa event from a single stellar generation and the
distribution function of the delay times. It is shown that the current SNIa
rate in late type galaxies implies that the realization probability is on the
order of 0.001. Analytical formulations for the distribution function of the
delay times for Single (SD) and Double Degenerate (DD) progenitors are derived,
based on stellar evolution arguments. These formulations, which agree well with
the results of Monte Carlo simulations for the evolution of close binaries,
have a built in parametrization of the key properties of the alternative
candidates. The various models for the progenitors have different impact on the
large scales. In particular, the paper examines the systematic trend of the
SNIa rate per unit mass with the color of the parent galaxy, and shows that the
recent observations favor the DD model. The SD scenario can reproduce the data
only if the distribution of the primordial mass ratios is flat, and the
accretion efficiency onto the WD is close to 100%. The timescale for the Fe
release from SNIa to the interstellar medium ranges between 0.3 and 3 Gyr for a
wide variety of hypothesis on the SNIa progenitors. (ABRIDGED)",2005-04-18T07:43:21Z
HST/WFPC2 Color-Magnitude Diagrams for Globular Clusters in M31,"We report new HST/WFPC2 photometry for 10 globular clusters (GC) in M31
observed in F5555W(V) and F814W(I). Additionally we have reanalyzed HST
archival data of comparable quality for 2 more GCs. Extraordinary care is taken
to account for the effects of blended stellar images and required field
subtraction. We thus reach 1 mag fainter than the horizontal branch (HB) even
in unfavorable cases. We present the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and
discuss their main features also in comparison with the properties of the
Galactic GCs. This analysis is augmented with CMDs previously obtained and
discussed by Fusi Pecci et al. (1996) on 8 other M31 clusters. We report the
following significant results: 1. The locus of the red giant branches give
reliable metallicity determinations which compare generally very well with
ground-based integrated spectroscopic and photometric measures, as well as
giving good reddening estimates. 2. The HB morphologies show the same behavior
with metallicity as the Galactic GCs, with indications that the 2nd-parameter
effect can be present in some GCs of our sample. However, at [Fe/H] ~ -1.7 we
observe a number of GCs with red HB morphology such that the HB type versus
[Fe/H] relation is offset from the MW and resembles that of the Fornax dwarf
spheroidal galaxy. One explanation for the offset is that they are younger than
their MW counterparts by 1-2 Gyr. 3. The Mv(HB)-[Fe/H] relationship has been
determined and the slope (~0.20) is very similar to the values derived from RR
Lyrae stars in the MW and the LMC. The zero-point of this relation based on the
assumed distance modulus (m-M)o(M31)=24.47+/-0.03 is consistent with
(m-M)o(LMC)=18.55.",2005-02-09T11:22:33Z
Predicted and empirical radii of RR Lyrae stars,"We present new theoretical Period-Radius-Metallicity (PRZ) relations for RR
Lyrae stars. Current predictions are based on a large set of nonlinear,
convective models that cover a broad range of chemical abundances and input
parameters. We also provide new and homogeneous estimates of angular diameters
for a sample of field RR Lyrae stars using a recent calibration of the
Barnes-Evans surface brightness relation. Predicted and empirical radii are,
within the errors, in reasonable agreement, but in the short-period range the
latter present a larger scatter. As a working hypothesis we suggest that this
discrepancy might be due to the occurrence either of nonlinear features such as
bumps or a steep rising branch. New distance determination for RR Lyr itself is
in very good agreement with HST trigonometric parallax and with pulsation
parallax.",2005-03-17T10:37:03Z
"Studying the coincidence excess between EXPLORER and NAUTILUS during
  1998","The coincidences between EXPLORER and NAUTILUS during 1998 (Astone et al.
2001) are more deeply studied. It is found that the coincidence excess is
greater in the ten-day period 7-17 September 1998 and it occurs at the sidereal
hour 4, when the detectors axes are perpendicular to the Galactic Disk. The
purpose of this paper is to bring our results with the GW detectors to the
attention of scientists working in the astrophysical field, and ask them
whether are they aware of any special phenomenon occurring when EXPLORER and
NAUTILUS showed a coincidence excess.",2005-05-30T13:30:13Z
"Effects of Gravitational Microlensing on P-Cygni Profiles of Type Ia
  Supernovae","A brief description of the deformed spectra of microlensed SNe Ia is
presented. We show that microlensing amplification can have significant effects
on line profiles. The resonance-scattering code SYNOW is used to compute the
intensity profile in the rest frame of the supernova. The observed
(microlensed) spectral lines are predicted assuming a simple stellar-size
deflector, and are compared to unlensed cases to show the effects microlensing
by solar-size deflectors can have on spectral lines. We limit our work to
spherically symmetric deflectors.",2005-03-21T22:19:18Z
ISO's Contribution to the Study of Clusters of Galaxies,"Starting with nearby galaxy clusters like Virgo and Coma, and continuing out
to the furthest galaxy clusters for which ISO results have yet been published
($z=0.56$), we discuss the development of knowledge of the infrared and
associated physical properties of galaxy clusters from early IRAS observations,
through the ""ISO-era"" to the present, in order to explore the status of ISO's
contribution to this field. Relevant IRAS and ISO programmes are reviewed,
addressing both the cluster galaxies and the still-very-limited evidence for an
infrared-emitting intra-cluster medium. ISO made important advances in
knowledge of both nearby and distant galaxy clusters, such as the discovery of
a major cold dust component in Virgo and Coma cluster galaxies, the elaboration
of the correlation between dust emission and Hubble-type, and the detection of
numerous Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs) in several distant clusters. These
and consequent achievements are underlined and described. We recall that, due
to observing time constraints, ISO's coverage of higher-redshift galaxy
clusters to the depths required to detect and study statistically significant
samples of cluster galaxies over a range of morphological types could not be
comprehensive and systematic, and such systematic coverage of distant clusters
will be an important achievement of the Spitzer Observatory.",2005-06-17T19:20:27Z
From ISO to Spitzer: a new view of the AGB-PN transition phase,"We present a novel classification scheme for stars evolving in the transition
phase between the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) to the Planetary Nebula (PN)
stage based on the results obtained with ISO-SWS. With the better sensitivity
and higher spatial resolution of Spitzer this analysis can now be extended to a
larger number of sources located in the Galactic Bulge, in the Magellanic
Clouds and in other Galaxies of the Local Group, offering an excellent
opportunity to study the validity of the proposed scheme in environments which
are free of the distance scale bias that hinder the observations made with ISO
on galactic sources located at uncertain distances. The new observations will
be used to test the current evolutionary models which predict the dredge-up of
processed material to the surface of low- and intermediate-mass stars as a
function of the progenitor mass and of the metallicity.",2005-05-24T14:41:50Z
"A microlensing measurement of the size of the broad emission line region
  in the lensed QSO 2237+0305","We present spatially resolved spectroscopic images of the gravitationally
lensed QSO 2237+0305 taken with the GMOS Integral Field Unit (IFU) on the
Gemini North telescope. These observations have the best spatial resolution of
any IFU observations of this object to date and include the redshifted CIII]
and MgII QSO broad lines. Unlike Mediavilla et al. 1998, we find no evidence
for an arc of resolved broad line emission in either the CIII] or MgII lines.
  We calculate the image flux ratios of both the integrated emission lines and
the surrounding continua. The flux ratios of the CIII] and MgII emission lines
are consistent with each other but differ substantially from their
corresponding continuum flux ratios and the radio/mid-IR flux ratios previously
published. We argue that the broad emission line region must be microlensed and
the CIII] and MgII emission regions must be approximately the same size and
co-located along the line-of-sight. Assuming a simple model for the broad
emission line region and the continuum region, we show the size of the CIII] /
MgII broad line region is ~0.06 h_{70}^{1/2} pc and the continuum region is <=
0.02 h_{70}^{1/2} pc.",2005-02-21T00:24:53Z
"On the Afterglow and Host Galaxy of GRB021004: A Comprehensive Study
  with the Hubble Space Telescope","(Abridged) We report on HST observations of the late-time afterglow and host
galaxy of GRB021004 (z=2.33). Although this GRB is one of the best observed so
far, there is substantial disagreement between different interpretations of
data sets on this burst in the literature. We have observed the field of
GRB021004 with the HST at multiple epochs from 3 days until almost 10 months
after the burst. With STIS spectroscopy we cover the spectral region 600-1700AA
in the restframe. From the limit on the flux recovery bluewards of the
Lyman-limit we constrain the HI column density to be above 1x10^18 cm-2 Based
on ACS and NICMOS imaging we find that the afterglow evolved achromatically
within the errors. The color changes observed by other authors during the first
four days must be related to a stochastic phenomenon superimposed on an
afterglow component with a constant spectral shape. This achromaticity implies
that the cooling break has remained on the blue side of the optical part of the
spectrum for at least two weeks after the burst. The optical-to-X-ray slope is
consistent with being the same at 1.4 and 52.4 days after the burst. This
indicates that the cooling frequency is constant and hence, according to
fireball models, that the circumburst medium has a constant density profile.
The late-time slope of the lightcurve is in the range alpha_2 = 1.8-1.9, and is
inconsistent with a single power-law. This could be due to a late-time
flattening caused by the transition to non-relativistic expansion or due to
excess emission (a lightcurve `bump') 7 days after burst. The host is a
starburst galaxy with no evidence for dust and with strong Ly-alpha emission.
The afterglow was located very close (~100 pc) to the center of the host
suggesting that the progenitor was associated with a circumnuclear starburst.",2005-06-05T15:36:40Z
The alpha-effect and current helicity for fast sheared rotators,"We explore the alpha-effect and the small-scale current helicity, for the
case of weakly compressible magnetically driven turbulence that is subjected to
the differential rotation. No restriction is applied to the amplitude of
angular velocity, i.e., the derivations presented are valid for an arbitrary
Coriolis number, though the differential rotation itself is assumed to be weak.
The expressions obtained are used to explore the possible distributions of
alpha-effect and current helicity in convection zones (CZ) of the solar-type
stars. The implications of the obtained results to the mean-field dynamo models
are discussed.",2005-03-04T11:05:40Z
VLT/UVES shows no cosmological variability of alpha,"The cosmological variability of alpha is probed from individual observations
of pairs of FeII lines. This procedure allows a better control of the
systematics and avoids the influence of the spectral shifts due to ionization
inhomogeneities in the absorbers and/or non-zero offsets between different
exposures. Applied to the FeII lines of the metal absorption systems at zabs =
1.839 in Q1101--264 and at zabs = 1.15 in HE0515--4414 observed by means of
UVES at the ESO-VLT, it provides da/a = 0.4 (+/- 1.5 stat)x10^{-6}. The result
is shifted with respect to the Keck/HIRES mean da/a = -5.7(+/- 1.1

details of this work are given in Levshakov et al (2005)",2005-05-05T08:12:18Z
"Surface imaging of late-type contact binaries II: Halpha 6563 A emission
  in AE Phoenicis and YY Eridani","We present and discuss the Halpha (6563 A) observations of the contact (W UMa
type) binaries AE Phoenicis and YY Eridani, obtaineded in 1989, 1990 and 1995
with the CAT/CES telescope of the Southern European Observatory (ESO). In
particular, we compare the intrinsic equivalent widths of both components with
the NextGen theoretical models and the saturation limit. We find that the
average Halpha equivalent widths are close to the saturation border and that
the primary components have excess Halpha-emission, indicating enhanced
chromospheric activity. This is compatible with both theoretical and
observational suggestions that the primary is the more magnetically active
component and is filled with (mostly unresolvable) dark spots and associated
chromospheric plages.",2005-03-24T16:21:31Z
"SCUBA sub-millimeter observations of gamma-ray bursters IV. GRB 021004,
  021211, 030115, 030226, 041006","We discuss our ongoing program of Target of Opportunity (ToO) sub-millimeter
observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) using the Sub-millimetre Common-User
Bolometer Array (SCUBA) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). In this
paper, we present the ToO observations of GRBs 021004, 021211, 030115, 030226,
and 041006. The observations of GRBs 021004, 021211, 030226, and 041006 all
started within ~1 day of the burst, but did not detect any significant
sub-millimeter emission from the reverse shock and/or afterglow. These
observations put some constraints on the models for the early emission,
although the generally poor observing conditions and/or the faintness of these
afterglows at other wavelengths limit the inferences that can be drawn from
these lack of detections. However, these observations demonstrate that SCUBA
can perform rapid observations of GRBs, and provide encouragement for future
observations in the Swift era. None of these GRBs had significant
sub-millimeter emission from their host galaxies. This adds to the indication
that GRBs are not closely linked to the most luminous dusty star-forming
galaxies.",2005-03-26T00:28:49Z
"Identification of 13 DB + dM and 2 DC + dM binaries from the Sloan

from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Before the SDSS only 2 DB + dM
binaries and 1 DC + dM binary were known. At least three, possibly 8, of the
new DB + dM binaries seem to have white dwarf temperatures well above 30000 K
which would place them in the so called DB-gap. Finding these DB white dwarfs
in binaries may suggest that they have formed through a different evolutionary
channel than the ones in which DA white dwarfs transform into DB white dwarfs
due to convection in the upper layers.",2005-03-23T10:28:45Z
"The Birthplace of Low-Mass X-ray Binaries: Field Versus Globular Cluster
  Populations","Recent Chandra studies of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) within early-type
galaxies have found that LMXBs are commonly located within globular clusters of
the galaxies. However, whether all LMXBs are formed within globular clusters
has remained an open question. If all LMXBs formed within globular clusters,
the summed X-ray luminosity of the LMXBs in a galaxy should be directly
proportional to the number of globular clusters in the galaxy regardless of
where the LMXBs currently reside. We have compared these two quantities over
the same angular area for a sample of 12 elliptical and S0 galaxies observed
with Chandra and found that the correlation between the two quantities is
weaker than expected if all LMXBs formed within globular clusters. This
indicates that a significant number of the LMXBs were formed in the field, and
naturally accounts for the spread in field-to-cluster fractions of LMXBs from
galaxy to galaxy. We also find that the ""pollution"" of globular cluster LMXBs
into the field has been minimal within elliptical galaxies, but there is
evidence that roughly half of the LMXBs originally in the globular clusters of
S0 galaxies in our sample have escaped into the field. This is due to higher
globular cluster disruption rates in S0s resulting from stronger gravitational
shocks caused by the passage of globular clusters through the disks of S0
galaxies that are absent in elliptical galaxies.",2005-06-09T20:00:04Z
Applications of Bayesian model selection to cosmological parameters,"Bayesian model selection is a tool to decide whether the introduction of a
new parameter is warranted by data. I argue that the usual sampling statistic
significance tests for a null hypothesis can be misleading, since they do not
take into account the information gained through the data, when updating the
prior distribution to the posterior. On the contrary, Bayesian model selection
offers a quantitative implementation of Occam's razor.
  I introduce the Savage-Dickey density ratio, a computationally quick method
to determine the Bayes factor of two nested models and hence perform model
selection. As an illustration, I consider three key parameters for our
understanding of the cosmological concordance model. By using WMAP 3-year data
complemented by other cosmological measurements, I show that a non-scale
invariant spectral index of perturbations is favoured for any sensible choice
of prior. It is also found that a flat Universe is favoured with odds of 29:1
over non--flat models, and that there is strong evidence against a CDM
isocurvature component to the initial conditions which is totally
(anti)correlated with the adiabatic mode (odds of about 2000:1), but that this
is strongly dependent on the prior adopted.
  These results are contrasted with the analysis of WMAP 1-year data, which
were not informative enough to allow a conclusion as to the status of the
spectral index. In a companion paper, a new technique to forecast the Bayes
factor of a future observation is presented.",2005-04-01T13:14:46Z
"Magnetic deflections and possible sources of the ultra-high-energy
  cosmic rays in the AGASA-HiRes-Yakutsk cluster","The cluster of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays observed by the AGASA, HiRes and
Yakutsk experiments is studied with respect to possible deflections of
particles in regular magnetic fields. Best-fit positions of a potential source
of these clustered particles are found, with account of the errors in energy
estimation, both in the frameworks of particular models of the Galactic
magnetic field and treating the direction and the amount of deflection as free
parameters. The study suggests that an unknown regular component of either
Galactic or extragalactic magnetic field may dominate over modelled components
in the direction of the cluster. Possible sources of the cosmic rays in that
direction are considered.",2005-05-12T15:59:47Z
The first WIMPy halos,"Dark matter direct and indirect detection signals depend crucially on the
dark matter distribution. While the formation of large scale structure is
independent of the nature of the cold dark matter (CDM), the fate of
inhomogeneities on sub-galactic scales, and hence the present day CDM
distribution on these scales, depends on the micro-physics of the CDM
particles. We study the density contrast of Weakly Interacting Massive
Particles (WIMPs) on sub-galactic scales. We calculate the damping of the
primordial power spectrum due to collisional damping and free-streaming of
WIMPy CDM and show that free-streaming leads to a CDM power spectrum with a
sharp cut-off at about $10^{-6} M_\odot$. We also calculate the transfer
function for the growth of the inhomogeneities in the linear regime, taking
into account the suppression in the growth of the CDM density contrast after
matter-radiation equality due to baryons and show that our analytic results are
in good agreement with numerical calculations. Combining the transfer function
with the damping of the primordial fluctuations we produce a WMAP normalized
primordial CDM power spectrum, which can serve as an input for high resolution
CDM simulations. We find that the smallest inhomogeneities typically have
co-moving radius of about 1 pc and enter the non-linear regime at a redshift of
$60 \pm 20$. We study the effect of scale dependence of the primordial power
spectrum on these numbers and also use the spherical collapse model to make
simple estimates of the properties of the first generation of WIMP halos to
form. We find that the very first WIMPy halos may have a significant impact on
indirect dark matter searches.",2005-03-17T13:10:30Z
"Hubble Space Telescope Imaging of Globular Cluster Candidates in Low
  Surface Brightness Dwarf Galaxies","Fifty-seven nearby low surface brightness dwarf galaxies were searched for
globular cluster candidates (GCCs) using Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 imaging
in V and I. The sample consists of 18 dwarf spheroidal (dSph), 36 irregular
(dIrr), and 3 ""transition"" type (dIrr/dSph) galaxies with angular sizes less
than 3.7 kpc situated at distances 2-6 Mpc in the field and in the nearby
groups: M81, Centaurus A, Sculptor, Canes Venatici I cloud. We find that ~50%
of dSph, dIrr/dSph, and dIrr galaxies contain GCCs. The fraction of GCCs
located near the center of dwarf spheroidal galaxies is >2 times higher than
that for dIrrs. The mean integral color of GCCs in dSphs, V-I = 1.04+/-0.16
mag, coincides with the corresponding value for Galactic globular clusters and
is similar to the blue globular cluster sub-populations in massive early-type
galaxies. The color distribution for GCCs in dIrrs shows a clear bimodality
with peaks near V-I = 0.5 and 1.0 mag. Blue GCCs are presumably young with ages
t < 1 Gyr, while the red GCC population is likely to be older. The detected
GCCs have absolute visual magnitudes between M_V = -10 and -5 mag. We find
indications for an excess population of faint GCCs with M_V > -6.5 mag in both
dSph and dIrr galaxies, reminiscent of excess populations of faint globular
clusters in nearby Local Group spiral galaxies. The measurement of structural
parameters using King-profile fitting reveals that most GCCs have structural
parameters similar to extended outer halo globular clusters in the Milky Way
and M31, as well as the recently discovered population of ""faint fuzzy""
clusters in nearby lenticular galaxies.",2005-05-31T15:08:24Z
"Probing the largest scale structure in the universe with polarization
  map of galaxy clusters","We introduce a new formalism to describe the polarization signal of galaxy
clusters on the whole sky. We show that a sparsely sampled, half-sky map of the
cluster polarization signal at $z\sim 1$ would allow to better characterize the
very large scale density fluctuations. While the horizon length is smaller in
the past, two other competing effects significantly remove the contribution of
the small scale fluctuations from the quadrupole polarization pattern at $z\sim
1$. For the standard Lambda-CDM universe with vanishing tensor mode, the
quadrupole moment of the temperature anisotropy probed by WMAP is expected to
have a ~32% contribution from fluctuations on scales below 6.3h^{-1}Gpc. This
percentage would be reduced to ~2% level for the quadrupole moment of
polarization pattern at $z\sim 1$. A cluster polarization map at $z \sim 1$
would shed light on the potentially anomalous features of the largest scale
structure in the observable universe.",2005-02-28T01:14:59Z
"VLA Polarimetry Observations of PKS 2322-123; Estimating Magnetic Fields
  in the Abell 2597 Cluster","We present 5, 8, and 15 GHz total intensity and polarimetric observations of
the radio source PKS 2322-123 taken with the Very Large Array (VLA). This small
(11 kpc) source is located at the center of the cooling-core cluster Abell
2597. The inner X-ray structure, the radio morphology, and the steep spectral
index (alpha = -1.8) in the lobes, all suggest that the radio emission is
confined by the ambient X-ray gas. We detect a small region of polarized flux
in the southern lobe and are able to calculate a Faraday rotation measure (RM)
of 3620 rad/m/m over this region. Based on these observations and Chandra X-ray
data we suggest that the southern lobe has been deflected from its original
southwestern orientation to the south and into our line-of-sight. Using the
observed RMs and our calculated electron density profiles, and assuming both a
uniform and tangled magnetic field topology, we estimate a lower limit of the
line-of-sight cluster magnetic field, B = 2.1 microgauss.",2005-03-10T22:41:10Z
Non-thermal radio emission from O-type stars. I. HD 168112,"We present a radio lightcurve of the O5.5 III(f+) star HD 168112, based on
archive data from the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Australia Telescope
Compact Array (ATCA). The fluxes show considerable variability and a negative
spectral index, thereby confirming that HD 168112 is a non-thermal radio
emitter. The non-thermal radio emission is believed to be due to synchrotron
radiation from relativistic electrons that have been Fermi accelerated in
shocks. For HD 168112, it is not known whether these shocks are due to a
wind-wind collision in a binary system or to the intrinsic instability of the
stellar wind driving mechanism. Assuming HD 168112 to be a single star, our
synchrotron model shows that the velocity jump of the shocks should be very
high, or there should be a very large number of shocks in the wind. Neither of
these is compatible with time-dependent hydrodynamical calculations of O star
winds. If, on the other hand, we assume that HD 168112 is a binary, the high
velocity jump is easily explained by ascribing it to the wind-wind collision.
By further assuming the star to be an eccentric binary, we can explain the
observed radio variability by the colliding-wind region moving in and out of
the region where free-free absorption is important. The radio data presented
here show that the binary has a period between one and two years. By combining
the radio data with X-ray data, we find that the most likely period is about
1.4 yr.",2005-02-22T15:14:35Z
"Relation between the 16O(alpha,gamma)20Ne reaction and its reverse
  20Ne(gamma,alpha)16O reaction in stars and in the laboratory","The astrophysical reaction rates of the 16O(a,g)20Ne capture reaction and its
inverse 20Ne(g,a)16O photodisintegration reaction are given by the sum of
several narrow resonances and a small direct capture contribution at low
temperatures. Although the thermal population of low lying excited states in
16O and 20Ne is extremely small, the first excited state in 20Ne plays a
non-negligible role for the photodisintegration rate. Consequences for
experiments with so-called quasi-thermal photon energy distributions are
discussed.",2005-06-05T07:53:30Z
"The Molecular ISM of Dwarf Galaxies on Kiloparsec Scales: A New Survey
  for CO in Northern, IRAS-detected Dwarf Galaxies","We present a new survey for CO in dwarf galaxies using the Kitt Peak 12m
telescope. We observed the central regions of 121 northern dwarfs with IRAS
detections and no known CO emission. We detect CO in 28 of these galaxies and
marginally detect another 16, increasing by about 50% the number of such
galaxies known to have significant CO emission. The galaxies we detect are
comparable in mass to the LMC, although somewhat brighter in CO and fainter in
the FIR. Within dwarfs, we find that the CO luminosity, L_CO, is most strongly
correlated with the K-band and the far infrared luminosities. There are also
strong correlations with the radio continuum and B-band luminosities, and
linear diameter. We suggest that L_CO and L_K correlate well because the
stellar component of a galaxy dominates the midplane gravitational field and
thus sets the pressure of the atomic gas, which controls the formation of H_2
from HI. We compare our sample with more massive galaxies and find that dwarfs
and large galaxies obey the same relationship between CO and the 1.4 GHz radio
continuum (RC) surface brightness. This relationship is well described by a
Schmidt Law with Sigma_RC proportional to Sigma_CO^1.3. Therefore, dwarf
galaxies and large spirals exhibit the same relationship between molecular gas
and star formation rate (SFR). We find that this result is robust to moderate
changes in the RC-to-SFR and CO-to-H_2 conversion factors. Our data appear to
be inconsistent with large (order of magnitude) variations in the CO-to-H_2
conversion factor in the star forming molecular gas. [abridged]",2005-02-15T21:10:38Z
Do Large-Scale Inhomogeneities Explain Away Dark Energy?,"Recently, new arguments (astro-ph/0501152, hep-th/0503117) for how
corrections from super-Hubble modes can explain the present-day acceleration of
the universe have appeared in the literature. However, in this letter, we argue
that, to second order in spatial gradients, these corrections only amount to a
renormalization of local spatial curvature, and thus cannot account for the
negative deceleration. Moreover, cosmological observations already put severe
bounds on such corrections, at the level of a few percent, while in the context
of inflationary models, these corrections are typically limited to ~ 10^{-5}.
Currently there is no general constraint on the possible correction from higher
order gradient terms, but we argue that such corrections are even more
constrained in the context of inflationary models.",2005-03-25T01:31:33Z
Projection of circumstellar disks on their environments,"We use a 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code to study the projection of
large shadows by circumstellar disks around young stellar objects on
surrounding reflection nebulosity. It is shown that for a wide range of
parameters a small (10-100 AU) circumstellar disk can project a large (1 000-10
000 AU) dark band in the near-infrared that often resembles a massive edge-on
disk. The disk shadows are divided into two basic types, depending on the
distribution of the reflecting material and the resulting morphology of the
shadows in the near-infrared. Two YSOs associated with bipolar nebulosity, CK
3/EC 82 illuminating the Serpens Reflection Nebula (SRN) and Ced 110 IRS 4 in
the Chamaeleon I molecular cloud, are modelled in detail as disk shadows.
Spectral energy distributions of the two sources are collected using both
archival ISO data and new Spitzer-IRS data. An axisymmetric model consisting of
a small disk and a spherically symmetric envelope can reproduce the
near-infrared images and full spectral energy distributions of the two disk
shadow candidates. It is shown that the model fits can be used to constrain the
geometry of the central disks due to the magnifying effect of the projection.
We find that a disk unresolved in near-infrared images, but casting a large
disk shadow, can be modelled at a level of sophistication approaching that of
an edge-on disk with resolved near-infrared images. It is found that the most
obvious observable difference between a disk shadow and a large optically thick
disk is that the disk shadows have a compact near-infrared source near the
center of the dark band. High resolution imaging and/or polarimetry should
reveal the compact source in the center of a disk shadow as an edge-on disk.

"The supernova rate-velocity dispersion relation in the interstellar
  medium","We investigate the relationship between the velocity dispersion of the gas
and the SN rate and feedback efficiency in the ISM. We explore the constancy of
the velocity dispersion profiles in the outer parts of galactic disks at~6-8 km
s^-1, and the transition to the starburst regime. Our results show that a) SN
driving leads to constant velocity dispersions of sig~6 km s^-1 for the total
gas and sigHI~3 km s^-1 for the HI gas, independent of the SN rate, for values
of the rate between 0.01-0.5 the Galactic rate R_{G},b) the position of the
transition to the starburst regime at SFR/Area~5*10^-3-10^-2 M_sol yr^-1 kpc^-2
observed in the simulations, is in good agreement with the transition to the
starburst regime in the observations, c) for the high SN rates, no HI gas is
present in the simulations box, however, for the total gas velocity dispersion,
there is good agreement between the models and the observations,d) at the
intermediate SN rates R/R_{G}~0.5-1, taking into account the thermal broadening
of the HI line helps reach a good agreement in that regime between the models
and the observations,e) for R/R_{G}<0.5, sig and sigHI fall below the observed
values by a factor of~2. However, a set of simulation with different values of
epsilon indicates that for larger values of the supernova feedback
efficiencies, velocity dispersions of the HI gas of the order of 5-6 km s^{-1}
can be obtained, in closer agreement with the observations. The fact that for
R/R_{G}<0.5, the HI gas velocity dispersions are a factor ~2 smaller than the
observed values could result from the fact that we might have underestimated
the SN feedback efficiency. It might also be an indication that other physical
processes couple to the stellar feedback in order to produce the observed level
of turbulence in galactic disks.",2005-06-15T11:41:04Z
"Dissipationless Mergers of Elliptical Galaxies and the Evolution of the
  Fundamental Plane","We carry out numerical simulations of dissipationless major mergers of
elliptical galaxies using initial galaxy models that consist of a dark matter
halo and a stellar bulge with properties consistent with the observed
fundamental plane. By varying the density profile of the dark matter halo
(standard NFW versus adiabatically contracted NFW), the global stellar to dark
matter mass ratio, and the orbit of the merging galaxies, we are able to assess
the impact of each of these factors on the structure of the merger remnant. Our
results indicate that the properties of the remnant bulge depend primarily on
the angular momentum and energy of the orbit; for a cosmologically motivated
orbit, the effective radius and velocity dispersion of the remnant bulge remain
approximately on the fundamental plane. This indicates that the observed
properties of elliptical galaxies are consistent with significant growth via
late dissipationless mergers. We also find that the dark matter fraction within
the effective radius of our remnants increases after the merger, consistent
with the hypothesis that the tilt of the fundamental plane from the virial
theorem is due to a varying dark matter fraction as a function of galaxy mass.",2005-02-24T19:45:44Z
The EUV variability of the luminous QSO HS 1700+6416,"We report on the first observations of variations in UV (intrinsic EUV 330 A)
flux of the luminous QSO HS 1700+6416 (z=2.72) over a decade. The amplitude of
variations increases from +/-0.1 mag in the optical (R) to up to a factor of 3
at 1250 A. This is apparently an extension of the increase in amplitude of
variations towards shorter wavelengths observed with IUE in low z AGN (Paltani
& Courvoisier, 1996) to the EUV. The time-scale for variations with the largest
amplitudes is >= 1/2 yr to years. We briefly discuss the consequences of the
observed variations on the ionizing metagalactic UV background.",2005-04-01T07:52:30Z
Slinky Inflation,"We present a new approach to quintessential inflation, in which both dark
energy and inflation are explained by the evolution of a single scalar field.
We start from a simple scalar potential with both oscillatory and exponential
behavior. We employ the conventional reheating mechanism of new inflation, in
which the scalar decays to light fermions with a decay width that is
proportional to the scalar mass. Because our scalar mass is proportional to the
Hubble rate, this gives adequate reheating at early times while shutting off at
late times to preserve quintessence and satisfy nucleosynthesis constraints.
  We discuss a simple model which solves the horizon, flatness, and ""why now""
problems. Without any additional tuning of parameters, this model satisfies all
constraints from CMB, large scale structure, and nucleosynthesis. The
predictions for the inflationary spectral indices are n_S = n_T = 1. In this
model we are currently beginning the third cosmic epoch of accelerated
expansion.",2005-04-05T15:18:46Z
"Discovery of a Large ~200 kpc Gaseous Nebula at z=2.7 with the Spitzer
  Space Telescope","We report the discovery of a very large, spatially extended Ly alpha
-emitting nebula at z=2.656 associated with a luminous mid-infrared source. The
bright mid-infrared source (F(24um)=0.86 mJy) was first detected in
observations made using the Spitzer Space Telescope. Existing broad-band
imaging data from the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey revealed the mid-infrared
source to be associated with a diffuse, spatially extended, optical counterpart
in the Bw band. Spectroscopy and further imaging of this target reveals that
the optical source is an almost purely line-emitting nebula with little, if
any, detectable diffuse continuum emission. The Lya nebula has a luminosity of
L[Lya] ~ 1.7e44 erg/s and an extent of at least 20 arcsec (160 kpc). Its
central ~8 arcsec shows an ordered, monotonic velocity profile; interpreted as
rotation, this region encloses a mass M = 6e12 Msun. Several sources lie within
the nebula. The central region of the nebula shows narrow (~365 km/s) emission
lines of CIV and HeII. The mid-infrared source is a compact object lying within
the nebula, but offset from the center by a projected distance of ~2.5 arcsec
(20 kpc), and likely to be an enshrouded AGN. A young star-forming galaxy lies
near the northern end of the nebula. We suggest that the nebula is a site of
recent multiple galaxy and AGN formation, with the spatial distribution of
galaxies within the nebula perhaps tracking the formation history of the
system.",2005-03-29T21:13:01Z
A near-infrared survey for new low-mass members in Alpha Per,"We present a near-infrared (K'-band) survey of 0.7 square degree area in the
Alpha Persei open cluster (age = 90 Myr, distance = 182 pc) carried out with
the Omega-Prime camera on the Calar Alto 3.5-m telescope. Combining optical
data (Rc and Ic) obtained with the KPNO/MOSA detector and presented in Stauffer
et al. (1999) with the K' observations, a sample of new candidate members has
been extracted from the optical-infrared colour-magnitude diagram. The location
of these candidates in the colour-colour diagram suggests that two-thirds of
them are actually reddened background giants. About 20 new candidate members
with masses between 0.3 and 0.04 Msun are added to the 400 known Alpha Per
cluster members. If they are indeed Alpha Per members, four of the new
candidates would be brown dwarfs. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks of
the near-infrared survey as compared to the optical selection method. We also
describe the outcome of optical spectroscopy obtained with the Twin
spectrograph on the Calar Alto 3.5-m telescope for about 30 candidates,
including selected members from the optical sample presented in Barrado y
Navascues et al. (2002) and from our joint optical/infrared catalogue. These
results argue in favour of the optical selection method for this particular
cluster.",2005-02-22T10:53:51Z
"Evidence for Companion-Induced Secular Changes in the Turbulent Disk of
  a Be Star in the LMC MACHO Database","The light curve of a blue variable in the MACHO LMC database (FTS ID
78.5979.72) appeared nearly unvarying for ~4 years (quasi-flat segment) but
then rapidly changed to become periodic with noisy minima for the remaining 4
years (periodic segment); there are no antecedent indications of a gradual
approach to this change. Lomb Periodogram analyses indicate the presence of two
distinct periods of ~61 days and 8 days in both the quasi-flat and the periodic
segments. Minima of the periodic segment cover at least 50% of the orbital
period and contain spikes of light with the 8-day period; maxima do not show
this short period. The system typically shows maxima to be redder than minima.
The most recent OGLE-III light curve shows only a 30-day periodicity. The
variable's V and R magnitudes and color are those of a Be star, and recent sets
of near infrared spectra four days apart, secured during the time of the
OGLE-III data, show H-alpha emission near and at a maximum, confirming its Be
star characteristics. The model that best fits the photometric behavior
consists of a thin ring-like circumstellar disk of low mass with four obscuring
sectors orbiting the central B star in unison at the 61-day period. The central
star peers through the three equi- spaced separations between the four sectors
producing the 8-day period. The remainder of the disk contains hydrogen in
emission making maxima appear redder. A companion star of lower mass in an
inclined and highly eccentric orbit produces an impulsive perturbation near its
periastron to change the disk's orientation, changing eclipses from partial to
complete within ~ 10 days.",2005-03-03T21:27:30Z
"A Coherent Timing Solution for the Nearby Isolated Neutron Star RX
  J0720.4-3125","We present the results of a dedicated effort to measure the spin-down rate of
the nearby isolated neutron star RX J0720.4-3125. Comparing arrival times of
the 8.39-sec pulsations for data from Chandra we derive an unambiguous timing
solution for RX J0720.4-3125 that is accurate to <0.1 cycles over >5 years.
Adding data from XMM and ROSAT, the final solution yields
Pdot=(6.98+/-0.02)x10^(-14) s/s; for dipole spin-down, this implies a
characteristic age of 2 Myr and a magnetic field strength of 2.4e13 G. The
phase residuals are somewhat larger than those for purely regular spin-down,
but do not show conclusive evidence for higher-order terms or a glitch. From
our timing solution as well as recent X-ray spectroscopy, we concur with recent
suggestions that RX J0720.4-3125 is most likely an off-beam radio pulsar with a
moderately high magnetic field.",2005-06-17T16:43:03Z
"Organic Molecules in the Hot Corinos and Circumstellar Disks of IRAS
  16293-2422","Using the recently-commissioned Submillimeter Array (SMA), we have detected
several complex organic molecules, including (CH3)2O, C2H5OH, C2H5CN, and
tentatively CH2CDCN, toward the protostellar hot cores of IRAS 16293-2422 at
arcsecond-resolution (~< 400 AU in radius). Vibrationally excited transitions
of SO, SO2 and HCN with energy levels up to 1800 K were also observed. In
addition to the other organic molecules (HC3N, CH2CO, CH3OH, CH2CHCN and
HCOOCH3) previously reported by us (Kuan et al. 2004), these results clearly
indicate the existence of a rich organic chemistry in low-mass `hot corinos'.
  From the observation of optically thin HC15N emission, we conclude I16293A is
a rotating circumstellar disk lying along the north-south direction ~10 deg to
the east and with an inclination ~30 deg to the sky. We suggest that the
observed vibrational SO and SO2 emission may originate from shock waves near or
in the circumstellar disks. Between the two cores, we find a strong
anticorrelation in emission from C2H5OH and C2H5CN. The relative contribution
of gas phase and grain-surface chemistries to the production of the observed
complex molecules is discussed. We point out the shortcomings underlying recent
claims that all the O-bearing organics are formed on grains.
  The presence of so many well-known interstellar molecules in solar-type hot
corinos strengthens the link between molecular cloud chemistry, the starting
materials of protoplanetary disks such as the protosolar nebula, and the
composition of comets. Establishing the fine details of this connection is
crucial in answering fundamental questions concerning the importance of
galactic astrochemistry for astrobiology.",2005-04-12T14:06:20Z
"New Low Accretion-Rate Magnetic Binary Systems and their Significance
  for the Evolution of Cataclysmic Variables","Discoveries of two new white dwarf plus M star binaries with striking optical
cyclotron emission features from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) brings to
six the total number of X-ray faint, magnetic accretion binaries that accrete
at rates < 10^{-13} Msun/yr, or <1% of the values normally encountered in
cataclysmic variables. This fact, coupled with donor stars that underfill their
Roche lobes and very cool white dwarfs, brand the binaries as post
common-envelope systems whose orbits have not yet decayed to the point of
Roche-lobe contact. They are pre-magnetic CVs, or pre-Polars. The systems
exhibit spin/orbit synchronism and apparently accrete by efficient capture of
the stellar wind from the secondary star, a process that has been dubbed a
``magnetic siphon''. Because of this, period evolution of the binaries will
occur solely by gravitational radiation, which is very slow for periods >3 hr.
Optical surveys for the cyclotron harmonics appear to be the only means of
discovery, so the space density of pre-Polars could rival that of Polars, and
the binaries provide an important channel of progenitors (in addition to the
asynchronous Intermediate Polars). Both physical and SDSS observational
selection effects are identified that may help to explain the clumping of all
six systems in a narrow range of magnetic field strength around 60 MG.",2005-05-18T17:38:28Z
"Dark galaxies or tidal debris? Kinematical clues to the origin of
  massive isolated HI clouds","An extended HI cloud (VIRGOHI 21) with an HI mass of $\sim10^8$ M$_{\odot}$
and no apparent optical counterpart was recently discovered in the Virgo
cluster. In order to understand the origin of physical properties of apparently
isolated HI clouds like the VIRGOHI21, we numerically investigate physical
properties of tidal HI debris that were formed by galaxy-galaxy interaction in
clusters of galaxies. Our hydrodynamical simulations demonstrate that tidal
debris with total HI masses of $10^8-10^9$ M$_{\odot}$ can have (1) wide HI
velocity widths ($>200$ km s$^{-1}$), (2) a small mass fraction of stars
($\sim$10%), and (3) a mean $B$-band surface brightness of the stellar
components fainter than 30 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. These results suggest that the
VIRGOHI21, which lies at a projected distance of $\sim$ 150 kpc from the
one-armed, HI-rich spiral galaxy M99 (NGC 4254), is tidal debris. We propose
that the comparison between the simulated and the observed velocity fields of
HI clouds allows us to better understand their nature and origin (e.g., whether
they are just tidal debris or ``dark galaxies'' that have HI gas only and are
embedded by dark matter halos). We also discuss the timescales for isolated HI
gas to be evaporated by thermal conduction of the hot intracluster gas.",2005-05-29T09:56:21Z
Six detached white-dwarf close binaries,"We determine the orbits of four double degenerate systems (DDs), composed of
two white dwarfs, and of two white dwarf -- M dwarf binaries. The four DDs,
WD1022+050, WD1428+373, WD1824+040, and WD2032+188, show orbital periods of
1.157155(5) d, 1.15674(2) d, 6.26602(6) d and 5.0846(3) d respectively. These
periods combined with estimates for the masses of the brighter component, based
on their effective temperatures, allow us to constrain the masses of the unseen
companions. We estimate that the upper limit for the contribution of the unseen
companions to the total luminosity in the four DDs ranges between 10 and 20 per
cent. In the case of the two white dwarf - M dwarf binaries, WD1042-690 and
WD2009+622, we calculate the orbital parameters by fitting simultaneously the
absorption line from the white dwarf and the emission core from the M-dwarf.
Their orbital periods are 0.337083(1) d and 0.741226(2) d respectively. We find
signatures of irradiation on the inner face of WD2009+622's companion. We
calculate the masses of both components from the gravitational redshift and the
mass-radius relationship for white dwarfs and find masses of 0.75 -- 0.78 Msun
and 0.61 -- 0.64 Msun for WD1042-690 and WD2009+622 respectively. This
indicates that the stars probably reached the asymptotic giant branch in their
evolution before entering a common envelope phase. These two white dwarf - M
dwarf binaries will become cataclysmic variables, although not within a Hubble
time, with orbital periods below the period gap.",2005-02-21T13:17:49Z
"Spectroscopic classification of red high proper motion objects in the
  Southern Sky","We present the results of spectroscopic follow-up observations for a sample
of 71 red objects with high proper motions in the range 0.08-1.14 arcsec/yr as
detected using APM and SSS measurements of multi-epoch photographic Schmidt
plates. Red objects were selected by combining the photographic BjRI magnitudes
with 2MASS near-infrared JHKs magnitudes. Some 50 of the 71 spectroscopically
classified objects turn out to be late-type (>M6) dwarfs and in more detail,
the sample includes 35 ultracool dwarfs with spectral types between M8 and L2,
some previously reported, as well as five M-type subdwarfs, including a cool
esdM6 object, SSSPM J0500-5406. Distance estimates based on the spectral types
and 2MASS J magnitudes place almost all of the late-type (>M6) dwarfs within 50
pc, with 25 objects located inside the 25 pc limit of the catalogue of nearby
stars. Most of the early-type M dwarfs are located at larger distances of
100-200 pc, suggesting halo kinematics for some of them. All objects with
Halpha equivalent widths larger than 10 Angstroms have relatively small
tangential velocities (<50 km/s). Finally, some late-type but blue objects are
candidate binaries.",2005-06-11T22:19:41Z
Is the `IR Coincidence' Just That?,"(Abridged) Motch (1985) suggested that in the hard state of GX 339-4 the soft
X-ray power-law extrapolated backward in energy agrees with the IR flux. Corbel
& Fender (2002) showed that the hard state radio power-law extrapolated forward
in energy meets the extrapolated X-ray power-law at an IR break, which was
explicitly observed twice in GX 339-4. This `IR coincidence' has been cited as
further evidence that a jet might make a significant contribution to the X-rays
in hard state systems. We explore this hypothesis with a series of simultaneous
radio/X-ray observations of GX 339-4, taken during its 1997, 1999, and 2002
hard states. We fit these spectra, in detector space, with a simple, but
remarkably successful, doubly broken power-law that requires an IR spectral
break. For these observations, the break position and the integrated radio/IR
flux have stronger dependences upon the X-rays than the simplest jet
predictions. If one allows for a softening of the X-ray power law with
increasing flux, then the jet model agrees with the correlation. We also find
evidence that the radio/X-ray fcorrelation previously observed in GX 339-4
shows a `parallel track' for the 2002 hard state. The slope of the 2002
correlation is consistent with prior observations; however, the radio amplitude
is reduced. We then examine the correlation in Cyg X-1 through the use of radio
data, obtained with the Ryle radio telescope, and RXTE data, from the ASM and
pointed observations. We again find evidence of `parallel tracks', and here
they are associated with `failed transitions' to the soft state. We also find
that for Cyg X-1 the radio flux is more fundamentally correlated with the hard
X-ray flux.",2005-03-16T02:40:09Z
Massive Stars and their Compact Remnants in High-mass X-ray Binaries,"In a high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) a massive star interacts with a
neutron-star or black-hole companion in various ways. The gravitational
interaction enables the measurement of fundamental parameters such as the mass
of both binary components, providing important constraints on the evolutionary
history of the system, the equation of state of matter at supra-nuclear
density, and the supernova mechanism. The stellar wind of the massive star is
intercepted by the strong gravitational field of the compact companion, giving
rise to the production of X-rays. The X-rays increase the degree of ionization
in a small to very extended region of the surrounding stellar wind, depending
on the X-ray luminosity. This has observable consequences for the structure and
dynamics of the accretion flow. In this paper we concentrate on the fundamental
paramaters of the most massive HMXBs, i.e. those with an OB supergiant
companion, including some systems exhibiting relativistic jets
(``microquasars'').",2005-02-16T12:29:29Z
"The Rise of Dwarfs and the Fall of Giants: Galaxy Formation Feedback
  Signatures in the Halo Satellite Luminosity Function","The observed luminosity function (LF) of satellite galaxies shows several
interesting features that require a better understanding of gas-thermodynamic
processes and feedback effects related to reionization and galaxy formation. In
galaxy clusters, the abundance of dwarf galaxies is in good agreement with the
expectation based on the subhalo mass function, whereas in galaxy groups, the
relatively small abundance of dwarfs conflicts with theoretical expectations.
In all halo systems, there is a dip in the abundance of galaxies with
luminosities in the range ~ 2x10^8 L_sun to 10^10 L_sun, corresponding to
subhalo mass scales between ~ 5x10^10 M_sun to few times 10^11 M_sun.
Photoionization from reionization has been used to explain statistics of the
dwarf population, with larger systems forming prior to, and smaller systems
forming subsequent to, reionization. The observed dip in the LF is an imprint
of small dwarf galaxies (<2x10^8 L_sun) that formed prior to reionization. The
galactic winds powered by supernovae in these dwarf galaxies propagate energy
and metals to large distances such that the intergalactic medium is uniformly
enriched to a level of 10^-3 zsun, as observed in the low-redshift Ly-alpha
forest. The associated energy related to this metallicity raises the
intergalactic medium temperature and the Jeans mass to a range 10^10-10^11
M_sun at z ~ 3.4-6.0. Because the epoch of nonlinearity for halos in this mass
range is at z > 3.4-4.4, their gas content, hence star formation, is greatly
suppressed on average and leads to a dip in the observed LF at $z=0$. Larger
halos (M > 10^11 M_sun), becoming nonlinear at z < 3.4-4.4, have masses topping
the Jeans mass, where subhalo mass function based LF is again in agreement with
observations.",2005-06-19T05:48:24Z
Delayed Afterglow Onset Interpreted as Baryon-Poor Viewing Angle,"We have suggested previously that baryons in GRB fireballs infiltrate from
the surrounding walls that collimate the fireball. The efficiency $\epsilon_b$
for generating blast energy can then be angle dependent. Delayed onset of
afterglow can be interpreted as being due to a baryon-poor viewing angle.",2005-03-24T13:09:50Z
"A Mid-Infrared Imaging Survey of Embedded Young Stellar Objects in the
  Rho Ophiuchi Cloud Core","Results of a comprehensive, new, ground-based mid-infrared imaging survey of
the young stellar population of the Rho Ophiuchi cloud are presented. Data were
acquired at the Palomar 5-m and at the Keck 10-m telescopes with the MIRLIN and
LWS instruments, at 0.25 arcsec and 0.25 arcsec resolutions, respectively. Of
172 survey objects, 85 were detected. Among the 22 multiple systems observed,
15 were resolved and their individual component fluxes determined. A plot of
the frequency distribution of the detected objects with SED spectral slope
shows that YSOs spend ~400,000 yr in the Flat Spectrum phase, clearing out
their remnant infall envelopes. Mid-infrared variability is found among a
significant fraction of the surveyed objects, and is found to occur for all SED
classes with optically thick disks. Large-amplitude near-infrared variability,
also found for all SED classes with optically thick disks, seems to occur with
somewhat higher frequency at the earlier evolutionary stages. Although a
general trend of mid-infrared excess and NIR veiling exists proceeding through
SED classes, with Class I objects generally exhibiting K-veilings > 1, Flat
Spectrum objects with K-veilings > 0.58, and Class III objects with K-veilings
=0, Class II objects exhibit the widest range of K-band veiling values, 0-4.5.
However, the highly variable value of veiling that a single source can exhibit
in any of the SED classes in which active disk accretion can take place is
striking, and is direct observational evidence for highly time-variable
accretion activity in disks. Finally, by comparing mid-infrared vs.
near-infrared excesses in a subsample with well-determined effective
temperatures and extinction values, disk clearing mechanisms are explored. The
results are consistent with disk clearing proceeding from the inside-out.",2005-04-19T22:04:33Z
"The Stellar Content of Nearby Star-Forming Galaxies. III. Unravelling
  the Nature of the Diffuse Ultraviolet Light","We investigate the nature of the diffuse intra-cluster ultraviolet light seen
in twelve local starburst galaxies, using long-slit ultraviolet spectroscopy
obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) aboard the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST). We take this faint intra-cluster light to be the field
in each galaxy, and compare its spectroscopic signature with STARBURST99
evolutionary synthesis models and with neighboring star clusters. Our main
result is that the diffuse ultraviolet light in eleven of the twelve starbursts
lacks the strong O-star wind features that are clearly visible in spectra of
luminous clusters in the same galaxies. The difference in stellar features
dominating cluster and field spectra indicate that the field light originates
primarily from a different stellar population, and not from scattering of UV
photons leaking out of the massive clusters. We consider several scenarios to
understand the lack of observed O stars in the field, and their implications
for the origin of the field stellar population. If the field stellar
populations formed in situ, the field must either have an IMF which is steeper
than Salpeter (3.0-3.5) or a Salpeter slope with an upper mass cutoff of 30-50
solar masses. If star formation occurs primarily in star clusters, the field
could be composed of older, faded clusters, and/or a population which is coeval
with the luminous clusters but lower in mass. If the field is composed of
older, dissolving clusters, we estimate that star clusters (regardless of mass)
need to dissolve on timescales 7-10 Myr to create the field (abridged).",2005-05-02T14:13:45Z
"Estimating the Porosity of the Interstellar Medium from
  Three-Dimensional Photoionization Modeling of H II Regions","We apply our three dimensional photoionization code to model Wisconsin
H-alpha Mapper observations of the H II region surrounding the O9.5V star Zeta
Oph. Our models investigate the porosity of the interstellar medium around zeta
Oph and the effects of 3D densities on the H-alpha surface brightness and
variation in the [N II]/H-alpha line ratio. The Zeta Oph H II region has a well
characterized ionizing source, so it is an excellent starting point for 3D
models of diffuse ionized gas. We investigate various hierarchically clumped
density structures, varying the overall smoothness within the clumping
algorithm. By simulating the observations, we can estimate the porosity of the
medium in the vicinity of Zeta Oph and find that within the context of our
hierarchically clumped models, around 50% to 80% of the volume is occupied by
clumps surrounded by a low density smooth medium. We also conclude that in
order for O stars to ionize the diffuse Warm Ionized Medium, the O star
environment must be more porous than that surrounding Zeta Oph, with clumps
occupying less than one half of the interstellar volume. Our clumpy models have
irregular boundaries, similar to observed H II regions. However, in observed H
II regions it is difficult to identify the precise location of the boundary
because of the foreground and/or background emission from the widespread Warm
Ionized Medium. This complicates the interpretation of the predicted rapid rise
of some emission line ratios near the edge of uniform density H II regions and
combined with the three dimensional clumpy nature of the interstellar medium
may explain the apparent lack of distinctive emission line ratios near H I -- H
II interfaces.",2005-06-15T12:01:23Z
Slingshot prominences above stellar X-ray coronae,"We present a new model for the coronal structure of rapidly rotating
solar-type stars. The presence of prominences trapped in co-rotation 2 to 5
stellar radii above the stellar surface has been taken as evidence that the
coronae of these stars must be very extended. The observed surface magnetic
fields, however, cannot contain X-ray emitting gas out to these distances. We
present an alternative model: that these prominences are trapped in long thin
loops embedded not in the X-ray corona, but in the wind. Above coronal helmet
streamers, oppositely-directed wind-bearing field lines reconnect to form
closed loops which then fill up with gas that was originally part of the wind.
We demonstrate that static equilibria exist for these loops at a range of
pressures and temperatures. The maximum loop height falls as the rotation rate
increases, but rises as the loop temperature decreases. For a solar-mass star
with rotation period 0.5 days, whose X-ray corona extends 1stellar radius above
the surface, loops at temperatures of 10, 000 K can extend out to 5 stellar
radii.",2005-06-10T11:29:44Z
Runaway collisions in young star clusters. I. Methods and tests,"We present the methods and preparatory work for our study of the collisional
runaway scenario to form a very massive star (VMS, M > 400 Msun) at the centre
of a young, compact stellar cluster. In the first phase of the process, a very
dense central core of massive stars (M =~ 30-120 Msun) forms through mass
segregation and gravothermal collapse. This leads to a collisional stage,
likely to result in the formation of a VMS (itself a possible progenitor for an
intermediate-mass black hole) through a runaway sequence of mergers between the
massive stars. In this paper we present the runaway scenario in a general
astrophysical context. We then explain the numerical method used to investigate
it. Our approach is based on a Monte Carlo code to simulate the stellar
dynamics of spherical star clusters using a very large number of particles (a
few 1e5 to several 1e6). Finally, we report on test computations carried out to
ensure that our implementation of the important physics is sound. In a second
paper, we present results from more than 100 cluster simulations realized to
determine the conditions leading to the collisional formation of a VMS and the
characteristics of the runaway sequences.",2005-03-07T04:35:43Z
Core Overshoot: An Improved Treatment and Constraints from Seismic Data,"We present a comprehensive set of stellar evolution models for Procyon A in
an effort to guide future measurements of both traditional stellar parameters
and seismic frequencies towards constraining the amount of core overshoot in
Procyon A and possibly other stars. Current observational measurements of
Procyon A when combined with traditional stellar modeling only place a large
upper limit on overshoot of alphaOV < 1.1. By carrying out a detailed pulsation
analysis, we further demonstrate, how p- and g-mode averaged spacings can be
used to gain better estimates of the core size. For both p- and g-modes, the
frequency spacings for models without overshoot are clearly separated from the
models with overshoot. In addition, measurements of the l=0 averaged small
p-mode spacings could be used to establish Procyon A's evolutionary stage. For
a fixed implementation of overshoot and under favorable circumstances, the
g-mode spacings can be used to determine the overshoot extent to an accuracy of
+-0.05 Hp. However, we stress that considerable confusion is added due to the
unknown treatment of the overshoot region. This ambiguity might be removed by
analyzing many different stars. A simple non-local convection theory developed
by Kuhfuss is implemented in our stellar evolution code and contrasted with the
traditional approaches. We show that this theory supports a moderate increase
of the amount of convective overshoot with stellar mass of Delta(alphaOV) =
+0.10 between 1.5 Msun and 15 Msun. This theory places an upper limit on
Procyon A's core overshoot extent of ~0.4 Hp which matches the limit imposed by
Roxburgh's integral criterion.",2005-05-01T18:22:47Z
Neptune Trojans as a Testbed for Planet Formation,"The problem of accretion in the Trojan 1:1 resonance is akin to the standard
problem of planet formation, transplanted from a star-centered disk to a disk
centered on the Lagrange point. The newly discovered class of Neptune Trojans
promises to test theories of planet formation by coagulation. Neptune Trojans
resembling the prototype 2001 QR322 (``QR'')--whose radius of ~100 km is
comparable to that of the largest Jupiter Trojan--may outnumber their Jovian
counterparts by a factor of ~10. We discover that seeding the 1:1 resonance
with debris from planetesimal collisions and having the seed particles accrete
in situ naturally reproduces the inferred number of QR-sized Trojans. We
analyze accretion in the Trojan sub-disk by applying the two-groups method,
accounting for kinematics specific to the resonance. We find that a Trojan
sub-disk comprising decimeter-sized seed particles and having a surface density
1e-3 that of the local minimum-mass disk produces ~10 QR-sized objects in ~1
Gyr, in accord with observation. Further growth is halted by collisional
diffusion of seed particles out of resonance. In our picture, the number and
sizes of the largest Neptune Trojans represent the unadulterated outcome of
dispersion-dominated, oligarchic accretion. Large Neptune Trojans, perhaps the
most newly accreted objects in our Solar System, may today have a dispersion in
orbital inclination of less than ~10 degrees, despite the existence of niches
of stability at higher inclinations. Such a vertically thin disk, born of a
dynamically cold environment necessary for accretion, and raised in minimal
contact with external perturbations, contrasts with the thick disks of other
minor body belts.",2005-02-14T21:06:17Z
Photometric and Obscurational Completeness,"We report a method that uses ""completeness"" to estimate the number of
exrasolar planets discovered by an observing program with a direct-imaging
instrument. We develop a completeness function for Earth-like planets on
""habitable"" orbits for an instrument with a central field obscuration, uniform
sensitivity in an annular detection zone, and limiting sensitivity that is
expressed as a ""delta magnitude"" with respect to the star, determined by
systematic effects (given adequate exposure time). We demonstrate our method of
estimation by applying it to our understanding of the coronagraphic version of
the Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF-C) mission as of October 2004. We establish
an initial relationship between the size, quality, and stability of the
instrument's optics and its ability to meet mission science requirements. We
provide options for increasing the fidelity and versatility of the models on
which our method is based, and we discuss how the method could be extended to
model the TPF-C mission as a whole, to verify that its design can meet the
science requirements.",2005-03-03T14:52:36Z
A Dark Hydrogen Cloud in the Virgo Cluster,"VIRGOHI21 is an HI source detected in the Virgo Cluster survey of Davies et
al. (2004) which has a neutral hydrogen mass of 10^8 M_solar and a velocity
width of Delta V_20 = 220 km/s. From the Tully-Fisher relation, a galaxy with
this velocity width would be expected to be 12th magnitude or brighter; however
deep CCD imaging has failed to turn up a counterpart down to a
surface-brightness level of 27.5 B mag/sq. arcsec. The HI observations show
that it is extended over at least 16 kpc which, if the system is bound, gives
it a minimum dynamical mass of ~10^11 M_solar and a mass to light ratio of
M_dyn/L_B > 500 M_solar/L_solar. If it is tidal debris then the putative
parents have vanished; the remaining viable explanation is that VIRGOHI21 is a
dark halo that does not contain the expected bright galaxy. This object was
found because of the low column density limit of our survey, a limit much lower
than that achieved by all-sky surveys such as HIPASS. Further such sensitive
surveys might turn up a significant number of the dark matter halos predicted
by Dark Matter models.",2005-02-16T10:49:03Z
Evolution of the 3.6 micron Cluster Luminosity Function,"We have measured the 3.6 micron cluster luminosity function (LF) using a
sample of 123 galaxy clusters selected from the 4 degree^2 Spitzer First Look
Survey (FLS). The clusters were selected on the basis of their R - 3.6 micron
colors using the cluster red-sequence technique of Gladders & Yee (2000). The
binned LFs are well-fit by a Schechter function at all redshifts. However, we
note two interesting trends. Firstly, the evolution of Mstar with redshift is
consistent with models that form galaxies in a single-burst of star-formation
at z > 2.0, and evolve passively thereafter. Secondly, the faint-end slope of
the LF appears to become shallower at higher redshift. We conclude that the
most massive galaxies were formed in the cluster at high redshift (z > 2),
while lower-mass galaxies have subsequently been accreted from the field at
lower redshift (z ~ 0.5). These results are consistent with the ``downsizing''
picture seen in previous cluster studies using smaller samples.",2005-03-29T23:24:34Z
"Spitzer Detection of PAH and Silicate Dust Features in the Mid-Infrared
  Spectra of z~2 Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies","We report the initial results from a Spitzer GO-1 program to obtain low
resolution, mid-infrared spectra of infrared luminous galaxies at z~1-2. This
paper presents the spectra of eight sources observed with the Spitzer InfraRed
Spectrograph (IRS). Of the eight spectra, six have mid-IR spectral features,
either emission from Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) or silicate
absorption. Based on these mid-IR features, the inferred six redshifts are in
the range of 1.8-2.6. The remaining two spectra detect only strong continua,
thus do not yield redshift information. Strong, multiple PAH emission features
are detected in two sources, and weak PAH emission in another two. These data
provide direct evidence that PAH molecules are present and directly observable
in ULIRGs at z~2.
  The six sources with measured redshifts are dusty, infrared luminous galaxies
at z~2 with estimated $L_{bol} \sim 10^{13}L_\odot$. Of the eight sources, two
appear starburst dominated; two with only power law continua are probably type
I QSOs; and the remaining four are likely composite systems containing a buried
AGN and a starburst component. Since half of our sample are optically faint
sources with R>25.5mag (Vega), our results demonstrate the potential of using
mid-infrared spectroscopy, especially the Aromatic and silicate features
produced by dust grains to directly probe optically faint and infrared luminous
populations at high redshift.",2005-04-14T23:20:31Z
Non-gaussianity from the second-order cosmological perturbation,"Several conserved and/or gauge invariant quantities described as the
second-order curvature perturbation have been given in the literature. We
revisit various scenarios for the generation of second-order non-gaussianity in
the primordial curvature perturbation \zeta, employing for the first time a
unified notation and focusing on the normalisation f_{NL} of the bispectrum.
When the classical curvature perturbation first appears a few Hubble times
after horizon exit, |f_{NL}| is much less than 1 and is, therefore, negligible.
Thereafter \zeta (and hence f_{NL}) is conserved as long as the pressure is a
unique function of energy density (adiabatic pressure). Non-adiabatic pressure
comes presumably only from the effect of fields, other than the one pointing
along the inflationary trajectory, which are light during inflation (`light
non-inflaton fields'). During single-component inflation f_{NL} is constant,
but multi-component inflation might generate |f_{NL}| \sim 1 or bigger.
Preheating can affect f_{NL} only in atypical scenarios where it involves light
non-inflaton fields. The curvaton scenario typically gives f_{NL} \ll -1 or
f_{NL} = +5/4. The inhomogeneous reheating scenario can give a wide range of
values for f_{NL}. Unless there is a detection, observation can eventually
provide a limit |f_{NL}| \lsim 1, at which level it will be crucial to
calculate the precise observational limit using second order theory.",2005-02-28T16:40:56Z
Dark Matter and Dark Energy from a single scalar field and CMB data,"Axions are likely to be the Dark Matter (DM) that cosmological data require.
They arise in the Peccei Quinn solution of the strong CP problem. In a previous
work we showed that their model has a simple and natural generalization which
yields also Dark Energy (DE), in fair proportions, without tuning any
parameter: DM and DE arise from a single scalar field and are weakly coupled in
the present era. In this paper we extend the analysis of this dual-axion
cosmology and fit it to WMAP data, by using a Markov chain technique. We find
that LCDM, dynamical DE with a SUGRA potential, DE with a SUGRA potential and a
constant DE-DM coupling, as well as the dual-axion model with a SUGRA
potential, fit data with a similar accuracy. The best-fit parameters are
however fairly different, although consistency is mostly recovered at the
2-sigma level. A peculiarity of the dual-axion model with SUGRA potential is to
cause more stringent constraints on most parameters and to favor high values of
the Hubble parameter.",2005-03-02T10:27:46Z
High-resolution observations of SN 2001gd in NGC 5033,"We report on 8.4 GHz VLBI observations of SN2001gd in the spiral galaxy
NGC5033 made on 26 June 2002 and 8 April 2003. Our data nominally suggests a
relatively strong deceleration for the expansion of SN2001gd, but we cannot
dismiss the possibility of a free supernova expansion. From our VLBI
observations on 8 April 2003, we inferred a minimum total energy in
relativistic particles and magnetic fields in the supernova shell of E_min
=(0.3-14) 10^{47} ergs, and a corresponding equipartition average magnetic
field of B_min = (50--350) mG. We also present multiwavelength VLA measurements
of SN2001gd, which are well fit by an optically thin, synchrotron spectrum,
partially absorbed by thermal plasma. We obtain a supernova flux density of
(1.02 +/- 0.05) mJy at the observing frequency of 8.4 GHz for the second epoch,
which results in an isotropic radio luminosity of (6.0 +/- 0.3) * 10^{36} ergs
between 1.4 and 43.3 GHz, at an adopted distance of 13.1 Mpc. Finally, we
report on an XMM-Newton X-ray detection of SN2001gd on 18 December 2002. The
supernova X-ray spectrum is consistent with optically thin emission from a soft
component (associated with emission from the reverse shock) at a temperature
around 1 keV. The observed flux corresponds to an isotropic X-ray luminosity of
L_X = 1.4 +/- 0.4 * 10^{39} ergs/s in the (0.3-5) keV band. We suggest that
both radio and X-ray observations of SN2001gd indicate that a circumstellar
interaction similar to that displayed by SN1993J in M81 is taking place.",2005-04-28T20:02:50Z
The Anisotropic Distribution of Galactic Satellites,"We present a study of the spatial distribution of subhalos in galactic dark
matter halos using dissipationless cosmological simulations of the concordance
LCDM model. We find that subhalos are distributed anisotropically and are
preferentially located along the major axes of the triaxial mass distributions
of their hosts. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov probability for drawing our simulated
subhalo sample from an isotropic distribution is P_KS \simeq 1.5 \times
10^{-4}. An isotropic distribution of subhalos is thus not the correct null
hypothesis for testing the CDM paradigm. The nearly planar distribution of
observed Milky Way (MW) satellites is marginally consistent (probability \simeq
0.02) with being drawn randomly from the subhalo distribution in our
simulations. Furthermore, if we select the subhalos likely to be luminous, we
find a distribution that is consistent with the observed MW satellites. In
fact, we show that subsamples of the subhalo population with a
centrally-concentrated radial distribution, similar to that of the MW dwarfs,
typically exhibit a comparable degree of planarity. We explore the origin of
the observed subhalo anisotropy and conclude that it is likely due to (1)
preferential accretion of subhalos along filaments, often closely aligned with
the major axis of the host halo, and (2) evolution of satellite orbits within
the prolate, triaxial potentials typical of CDM halos. Agreement between
predictions and observations requires the major axis of the outer dark matter
halo of the Milky Way to be nearly perpendicular to the disk. We discuss
possible observational tests of such disk-halo alignment with current large
galaxy surveys.",2005-02-24T14:53:06Z
"Far-Infrared and Millimeter Continuum Studies of K Giants: Alpha Boo and
  Alpha Tau","We have imaged two normal, non-coronal, infrared-bright K giants, Alpha Tau
and Alpha Boo, in the 1.4-mm and 2.8-mm continuum using the Berkeley Illinois
Maryland Association millimeter array. These stars have been used as important
absolute calibrators for several infrared infrared satellites. Our goals are:
(1) to establish whether these stars radiate as simple photospheres or possess
long-wavelength chromospheres; and (2) to make a connection between millimeter
wave and far-infrared absolute flux calibrations. To accomplish these goals we
also present Infrared Space Observatory Long Wavelength Spectrometer
measurements of both these K giants. The far-infrared and millimeter continuum
radiation is produced in the vicinity of the temperature minimum in Alpha Tau
and Alpha Boo. We find that current photospheric models predict fluxes in
reasonable agreement with those observed for wavelengths which sample the upper
photosphere, namely <=125 microns in Alpha Tau and Alpha Boo. We clearly detect
chromospheric radiation from both stars by 2.8mm (by 1.4mm in the case of Alpha
Boo). Only additional observations can determine precisely where beyond 125
microns the purely radiative models fail. Until then, purely radiative models
for these stars can only be used with confidence for calibration purposes below
125 microns.",2005-02-24T18:43:17Z
The origin of intergalactic metals around Lyman-break galaxies,"Theoretical and observational arguments suggest that the intergalactic medium
(IGM) might have been polluted with metals produced by early star formation. In
this scenario, Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at redshift z=3 are likely to be
surrounded by old metal bubbles, relics of an era when the characteristic mass
of galaxies was small and gas retainment more difficult. We find that
pregalactic enrichment of the IGM from 10^8-10^{10} M_sun dwarf galaxies at
6<z<12 can quantitatively explain the high cross-correlation between CIV
systems and LBGs observed at z=3. The reason is twofold. First, both LBGs and
high-z dwarfs are biased tracer of the mass distribution and form from
exceptionally high density fluctuations which are strongly clustered. Second,
the action of gravity tends to increase the spatial association between metal
bubbles and LBGs. Our analysis shows that, in order to match the abundance of
CIV systems observed at z=3, the metal bubbles generated by high-z dwarfs must
have comoving sizes of ~100 kpc. We conclude that the observed galaxy-CIV
spatial association needs not to be generated by late ``superwinds'' from LBGs.",2005-04-06T20:00:06Z
Discovery of an extended ultraviolet disk in the nearby galaxy NGC4625,"Recent far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) observations of the nearby galaxy
NGC4625 made by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) show the presence of an
extended UV disk reaching 4 times the optical radius of the galaxy. The
UV-to-optical colors suggest that the bulk of the stars in the disk of NGC4625
are currently being formed, providing a unique opportunity to study today the
physics of star formation under conditions similar to those when the normal
disks of spiral galaxies like the Milky Way first formed. In the case of
NGC4625, the star formation in the extended disk is likely to be triggered by
interaction with NGC4618 and possibly also with the newly discovered galaxy
NGC4625A. The positions of the FUV complexes in the extended disk coincide with
peaks in the H I distribution. The masses of these complexes are in the range
10^3-10^4 Msun with their Halpha emission (when present) being dominated by
ionization from single stars.",2005-06-15T22:20:06Z
"Extragalactic Globular Clusters in the Near-Infrared: V. IC 4051 and NGC
  3311","We present the results of combined optical and near-infrared photometry for
the globular cluster systems of the giant ellipticals IC 4051 and NGC 3311. We
use the reduced age-metallicity degeneracy in (V-I) vs.(V-H) color-color
diagrams to derive the cumulative age distribution within the red
sub-population of globular clusters and to search for age sub-populations. The
age distribution is then compared to the one determined for simulated globular
cluster systems in order to set constraints on the relative age and size of
these globular cluster sub-populations. In both galaxies we find a significant
fraction of globular clusters with ages between 2- 5 Gyr. We also investigate
the metallicity distribution in both systems. Small number statistics prevent
us from making any definite statements concerning NGC 3311, but we find that
the derived metallicity distribution of the IC 4051 clusters strongly depends
on the assumed age distribution. Based on our most likely result that finds a
large number of young/intermediate age clusters (~2 Gyr) within the selected
globular cluster sample, we find metallicity peaks at $\sim$ -0.2 for the old
clusters and +0.8 for the young clusters. Only few very metal poor clusters are
found. However, the metallicity distribution within the young/intermediate
globular cluster population is significantly affected by our choice of the
applied Single Stellar Population model. The mean metallicity of the second
generation of globular clusters changes from the above mentioned and extremely
high +0.8 dex to +0.2 dex. Note that the model dependency becomes less severe
with an increasing age of the cluster population.",2005-05-05T18:12:54Z
"Rotochemical Heating in Millisecond Pulsars. Formalism and
  Non-superfluid case","Rotochemical heating originates in a departure from beta equilibrium due to
spin-down compression in a rotating neutron star. The main consequence is that
the star eventually arrives at a quasi-equilibrium state, in which the thermal
photon luminosity depends only on the current value of the spin-down power,
which is directly measurable. Only in millisecond pulsars the spin-down power
remains high long enough for this state to be reached with a substantial
luminosity. We report an extensive study of the effect of this heating
mechanism on the thermal evolution of millisecond pulsars, developing a general
formalism in the slow-rotation approximation of general relativity that takes
the spatial structure of the star fully into account, and using a sample of
realistic equations of state to solve the non-superfluid case numerically. We
show that nearly all observed millisecond pulsars are very likely to be in the
quasi-equilibrium state. Our predicted quasi-equilibrium temperatures for PSR
J0437-4715 are only 20% lower than inferred from observations. Accounting for
superfluidity should increase the predicted value.",2005-02-05T01:00:19Z
SPI energy calibration,"The status of the SPI energy calibration after the first year of INTEGRAL
operations is reported. We have studied the gain variations and we have
demonstrated that the most important parameter is the germanium detector
temperature. This study permits us to determine the limits of our calibration
method and the frequency of calibrations needed.",2005-04-14T16:38:53Z
Polarization microvariability of BL Lac objects,"We present the results of a systematic observational campaign designed to
search for microvariability in the optical polarization of BL Lac objects. We
have observed a sample formed by 8 X-ray-selected and 10 radio-selected
sources, looking for rapid changes in both the degree of linear polarization
and the corresponding polarization angle. The whole campaign was carried out
along the last three years, and most of the objects were observed at least on
two consecutive nights. The statistical properties of both classes of BL Lac
objects are compared, and some general conclusions on the nature of the
phenomenon are drawn. In general, radio selected sources seem to display higher
duty cycles for polarimetric microvariability and, on average, they have a
stronger polarization.",2005-06-16T13:19:02Z
The Warped Circumstellar Disk of HD100546,"We propose that the two armed spiral features seen in visible Hubble Space
Telescope images of scattered light in HD100546's circumstellar disk are caused
by the illumination of a warped outer disk. A tilt of 6-15 degrees from the
symmetry plane can cause the observed surface brightness variations providing
the disk is very twisted (highly warped) at radii greater than 200 AU where the
spiral features are seen. Dust lanes are due in part to shadowing in the
equatorial plane from the inner disk within a radius of 100 AU. HD100546's
outer disk, if viewed edge-on, would appear similar to that of Beta Pictorus. A
disk initially misaligned with a planetary system, becomes warped due to
precession induced by planetesimal bodies and planets. However, the twistedness
of HD100546's disk cannot be explained by precession during the lifetime of the
system induced by a single Jovian mass planet within the clearing at ~13 AU.
One possible explanation for the corrugated disk is that precession was induced
by massive of bodies embedded in the disk at larger radius. This would require
approximately a Jupiter mass of bodies well outside the central clearing at 13
AU and within the location of the spiral features or at radii approximately
between 50-200 AU.",2005-05-05T05:10:13Z
Neutrino Mass Limit from Galaxy Cluster Number Density Evolution,"Measurements of the evolution with redshift of the number density of massive
galaxy clusters are used to constrain the energy density of massive neutrinos
and so the sum of neutrino masses $\sum m_\nu$. We consider a spatially-flat
cosmological model with cosmological constant, cold dark matter, baryonic
matter, and massive neutrinos. Accounting for the uncertainties in the
measurements of the relevant cosmological parameters we obtain a limit of $\sum
m_\nu$ $<$ 2.4 eV (95 % C.L.).",2005-03-15T22:48:13Z
Fractal dimensions of the galaxy distribution varying by steps?,"The structure of the large scale distribution of the galaxies have been
widely studied since the publication of the first catalogs. Since large
redshift samples are available, their analyses seem to show fractal
correlations up to the observational limits. The value of the fractal
dimension(s) calculated by different authors have become the object of a large
debate, as have been the value of the expected transition from fractality to a
possible large scale homogeneity. Moreover, some authors have proposed that
different scaling regimes might be discerned at different lenght scales. To go
further on into this issue, we have applied the correlation integral method to
the wider sample currently available. We therefore obtain a fractal dimension
of the galaxy distribution which seems to vary by steps whose width might be
related to the organization hierarchy observed for the galaxies. This result
could explain some of the previous results obtained by other authors from the
analyses of less complete catalogs and maybe reconcile their apparent
discrepancy. However, the method applied here needs to be further checked,
since it produces odd fluctuations at each transition scale, which need to be
thoroughly explained.",2005-04-20T14:59:47Z
Spitzer view on the evolution of star-forming galaxies from z=0 to z~3,"We use a 24 micron selected sample containing more than 8,000 sources to
study the evolution of star-forming galaxies in the redshift range from z=0 to
z~3. We obtain photometric redshifts for most of the sources in our survey
using a method based on empirically-built templates spanning from ultraviolet
to mid-infrared wavelengths. The accuracy of these redshifts is better than 10%
for 80% of the sample. The derived redshift distribution of the sources
detected by our survey peaks at around z=0.6-1.0 (the location of the peak
being affected by cosmic variance), and decays monotonically from z~1 to z~3.
We have fitted infrared luminosity functions in several redshift bins in the
range 0<z<~3. Our results constrain the density and/or luminosity evolution of
infrared-bright star-forming galaxies. The typical infrared luminosity (L*)
decreases by an order of magnitude from z~2 to the present. The cosmic star
formation rate (SFR) density goes as (1+z)^{4.0\pm0.2} from z=0 to z=0.8. From
z=0.8 to z~1.2, the SFR density continues rising with a smaller slope. At
1.2<z<3, the cosmic SFR density remains roughly constant. The SFR density is
dominated at low redshift (z<0.5) by galaxies which are not very luminous in
the infrared (L_TIR<1.e11 L_sun, where L_TIR is the total infrared luminosity,
integrated from 8 to 1000 micron). The contribution from luminous and
ultraluminous infrared galaxies (L_TIR>1.e11 L_sun) to the total SFR density
increases steadily from z~0 up to z~2.5, forming at least half of the
newly-born stars by z~1.5. Ultraluminous infrared galaxies (L_TIR>1.e12 L_sun)
play a rapidly increasing role for z>~1.3.",2005-05-05T15:20:03Z
Evolution of the ISM and Galactic Activity,"We study the effects of time-dependent mass injection and heating on the
evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM) in elliptical galaxies. As the large
and luminous ellipticals have supermassive black holes at their cores, which
were probably much less massive in the young universe, feeding these black
holes is essential. We examine steady state solutions and describe the impact
of the initial starburst on the evolution of the ISM and consequences for
galactic activity, based on results from Starburst99.",2005-02-21T10:23:46Z
Time variability of AGN and heating of cooling flows,"There is increasing evidence that AGN mechanical feedback is important in the
energetics of cooling flows in galaxies and galaxy clusters. We investigate the
implications of the variability of AGN mechanical luminosity L_m on
observations of cooling flows and radio galaxies in general. It is natural to
assume that l=ln(L_m/L_x) is a Gaussian process. Then L_m will be log-normally
distributed at fixed cooling luminosity L_x, and the variance in a measure of
L_m will increase with the time-resolution of the measure. We test the
consistency of these predictions with existing data. These tests hinge on the
power spectrum of l(t). Monitoring of Seyfert galaxies combined with estimates
of the duty cycle of quasars imply flicker noise spectra, similar to those of
microquasars. We combine a sample of sources in cooling flows that have
cavities with the assumption that the average mechanical luminosity of the AGN
equals L_x. Given that the mechanical luminosities are characterized by flicker
noise, we find that their spectral amplitudes lie between the estimated
amplitudes of quasars and the measured values for the radio luminosities of
microquasars. The model together with the observation that powerful radio
galaxies lie within a narrow range in optical luminosity, predicts the
luminosity function of radio galaxies, in agreement with observations.
Forthcoming radio surveys will test the prediction that the luminosity function
turns over at about the smallest luminosities so far probed. [Abridged]",2005-05-03T18:29:11Z
Convective magneto-rotational instabilities in accretion disks,"We present a study of instabilities occuring in thick magnetized accretion
disks. We calculate the growth rates of these instabilities and characterise
precisely the contribution of the magneto-rotational and the convective
mechanism. All our calculations are performed in radially stratified disks in
the cylindrical limit. The numerical calculations are performed using the
appropriate local dispersion equation solver discussed in Blokland et al.
(2005). A comparison with recent results by Narayan et al. (2002) shows
excellent agreement with their approximate growth rates only if the disks are
weakly magnetized. However, for disks close to equipartition, the dispersion
equation from Narayan et al. (2002) loses its validity. Our calculations allow
for a quantitative determination of the increase of the growth rate due to the
magneto-rotational mechanism. We find that the increase of the growth rate for
long wavelength convective modes caused by this mechanism is almost neglible.
On the other hand, the growth rate of short wavelength instabilities can be
significantly increased by this mechanism, reaching values up to 60%.",2005-04-18T13:19:47Z
"Supernova Explosions in the Early Universe: Evolution of Radiative
  Remnants and the Halo Destruction Efficiency","We study the evolution of supernova (SN) remnants of the first stars, taking
proper account of the radiative feedback of the progenitor stars on the
surroundings. We carry out a series of one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations
with radiative cooling, starting from initial configurations that are drawn
from the results of our earlier radiation hydrodynamic simulations of the first
HII regions. In low-mass (< 10^6 M_sun) halos, the stellar radiation
significantly reduces the ambient gas density prior to the SN explosion. The
blastwave quickly propagates over the halo's virial radius, leading to complete
evacuation of the gas even with the input energy of 10^50 erg. We find that a
large fraction of the remnant's thermal energy is lost in 0.1-10 Myr by line
cooling, whereas, for larger explosion energies, the remnant expands even more
rapidly with decreasing interior density, and cools predominantly via inverse
Compton process. In higher mass halos, the gas density near the explosion site
remains high and the SN shock is heavily confined; the thermal energy of the
remnant is quickly radiated away by free-free emission, even if the total input
energy exceeds the binding energy of halos by two orders of magnitude. We show
that the efficiency of halo destruction is determined not only by the explosion
energy but also by the gas density profile, and thus controlled by radiative
feedback prior to the explosion. Several implications of our results for the
formation of first quasars and second-generation stars in the universe are also
discussed.",2005-05-18T11:23:49Z
"Energy Extraction from a Kerr Black Hole - An Ultimate Power Source in
  the Universe?","It is widely believed that some classes of high-energy transients may be
powered by the rotational energy of a rapidly spinning black hole. The energy
extraction mechanism commonly discussed involves macroscopic magnetic fields
that are produced by currents flowing in a disk or torus surrounding the black
hole. In spite of large efforts that have led to impressive progress in our
understanding of the physics of magnetized flows in Kerr geometry, several
important issues remain unresolved: the nature of the load in the
Blandford-Znajeck model, the causality and stability of a force-free
magnetosphere, global current closure, and the role of boundary conditions on
the channels through which the extracted energy is released. This chapter
provides an account of recent work that addresses some of those open questions.",2005-02-17T11:45:20Z
What Is The Neon Abundance Of The Sun?,"We have evolved a series of thirteen complete solar models that utilize
different assumed heavy element compositions. Models that are based upon the
heavy element abundances recently determined by Asplund, Grevesse, and Sauval
(2005) are inconsistent with helioseismological measurements. However, models
in which the neon abundance is increased by 0.4-0.5 dex to log N(Ne) = 8.29 +-
0.05 (on the scale in which log N(H) = 12) are consistent with the
helioseismological measurements even though the other heavy element abundances
are in agreement with the determinations of Asplund et al. (2005). These
results sharpen and strengthen an earlier study by Antia and Basu (2005). The
predicted solar neutrino fluxes are affected by the uncertainties in the
composition by less than their 1sigma theoretical uncertainties.",2005-02-28T17:23:32Z
From Neutron Star Binaries to Gamma-ray bursts,"I summarize recent results about how a neutron star binary coalescence can
produce short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Two possibilities are discussed: the
annihilation of neutrino anti-neutrino pairs above the merged remnant and the
exponential amplification of magnetic fields in the central object up to values
close to equipartition. We find that the neutrino annihilation drives bipolar,
relativistic outflows with Lorentz-factors large enough to circumvent the GRB
'compactness problem'. The total energy within these outflows is moderate by
GRB-standards ($\sim 10^{48}-10^{49}$ ergs), but the interaction with the
baryonic material blown-off by the neutrinos collimates the outflows into
opening angles of typically 0.1 sterad, yielding isotropic energies close to
$10^{51}$ ergs. We further want to stress the plausibility of the central
object resisting the immediate collapse to a black hole. In this case the
central object will --similar to a proto-neutron star-- be subject to neutrino
driven convection that --together with the rapid, differential rotation-- will
lead to a drastic amplification of pre-existing magnetic fields. Within
fractions of a second, field strengths comparable to equipartition field
strength ($> 10^{17}$ G) will be reached. These will produce large torques that
will spin-down the object within about 0.2 s, and would thus naturally explain
the duration of short GRBs.",2005-04-17T17:16:07Z
"Comment on ""Gamma-ray burst early afterglows: reverse shock emission
  from an arbitrarily magnetized ejecta"" by Zhang and Kobayashi (2004)","Zhang and Kobayashi (2004) attempted to calculate early afterglow emission
from a system of forward and reverse shocks in GRB outflows for the case of
magnetized ejecta. We point out a fundamental error in the underlying dynamical
model. According to the authors, energy and momentum carried by the magnetic
field of the ejecta are not transfered to the forward shock. This is an
incorrect assumption that invalidates the results.",2005-03-23T18:49:18Z
High-redshift quasar host galaxies with adaptive optics,"We present K band adaptive optics observations of three high-redshift (z ~
2.2) high-luminosity quasars, all of which were studied for the first time. We
also bserved several point spread function (PSF) calibrators,
non-simultaneously because of the small field of view. The significant temporal
PSF variations on timescales of minutes inhibited a straightforward scaled PSF
removal from the quasar images. Characterising the degree of PSF concentration
by the radii encircling 20% and 80% of the total flux, respectively, we found
that even under very different observing conditions the r_20 vs. r_80 relation
varied coherently between individual short exposure images, delineating a
well-defined relation for point sources. Placing the quasar images on this
relation, we see indications that all three objects were resolved. We designed
a procedure to estimate the significance of this result, and to estimate host
galaxy parameters, by reproducing the statistical distribution of the
individual short exposure images. We find in all three cases evidence for a
luminous host galaxy, with a mean absolute magnitude of M_R = -27.0 and scale
lengths around ~ 4-12 kpc. Together with a rough estimate of the central black
hole masses obtained from C_iv line widths, the location of the objects on the
bulge luminosity vs. black hole mass relation is not significantly dfferent
from the low-redshift regime, assuming only passive evolution of the host
galaxy. Corresponding Eddington luminosities are L_nuc/L_Edd ~ 0.1-0.6.",2005-03-13T16:12:54Z
The Stellar Mass Evolution of Galaxies in the NICMOS Ultra Deep Field,"We measure the build-up of the stellar mass of galaxies from z=6 to z=1.
Using 15 band multicolor imaging data in the NICMOS Ultra Deep Field we derive
photometric redshifts and masses for 796 galaxies down to H(AB)=26.5. The
derived evolution of the global stellar mass density of galaxies is consistent
with previous star formation rate density measurements over the observed range
of redshifts. Beyond the observed range, maintaining consistency between the
global stellar mass and the observed star formation rate suggests the epoch of
galaxy formation was z=16.",2005-03-11T21:00:09Z
Gravitational waves from remnants of ultraluminous X-ray sources,"Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) with X-ray luminosities larger than the
Eddington luminosity of stellar mass objects may be powered by intermediate
mass black holes (IBHs) of masses Mbh~10^3Msun. If IBHs form in young dense
stellar clusters, they can be fed by Roche lobe overflow from a tidally
captured massive (Ms>10Msun) stellar companion. After the donor leaves the main
sequence it forms a compact remnant, which spirals in due to gravitational wave
(GW) emission. We show that space based detectors such as the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna are likely to detect several of these sources. GW
sources stemming from this scenario have small eccentricities which give
distinct GW signals. Detection of such a GW signal will unambiguously prove the
existence of IBHs, and support the hypothesis that some ULXs are powered by
IBHs with captured companions.",2005-06-08T20:03:02Z
The near-IR luminosity-metallicity relation of dwarf irregular galaxies,"We report on the recent developments of our long-term investigation of the
near-IR luminosity-metallicity relation for dwarf irregular galaxies in nearby
groups. A very well-defined relation is emerging from our observational
database, and a preliminary discussion of its implications is given.",2005-05-17T17:32:34Z
X-ray properties of active M dwarfs as observed by XMM-Newton,"We present a comparative study of X-ray emission from a sample of active M
dwarfs with spectral types \hbox{M3.5 - M4.5} using XMM-Newton observations of
two single stars, AD Leonis and EV Lacertae, and two unresolved binary systems,
AT Microscopii and EQ Pegasi. The light curves reveal frequent flaring during
all four observations. We perform a uniform spectral analysis and determine
plasma temperatures, abundances and emission measures in different states of
activity. Applying multi-temperature models with variable abundances separately
to data obtained with the EPIC and RGS detectors we are able to investigate the
consistency of the results obtained by the different instruments onboard
XMM-Newton. We find that the X-ray properties of the sample M dwarfs are very
similar, with the coronal abundances of all sample stars following a trend of
increasing abundance with increasing first ionization potential, the inverse
FIP effect. The overall metallicities are below solar photospheric ones but
appear consistent with the measured photospheric abundances of M dwarfs like
these. A significant increase in the prominence of the hotter plasma components
is observed during flares while the cool plasma component is only marginally
affected by flaring, pointing to different coronal structures. AT Mic, probably
a young pre-main-sequence system, has the highest X-ray luminosity and exhibits
also the hottest corona. While results of EQ Peg and EV Lac are presented here
for the first time, AT Mic and AD Leo have been investigated before with
different analysis approaches, allowing a comparison of the results.",2005-04-06T12:01:56Z
"Discovery of the Binary Pulsar PSR B1259-63 in Very-High-Energy Gamma
  Rays around Periastron with H.E.S.S","We report the discovery of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission of the
binary system PSR B1259-63/SS 2883 of a radio pulsar orbiting a massive,
luminous Be star in a highly eccentric orbit. The observations around the 2004
periastron passage of the pulsar were performed with the four 13 m Cherenkov
telescopes of the H.E.S.S. experiment, recently installed in Namibia and in
full operation since December 2003. Between February and June 2004, a gamma-ray
signal from the binary system was detected with a total significance above 13
sigma. The flux was found to vary significantly on timescales of days which
makes PSR B1259-63 the first variable galactic source of VHE gamma-rays
observed so far. Strong emission signals were observed in pre- and
post-periastron phases with a flux minimum around periastron, followed by a
gradual flux decrease in the months after. The measured time-averaged energy
spectrum above a mean threshold energy of 380 GeV can be fitted by a simple
power law F_0(E/1 TeV)^-Gamma with a photon index Gamma =
2.7+-0.2_stat+-0.2_sys and flux normalisation F_0 = (1.3+-0.1_stat+-0.3_sys)
10^-12 TeV^-1 cm^-2 s^-1. This detection of VHE gamma-rays provides unambiguous
evidence for particle acceleration to multi-TeV energies in the binary system.
In combination with coeval observations of the X-ray synchrotron emission by
the RXTE and INTEGRAL instruments, and assuming the VHE gamma-ray emission to
be produced by the inverse Compton mechanism, the magnetic field strength can
be directly estimated to be of the order of 1 G.",2005-06-13T19:04:00Z
"Dark energy transition between quintessence and phantom regimes - an
  equation of state analysis","The dark energy transition between quintessence ($w>-1$) and phantom ($w<-1$)
regimes (the crossing of the cosmological constant boundary) is studied using
the dark energy equation of state. Models characterized by this type of
transition are explicitly constructed and their equation of state is found to
be {\em implicitly} defined. The behavior of the more general models with the
implicitly defined equation of state, obtained by the generalization of the
explicitly constructed models, is studied to gain insight into the necessary
conditions for the occurrence of the transition, as well as to investigate the
mechanism behind the transition. It is found that the parameters of the
generalized models need to satisfy special conditions for the transition to
happen and that the mechanism behind the transition is the cancellation of the
contribution of the cosmological constant boundary. The aspects of the behavior
of the generalized models which are not related to the transition are briefly
discussed and the role of the implicitly defined dark energy equation of state
in the description of the dark energy evolution is emphasized.",2005-04-23T12:30:39Z
Damped Lyman Alpha Surveys and Statistics - A Review,"The history and progress of DLA research over the past several decades is
reviewed here. Larger datasets and deeper surveys, particularly over the last
couple of years, have improved our knowledge of the neutral gas content and
distribution in the universe at all observable redshifts, including the present
epoch. New results on the statistics of DLAs at z<1.65 from our HST-UV surveys
are presented and discussed in the context of recent results at z=0 and at high
redshift. We find that Omega_{DLA}(z>0) remains roughly constant to within the
uncertainties; the z=0 value of the neutral gas mass density, Omega_{g}, is a
factor of ~2 less than Omega_{DLA}. The DLA incidence, n(z), undergoes rapid
evolution between redshifts 5 and 2, but is consistent with the no-evolution
curve in the current concordance cosmology for z ~< 2. We also show that if the
local Schmidt law relating surface density of gas and star formation rate (SFR)
is valid at the DLA redshifts, then the DLA SFR density is too low for them to
provide a significant contribution to the cosmic star formation history (SFH)
at z >~ 1. This implies that the DLAs are unlikely to be the same population as
the star forming galaxies (i.e., the Lyman break and sub-millimeter galaxies)
that dominate the SFH of the high redshift universe. We suggest that this
discrepancy and the DLA ``missing metals'' problem could be the result of
missing very high column density gas due to its very small absorption cross
section. (abridged)",2005-05-23T18:57:21Z
"M74 X-1 (CXOU J013651.1+154547): An Extremely Variable Ultraluminous
  X-Ray Source","Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) have been described variously as the most
luminous normal X-ray binaries, as hypernovae, and as ""intermediate-mass"" black
holes with masses of hundreds to thousands of solar masses. We present results
on M74 X-1 (CXOU J013651.1+154547), a ULX in the nearby spiral galaxy M74 (NGC
628), from observations by Chandra and XMM-Newton. M74 X-1is a persistent
source which exhibits extreme variability and changes in spectral state on
timescales of several thousand seconds. Its variability timescales and behavior
resemble some Galactic microquasars. This suggests that the emission mechanism
may be related to relativistically beamed jets, and that M74 X-1 could be an
extragalactic ""microblazar"" -- a microquasar whose jet axis is aligned with our
line of sight. We also note that its spectrum is consistent with the presence
of a low-temperature disk blackbody component, which, assuming it is due to
radiation from an accretion disk, could indicate that M74 X-1 contains an
intermediate-mass black hole.",2005-05-12T15:47:50Z
Dark matter in the inner parts of barred galaxies: The data,"This paper presents surface photometry (B,V, I, J, H, K) and H_alpha rotation
curves of 27 isolated spiral galaxies. The final goal is to obtain the mass
distribution of a sample of isolated spiral galaxies in order to model their
gas kinematics. This is then compared to the observed rotation curve, to
determine the necessity of a dark halo in the inner parts (Perez et al. 2004).
The azimuthally averaged radial surface brightness profiles and the integrated
magnitudes obtained from ellipse fitting are given for each of the sample
galaxies. The ellipse fitting technique applied to the light distribution also
allowed us to obtain the size of the bar, and the inclination and position
angle of the outer isophotes that allow the galaxy deprojection. Using these
profiles, 1-D disk-bulge decomposition was performed to obtain the disk
scale-length and the bulge effective radius for the different bands. Through
the fitting of a parametric function to the observed rotation curve, the
maximum rotational velocity and the corresponding radius was obtained. The
correlation between the bulge and disk parameters is in agreement with previous
studies (de Jong 1996a; Marquez & Moles 1999; Baggett et al. 1998). Regarding
the Kormendy relation (Kormendy 1977), in agreement with de Jong, no
correlation between the bulge effective radius and its surface brightness is
found, possibly due to the small range of bulge magnitudes covered. We find a
smaller scatter in the structural relations when compared to non-isolated
samples in agreement with Marquez & Moles (1999). Finally, a correlation
between the disk scale-length and the bar size is observed, possibly reflecting
the rapid growth of a bar.",2005-05-31T17:04:22Z
"Proper Motion of H2O Masers in IRAS 20050+2720 MMS1: An AU Scale Jet
  Associated with An Intermediate-Mass Class 0 Source","We conducted a 4 epoch 3 month VLBA proper motion study of H$_2$O masers
toward an intermediate-mass class 0 source IRAS 20050+2720 MMS1 (d=700 pc).
  From milli-arcsecond (mas) resolution VLBA images, we found two groups of H2O
maser spots at the center of the submillimeter core of MMS1. One group consists
of more than $\sim 50$ intense maser spots; the other group consisting of
several weaker maser spots is located at 18 AU south-west of the intense group.
Distribution of the maser spots in the intense group shows an arc-shaped
structure which includes the maser spots that showed a clear velocity gradient.
The spatial and velocity structures of the maser spots in the arc-shape did not
significantly change through the 4 epochs. Furthermore, we found a relative
proper motion between the two groups. Their projected separation increased by
1.13+/-0.11 mas over the 4 epochs along a line connecting them. The spatial and
velocity structures of the intense group and the relative proper motions
strongly suggest that the maser emission is associated with a protostellar jet.
Comparing the observed LSR velocities with calculated radial velocities from a
simple biconical jet model, we conclude that the most of the maser emission are
likely to be associated with an accelerating biconical jet which has large
opening angle. The large opening angle of the jet traced by the masers would
support the hypothesis that poor jet collimation is an inherent property of
luminous (proto)stars.",2005-04-01T23:32:42Z
Echo Tomography of Sco X-1 using Bowen Fluorescence Lines,"We present preliminary results of a simultaneous X-ray/optical campaign of
the prototypical LMXB Sco X-1 at 1-10 Hz time resolution. Lightcurves of the
high excitation Bowen/HeII emission lines were obtained through narrow
interference filters with ULTRACAM, and these were cross-correlated with X-ray
lightcurves. We find evidence for correlated variability, in particular when
Sco X-1 enters the Flaring Branch. The Bowen/HeII lightcurves lag the X-ray
lightcurves with a light travel time which is consistent with reprocessing in
the companion star.",2005-03-03T14:05:57Z
Abundance trends in kinematical groups of the Milky Way's disk,"We have compiled a large catalogue of metallicities and abundance ratios from
the literature in order to investigate abundance trends of several alpha and
iron peak elements in the thin disk and the thick disk of the Galaxy. The
catalogue includes 743 stars with abundances of Fe, O, Mg, Ca, Ti, Si, Na, Ni
and Al in the metallicity range -1.30 < [Fe/H] < +0.50. We have checked that
systematic differences between abundances measured in the different studies
were lower than random errors before combining them. Accurate distances and
proper motions from Hipparcos, and radial velocities from several sources have
been retreived for 639 stars and their velocities (U,V,W) and galactic orbits
have been computed. Ages of 322 stars have been estimated with the Bayesian
method of isochrone fitting developped by Pont & Eyer (2004). Two samples
kinematically representative of the thin and thick disks have been selected,
taking into account the Hercules stream which is intermediate in kinematics,
but with a probable dynamical origin. [Abridged...]",2005-03-23T14:42:53Z
GALICS -- VI. Modelling Hierarchical Galaxy Formation in Clusters,"High-resolution N-body re-simulations of 15 massive (10^{14}-10^{15} Msun)
dark matter haloes have been combined with the hybrid galaxy formation model
GalICS (Hatton et al. 2003), to study the formation and evolution of galaxies
in clusters, within the framework of the hierarchical merging scenario. New
features in GalICS include a better description of galaxy positioning within
dark matter haloes, a more reliable computation of the temperature of the
inter-galactic medium as a function of redshift, and a description of the ram
pressure stripping process. We focus on the luminosity functions, morphological
fractions and colour distributions of galaxies in clusters and in cluster
outskirts, at z=0. No systematic dependency on cluster richness is found either
for the galaxy luminosity functions, morphological mixes, or colour
distributions. Moving from higher density (cluster cores), to lower density
environments (cluster outskirts), we detect a progressive flattening of the
luminosity functions, an increase of the fraction of spirals and a decrease of
that of ellipticals and S0s, and the progressive emergence of a bluer tail in
the distributions of galaxy colours, especially for spirals. As compared to
cluster spirals, early-type galaxies show a flatter luminosity function, and
more homogeneous and redder colours. An overall good agreement is found between
our results and the observations, particularly in terms of the cluster
luminosity functions and morphological mixes. However, some discrepancies are
also apparent, with too faint magnitudes of the brightest cluster members,
especially in the B band, and galaxy colours tendentially too red (or not blue
enough) in the model, with respect to the observations. Finally, ram pressure
stripping appears to affect very little our results.",2005-02-23T19:15:39Z
"Measuring the primordial power spectrum: Principal component analysis of
  the cosmic microwave background","We implement and investigate a method for measuring departures from
scale-invariance, both scale-dependent as well as scale-free, in the primordial
power spectrum of density perturbations using cosmic microwave background (CMB)
C_l data and a principal component analysis technique. The primordial power
spectrum is decomposed into a dominant scale-invariant Gaussian adiabatic
component plus a series of orthonormal modes whose detailed form only depends
the noise model for a particular CMB experiment. However, in general these
modes are localised across wavenumbers with 0.01 < k < 0.2 Mpc^-1, displaying
rapid oscillations on scales corresponding the acoustic peaks where the
sensitivity to primordial power spectrum is greatest. The performance of this
method is assessed using simulated data for the Planck satellite, and the full
cosmological plus power spectrum parameter space is integrated out using Markov
Chain Monte Carlo. As a proof of concept we apply this data compression
technique to the current CMB data from WMAP, ACBAR, CBI and VSA. We find no
evidence for the breaking of scale-invariance from measurements of four PCA
mode amplitudes, which is translated to a constraint on the scalar spectral
index n_S(k_0=0.04 Mpc^-1)=0.94+-0.04 in accordance with WMAP studies.",2005-06-16T17:48:08Z
"The GRB of 1999 January 23: prompt emission and broad-band afterglow
  modeling","We report on BeppoSAX simultaneous X- and gamma-ray observations of the
bright gamma-ray burst (GRB) 990123. We present the broad-band spectrum of the
prompt emission, including optical, X- and gamma-rays, confirming the
suggestion that the emission mechanisms at low and high frequencies must have
different physical origins. We discuss the X-ray afterglow observed by the
Narrow Field Instruments (NFIs) on board BeppoSAX and its hard X-ray emission
up to 60 keV several hours after the burst, in the framework of the standard

"Correcting the influence of an asymmetric line spread function in
  2-degree Field spectrograph data","We investigate the role of asymmetries in the line spread function of the
2-degree field spectrograph and the variations in these asymmetries with the
CCD, the plate, the time of observation and the fibre. A data-reduction
pipeline is developed that takes these deformations into account for the
calibration and cross-correlation of the spectra. We show that, using the
emission lines of calibration lamp observations, we can fit the line spread
function with the sum of two Gaussian functions representing the theoretical
signal and a perturbation of the system. This model is then used to calibrate
the spectra and generate templates by downgrading high resolution spectra.
Thus, we can cross-correlate the observed spectra with templates degraded in
the same way. Our reduction pipeline is tested on real observations and
provides a significant improvement in the accuracy of the radial velocities
obtained. In particular, the systematic errors that were as high as ~20 km/s
when applying the AAO reduction package 2dfDR are now reduced to ~5 km/s. Even
though the 2-degree Field spectrograph is to be decommissioned at the end of
2005, the analysis of archival data and previous studies could be improved by
the reduction procedure we propose here.",2005-03-31T15:32:40Z
"A deep Chandra observation of the Centaurus cluster: bubbles, filaments
  and edges","X-ray images and gas temperatures taken from a deep ~200 ks Chandra
observation of the Centaurus cluster are presented. Multiple inner bubbles and
outer semicircular edges are revealed, together with wispy filaments of soft
X-ray emitting gas. The frothy central structure and eastern edge are likely
due to the central radio source blowing bubbles in the intracluster gas. The
semicircular edges to the surface brightness maps 32kpc to the east and 17.5kpc
to the west are marked by sharp temperature increases and abundance drops. The
edges could be due to sloshing motions of the central potential, or are
possibly enhanced by earlier radio activity. The high abundance of the
innermost gas (about 2.5 times Solar) limits the amount of diffusion and mixing
taking place.",2005-03-07T16:40:34Z
A Leading Logarithm Approximation for Inflationary Quantum Field Theory,"During inflation explicit perturbative computations of quantum field theories
which contain massless, non-conformal fields exhibit secular effects that grow
as powers of the logarithm of the inflationary scale factor.
Starobinski\u{\i}'s technique of stochastic inflation not only reproduces the
leading infrared logarithms at each order in perturbation theory, it can
sometimes be summed to reveal what happens when inflation has proceeded so long
that the large logarithms overwhelm even very small coupling constants. It is
thus a cosmological analogue of what the renormalization group does for the
ultraviolet logarithms of quantum field theory, and generalizing this technique
to quantum gravity is a problem of great importance. There are two significant
differences between gravity and the scalar models for which stochastic
formulations have so far been given: derivative interactions and the presence
of constrained fields. We use explicit perturbative computations in two simple
scalar models to infer a set of rules for stochastically formulating theories
with these features.",2005-02-26T08:08:24Z
Stochastic Particle Acceleration in Parallel Relativistic Shocks,"We present results of test-particle simulations on both the first- and the
second-order Fermi acceleration for relativistic parallel shock waves. Our
studies suggest that the role of the second-order mechanism in the turbulent
downstream of a relativistic shock may have been underestimated in the past,
and that the stochastic mechanism may have significant effects on the form of
the particle spectra and its time evolution.",2005-03-03T14:08:30Z
"Structural Parameters of the Hot Pulsating B Subdwarf PG 1219+534 from
  Asteroseismology","We have carried out a detailed asteroseismic analysis of PG 1219+534. Our
analysis leads to the identification of the (k,l) indices of nine periods
observed in the star PG 1219+534, and to the determination of its structural
parameters. The periods all correspond to low-order acoustic modes with
adjacent values of k and with l=0, 1, 2, and 3. They define a band of unstable
modes, in close agreement with nonadiabatic pulsation theory. Furthermore, the
average dispersion between the nine observed periods and the periods of the
corresponding nine theoretical modes of the optimal model is only ~0.6%,
comparable to the results of a similar analysis carried out by Brassard et al.
(2001) on the rapid sdB pulsator PG 0014+067. On the basis of our combined
spectroscopic and asteroseismic analysis, the inferred global structural
parameters of PG 1219+534 are Teff = 33,600 +/- 370 K, log g = 5.8071 +/-
0.0057, log Menv/M* = -4.254 +/- 0.147, M* = 0.457 +/- 0.012 Msun, R/Rsun =
0.1397 +/- 0.0028, and L/Lsun = 22.01 +/- 1.85. Combined with detailed model
atmosphere calculations, we estimate, in addition, that this star has an
absolute visual magnitude MV = 4.62 +/- 0.06 and is located at a distance d =
531 +/- 23 pc (using V = 13.24 +/- 0.20). Finally, if we interpret the absence
of fine structure (frequency multiplets) as indicative of a slow rotation rate
of that star, we further find that PG 1219+534 rotates with a period longer
than 3.4 days, and has a maximum rotational broadening velocity of Vsin i <~
2.1 km/s.",2005-03-17T17:46:01Z
"Metal Abundances of KISS Galaxies. IV. Galaxian Luminosity-Metallicity
  Relations in the Optical and Near-IR","We explore the galaxian luminosity-metallicity (L-Z) relationship in both the
optical and the near-IR using a combination of optical photometric and
spectroscopic observations from the KPNO International Spectroscopic Survey
(KISS) and near-infrared photometry from the Two-micron All Sky Survey (2MASS).
We supplement the 2MASS data with our own NIR photometry for a small number of
lower-luminosity ELGs that are under-represented in the 2MASS database. Our
B-band L-Z relationship includes 765 star-forming KISS galaxies with coarse
abundance estimates from our follow-up spectra, while the correlation with KISS
and 2MASS yields a total of 420 galaxies in our J-band L-Z relationship. We
explore the effect that changing the correlation between the strong-line
abundance diagnostic R_23 and metallicity has on the derived L-Z relation. We
find that the slope of the L-Z relationship decreases as the wavelength of the
luminosity bandpass increases. We interpret this as being, at least in part, an
effect of internal absorption in the host galaxy. Furthermore, the dispersion
in the L-Z relation decreases for the NIR bands, suggesting that variations in
internal absorption contribute significantly to the observed scatter. We
propose that our NIR L-Z relations are more fundamental than the B-band
relation, since they are largely free of absorption effects and the NIR
luminosities are more directly related to the stellar mass of the galaxy than
are the optical luminosities.",2005-02-09T21:00:18Z
"Three Dimensional Evolution of a Relativistic Current Sheet : Triggering
  of Magnetic Reconnection by the Guide Field","The linear and non-linear evolution of a relativistic current sheet of pair
($e^{\pm}$) plasmas is investigated by three-dimensional particle-in-cell
simulations. In a Harris configuration, it is obtained that the magnetic energy
is fast dissipated by the relativistic drift kink instability (RDKI). However,
when a current-aligned magnetic field (the so-called ""guide field"") is
introduced, the RDKI is stabilized by the magnetic tension force and it
separates into two obliquely-propagating modes, which we call the relativistic
drift-kink-tearing instability (RDKTI). These two waves deform the current
sheet so that they trigger relativistic magnetic reconnection at a crossover
thinning point. Since relativistic reconnection produces a lot of non-thermal
particles, the guide field is of critical importance to study the energetics of
a relativistic current sheet.",2005-05-24T17:19:17Z
"Relativistic solutions to the problem of jets with time-dependent
  injection velocities","We present a ballistic description of the propagation of the working surface
of a relativistic jet. Using simple laws of conservation of mass and linear
momentum at the working surface, we obtain a full description of the jet flow
parametrised by the initial velocity and mass injection. This analysis will
soon be applied to particular cases of time-dependent injection of mass and
velocity into the jet.",2005-03-15T03:45:49Z
"Finite Source Effects in Strong Lensing: Implications for the
  Substructure Mass Scale","Flux ratio `anomalies' in quadruply-imaged gravitational lenses can be
explained with galactic substructure of the sort predicted by CDM, but the
strength and uniqueness of that hypothesis needs to be further assessed. A good
way to do that is to use the physical scale associated with the size of the
source quasar, and its dependence on wavelength. We develop an analytic toy
model to study finite source effects in substructure lensing and identify
general principles. We find that image positions and magnifications are
basically independent of source size until the source is large enough to
intersect a substructure caustic. Even sources that are much larger than the
substructure Einstein radius can be perturbed at a detectable level. A
tremendous amount could be learned by comparing image positions and
magnifications at wavelengths that correspond to different source sizes.
  In a separate analysis, we carefully study four observed radio lenses to
determine which of the images are anomalous. In B0712+472, if the flux ratio
anomaly is real it is probably in image C. In B1422+231, the anomaly is in
image A. Interestingly, B2045+265 and B1555+375 both appear to have two
anomalous images. It remains to be seen whether CDM predicts enough
substructure to explain multiple anomalies in multiple lenses. When we join our
modeling results and substructure theory, we obtain lower bounds on the masses
of the substructures responsible for the observed anomalies. The mass bounds
are broadly consistent with expectations for CDM. Perhaps more importantly, we
outline various systematic effects in the mass bounds; poor knowledge of
whether the substructure lies within the main lens galaxy or elsewhere along
the line of sight appears to be the dominant systematic. [Abridged]",2005-02-21T22:02:40Z
"INTEGRAL IGR J18135-1751=HESS J1813-178: A new cosmic high energy
  accelerator from keV to TeV","We report the discovery of a soft gamma ray source, namely IGR J18135-1751,
detected with the IBIS imager on board the INTEGRAL satellite. The source is
persistent and has a 20-100 keV luminosity of $\sim$5.7 $\times$ 10$^{34}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ (assuming a distance of 4kpc). This source is coincident with one of
the eight unidentified objects recently reported by the HESS collaboration as
part of the first TeV survey of the inner part of the Galaxy. Two of these new
sources found along the Galactic plane, HESS J1813-178 and HESS J1614-518, have
no obvious lower energy counterpart, a fact that motivated the suggestion that
they might be dark cosmic ray accelerators. HESS J1813-178 has a strongly
absorbed X-ray counterpart, the ASCA source AGPS273.4-17.8, showing a power law
spectrum with photon index $\sim$ 1.8 and a total (galactic plus intrinsic)
absorption corresponding to N$_H$ $\sim$5 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. We
hypothesize that the source is a pulsar wind nebula embedded in its supernova
remnant. The lack of X/gamma-ray variability, the radio morphology and the ASCA
spectrum are all compatible with this interpretation. In any case we rule out
the hypothesis that HESS J1813-178 belongs to a new class of TeV objects or
that it is a cosmic ""dark particle"" accelerator.",2005-05-10T13:19:53Z
Fitting Non-Minimally Coupled Scalar Models to Gold SnIa Dataset,"Non-minimally coupled theories of special potentials are analyzed
numerically. Such theories yield equations of state $\omega<-1$ and
oscillations of the cosmological expansion, which are favored by the recent
analysis of observations. Fitting these theories to the Gold SnIa dataset, we
obtain results comparable with other models. A potential of the form
$V(\phi)=V_0e^{a_1\phi^2}$ yields $\chi^2_{min}=170.127$. Similar results are
obtained for potentials of the form $V(\phi)=V_0+a_1\phi^n$.",2005-06-04T08:32:20Z
The Southern Galactic Plane Survey: HI Observations and Analysis,"We describe the HI component of the Southern Galactic Plane Survey (SGPS).
The SGPS is a large-scale project to image at arcminute resolution the HI
spectral line and 21 cm continuum emission in parts of the plane of the Milky
Way. The survey covers Galactic longitudes 253 deg < l < 358 deg and latitudes
|b| <1.5 deg (SGPS I), plus a first quadrant extension covering 5 deg < l < 20
deg and |b| <1.5 deg (SGPS II). The survey combines data from the Australia
Telescope Compact Array and the Parkes Radio Telescope for sensitivity to
angular scales ranging from 2 arcminutes to several degrees. The combined data
cover 325 sq-deg and have an rms sensitivity of 1.6 K. Here we describe the HI
observations and data reduction in detail, and present examples from the final
data products. The complete dataset is publicly available through the Australia
Telescope National Facility's HI Surveys archive. This dataset provides an
unprecedented view of the neutral component of interstellar hydrogen in the
inner Milky Way.",2005-03-07T03:42:32Z
Cosmological perturbations for imperfect fluids,"Interacting fluids, endowed with bulk viscous stresses, are discussed in a
unified perspective with the aim of generalizing the treatment of cosmological
perturbation theory to the case where both fluctuating decay rates and
fluctuating bulk viscosity coefficients are simultaneously present in the
relativistic plasma. A gauge-invariant treatment of the qualitatively new
phenomena arising in this context is provided. In a complementary approach,
faithful gauge-fixed descriptions of the gravitational and hydrodynamical
fluctuations are developed and exploited. To deepen the interplay between bulk
viscous stresses and fluctuating decay rates, illustrative examples are
proposed and discussed both analytically and numerically. Particular attention
is paid to the coupled evolution of curvature and entropy fluctuations when, in
the relativistic plasma, at least one of the interacting fluids possesses a
fluctuating bulk viscosity coefficient. It is argued that this class of models
may be usefully employed as an effective description of the decay of the
inflaton as well as of other phenomena involving imperfect relativistic fluids.",2005-04-29T08:24:05Z
Adhesive Gravitational Clustering,"The notion of `adhesion' has been advanced for the phenomenon of
stabilization of large-scale structure emerging from gravitational instability
of a cold medium. Recently, the physical origin of adhesion has been
identified: a systematic derivation of the equations of motion for the density
and the velocity fields leads naturally to the key equation of the `adhesion
approximation' - however, under a set of strongly simplifying assumptions. In
this work, we provide an evaluation of the current status of adhesive
gravitational clustering and a clear explanation of the assumptions involved.
Furthermore, we propose systematic generalizations with the aim to relax some
of the simplifying assumptions. We start from the general Newtonian evolution
equations for self-gravitating particles on an expanding Friedmann background
and recover the popular `dust model' (pressureless fluid), which breaks down
after the formation of density singularities; then we investigate, in a unified
framework, two other models which, under the restrictions referred to above,
lead to the `adhesion approximation'. We apply the Eulerian and Lagrangian
perturbative expansions to these new models and, finally, we discuss some
non-perturbative results that may serve as starting points for workable
approximations of non-linear structure formation in the multi-stream regime. In
particular, we propose a new approximation that includes, in limiting cases,
the standard `adhesion model' and the Eulerian as well as Lagrangian
first-order approximations.",2005-02-16T15:30:40Z
Development of Kolmogorov spectrum in the pulsar radio emission,"It is shown that the scattering of electromagnetic waves by Langmuir ones
taking into the account the electric drift motion of particles, is the most
intense nonlinear process and should be responsible for the formation of
radiation spectrum of radio pulsars. Performed analysis indicates that in the
case of existence of inertial interval formation of stationary spectra is
possible. Analysis of linear mechanisms of wave generation and silk allows to
conclude that only possible stationary solution has spectral index $\alpha
=-1.5$. Obtained spectrum is in good agreement with observational data.",2005-05-12T14:07:16Z
"H-alpha Imaging of Early-type (Sa-Sab) Spiral Galaxies II. Global
  Properties","New results, based on one of the most comprehensive H-alpha imaging surveys
of nearby Sa-Sab spirals completed to date, reveals early-type spirals to be a
diverse group of galaxies that span a wide range in massive star formation
rates. While the majority of Sa-Sab galaxies in our sample are forming stars at
a modest rate, a significant fraction (~29%) exhibit star formation rates
greater than 1 M(solar/yr), rivaling the most prolifically star forming
late-type spirals. A similar diversity is apparent in the star formation
history of Sa-Sab spirals as measured by their H-alpha equivalent widths.
Consistent with our preliminary results presented in the first paper in this
series, we find giant HII regions (L(H-alpha)>10^{39}erg/s) in the disks of 37%
of early-type spirals. We suspect that recent minor mergers or past
interactions are responsible for the elevated levels of H-alpha emission and
perhaps, for the presence of giant HII regions in these galaxies.",2005-06-02T20:55:41Z
Dark Matter Dynamics and Indirect Detection,"Non-baryonic, or ""dark,"" matter is believed to be a major component of the
total mass budget of the universe. We review the candidates for particle dark
matter and discuss the prospects for direct detection (via interaction of dark
matter particles with laboratory detectors) and indirect detection (via
observations of the products of dark matter self-annihilations), focusing in
particular on the Galactic center, which is among the most promising targets
for indirect detection studies. The gravitational potential at the Galactic
center is dominated by stars and by the supermassive black hole, and the dark
matter distribution is expected to evolve on sub-parsec scales due to
interaction with these components. We discuss the dominant interaction
mechanisms and show how they can be used to rule out certain extreme models for
the dark matter distribution, thus increasing the information that can be
gleaned from indirect detection searches.",2005-04-19T19:47:40Z
"Warp signatures of the Galactic disk as seen in mid infrared from
  Midcourse Space Experiment","The gross features in the distribution of stars as well as warm (T >~ 100 K)
interstellar dust in the Galactic disk have been investigated using the recent
mid infrared survey by Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) at 8, 12, 14 & 21
micron bands. An attempt has been made to determine the location of the
Galactic mid-plane at various longitudes, using two approaches : (i) fitting
exponential functions to the latitude profiles and (ii) statistical
indicators.The former method is successful for the inner Galaxy (-90 < l < 90),
and quantifies characteristic angular scales along latitude, which have been
translated to linear scale heights (z_h) and radial length scales (R_l) using
geometric description of the Galactic disk. The distribution of warm dust in
the Galactic disk is found to be characterised by R_l < 6 kpc and 60 < z_h <~
100 pc, in agreement with other studies. The location of the Galactic mid-plane
as a function of longitude, for stars as well as warm dust, has been searched
for signatures of warp-like feature in their distribution, by fitting sinusoid
with phase and amplitude as parameters. In every case, the warp signature has
been detected. An identical analysis of the DIRBE/COBE data in all its ten
bands covering the entire infrared spectrum (1.25-240 micron), also leads to
detection of warp signatures with very similar phase as found from the MSX
data. Our results have been compared with those from other studies.",2005-03-17T13:28:14Z
"Fluorescent Ly-alpha emission from the high-redshift intergalactic
  medium","We combine a high-resolution hydro-simulation of the LambdaCDM cosmology with
two radiative transfer schemes (for continuum and line radiation) to predict
the properties, spectra and spatial distribution of fluorescent Ly-alpha
emission at z~3. We focus on line radiation produced by recombinations in the
dense intergalactic medium ionized by UV photons. In particular, we consider
both a uniform background and the case where gas clouds are illuminated by a
nearby quasar. We find that the emission from optically thick regions is
substantially less than predicted from the widely used static, plane-parallel
model. The effects induced by a realistic velocity field and by the complex
geometric structure of the emitting regions are discussed in detail. We make
predictions for the expected brightness and size distributions of the
fluorescent sources.Our results account for recent null detections and can be
used to plan new observational campaigns both in the field (to measure the
intensity of the diffuse UV background) and in the proximity of bright quasars
(to understand the origin of high colum-density absorbers).",2005-04-01T13:34:13Z
X-ray Bursts from the Transient Magnetar Candidate XTE J1810-197,"We have discovered four X-ray bursts, recorded with the Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer Proportional Counter Array between 2003 September and 2004 April, that
we show to originate from the transient magnetar candidate XTE J1810-197. The
burst morphologies consist of a short spike or multiple spikes lasting ~1 s
each followed by extended tails of emission where the pulsed flux from XTE
J1810-197 is significantly higher. The burst spikes are likely correlated with
the pulse maxima, having a chance probability of a random phase distribution of
0.4%. The burst spectra are best fit to a blackbody with temperatures 4-8 keV,
considerably harder than the persistent X-ray emission. During the X-ray tails
following these bursts, the temperature rapidly cools as the flux declines,
maintaining a constant emitting radius after the initial burst peak. During the
brightest X-ray tail, we detect a narrow emission line at 12.6 keV with an
equivalent width of 1.4 keV and a probability of chance occurrence less than 4
x 10^-6. The temporal and spectral characteristics of these bursts closely
resemble the bursts seen from 1E 1048.1-5937 and a subset of the bursts
detected from 1E 2259+586, thus establishing XTE J1810-197 as a magnetar
candidate. The bursts detected from these three objects are sufficiently
similar to one another, yet significantly different from those seen from soft
gamma repeaters, that they likely represent a new class of bursts from magnetar
candidates exclusive (thus far) to the anomalous X-ray pulsar-like sources.",2005-05-02T20:05:06Z
"Interstellar 12C/13C ratios through CH+ ll 3957,4232 absorption in local
  clouds: incomplete mixing in the ISM","The 12C/13C isotope ratio is a tracer of stellar yields and the efficiency of
mixing in the ISM. 12CH+/13CH+ is not affected by interstellar chemistry, and
is the most secure way of measuring 12C/13C in the diffuse ISM. R= 12C/13C is
90 in the solar system. Previous measurements of 12CH+ ll3957.7,4232.3 and
13CH+ ll3958.2,4232.0 absorption toward nearby stars indicate some variations
in 12C/13C, with values ranging from 40 to 90 suggesting inefficient mixing.
Except for the cloud toward zeta Oph, these R values are strongly affected by
noise. With UVES on the VLT we have improved on the previous interstellar
12C/13C measurements. The weighted 12C/13C ratio in the local ISM is 78.27 +-
1.83, while the weighted dispersion of our measurements is 12.7, giving a 6.9
sigma scatter. Thus we report on a 6.9 sigma detection of 16.2%
root-mean-square variations in the carbon isotopic ratio on scales of ~100 pc:
R= 74.7 +- 2.3 in the zetaOph cloud, while R = 88.6 +- 3.0 toward HD152235 in
the Lupus clouds, R = 62.2 +- 5.3 towards HD110432 in the Coalsack, and R =
98.9 +- 10.1 toward HD170740. The observed variations in 13C/12C are the first
significant detection of chemical heterogeneity in the local ISM.",2005-06-03T16:34:07Z
X-ray Variability of Active Galactic Nuclei and the Flare Model,"Short-term variability of X-ray spectra has been reported for several Active
Galactic Nuclei. Significant X-ray flux variations are observed within time
scales down to 10^4 -- 10^5 seconds. We discuss short variability time scales
in the framework of the X-ray flare model, which assumes the release of a large
hard X-ray flux above a small portion of the accretion disk. The resulting
observed X-ray spectrum is composed of the primary radiation as well as a
reprocessed/Compton reflection component that we model performing numerical
radiative transfer simulations. We conduct Monte-Carlo simulations of large
flare distributions across the disk including relativistic corrections of the
observed radiation and discuss general implications on AGN spectra and their
variability.",2005-04-06T12:43:23Z
VLTI observations of AGB stars,"We report on recent observations of AGB stars obtained with the VLT
Interferometer (VLTI). We illustrate in general the potential of
interferometric measurements to study stellar atmospheres and circumstellar
envelopes, and demonstrate in particular the advantages of a coordinated
multi-wavelength approach including near/mid-infrared as well as radio
interferometry. We report on studies of the atmospheric structure of non-Mira
and Mira variable giants. We have used VLTI observations of the near- and
mid-infrared stellar sizes and concurrent VLBA observations of the SiO maser
emission. So far, this project includes studies of the Mira stars S Ori and RR
Aql as well as of the supergiant AH Sco. The results from our first epochs of S
Ori measurements have recently been published and the main results are reviewed
here. The S Ori maser ring is found to lie at a mean distance of approximately
2 stellar radii, a result that is virtually free of the usual uncertainty
inherent in comparing observations of variable stars widely separated in time
and stellar phase. We discuss the status of our more recent S Ori, RR Aql, and
AH Sco observations, and present an outlook on the continuation of our project.",2005-05-12T11:33:50Z
The $Ω_{DE}-Ω_{M}$ Plane in Dark Energy Cosmology,"The dark energy cosmology with the equation of state $w=constant$ is

methods of reference stars selection, differential color refraction

acquired at the 0.9-m at CTIO, full astrometric solutions and $VRIJHK_s$
photometry are presented for 36 red and white dwarf stellar systems with proper

of the emission line nebulae in the compact steep spectrum radio sources 3C 67,

al. 1981) diagnostic emission line ratios for the nebulae which are consistent
with a mix of shock excitation and photoionization in the extended gas. In
addition, line ratios indicative of lower ionization gas are found to be
associated with higher gas velocities. The results are consistent with a

ionizing and accelerating them.",2005-04-14T15:47:02Z
"Detecting the stochastic gravitational wave background using pulsar

astrophysics. We provide details of a new method for detecting a stochastic
background of gravitational waves using pulsar timing data. Our results show
that regular timing observations of 40 pulsars each with a timing accuracy of
100 nano-seconds will be able to make a direct detection of the predicted
stochastic background from coalescing black holes within five years. With an
improved pre-whitening algorithm, or if the background is at the upper end of

pulsars.",2005-04-21T05:49:46Z
"Three-Dimensional Numerical Simulations of Thermal-Gravitational
  Instability in Protogalactic Halo Environment","We study thermal-gravitational instability in simplified models for
protogalactic halos using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. The
simulations followed the evolution of gas with radiative cooling down to T =
10^4 K, background heating, and self-gravity. Then cooled and condensed clouds
were identified and their physical properties were examined in detail. During
early stage clouds start to form around initial density peaks by thermal
instability. Small clouds appear first and they are pressure-bound.
Subsequently, the clouds grow through compression by the background pressure as
well as gravitational infall. During late stage cloud-cloud collisions become
important, and clouds grow mostly through gravitational merging.
Gravitationally bound clouds with mass M_c > ~6 X 10^6 Msun are found in the
late stage. They are approximately in virial equilibrium and have radius R_c =
\~150 - 200 pc. Those clouds have gained angular momentum through tidal torque
as well as merging, so they have large angular momentum with the spin parameter
<lambda_s> ~ 0.3. The clouds formed in a denser background tend to have smaller
spin parameters. We discuss briefly the implications of our results on the
formation of protoglobular cluster clouds in protogalactic halos. (abridged)",2005-06-08T05:46:35Z
The infrared-dominated jet of 3C401,"We present a Hubble Space Telescope image of the FRII radio galaxy 3C 401,
obtained at 1.6 microns with the NICMOS camera in which we identify the
infrared counterpart of the brightest region of the radio jet. The jet has a
complex radio structure and brightens where bending occurs, most likely as a
result of relativistic beaming. We analyze archival data in the radio, optical
and X-ray bands and we derive its spectral energy distribution. Differently
from all of the previously known optical extragalactic jets, the jet in 3C401
is not detected in the X-rays even in a long 48ksec X-ray Chandra exposure and
the infrared emission dominates the overall SED. We propose that the dominant
radiation mechanism of this jet is synchrotron. The low X-ray emission is then
caused by two different effects: i) the lack of any strong external photon
field and ii) the shape of the electron distribution. This affects the location
of the synchrotron peak in the SED, resulting in a sharp cut-off at energies
lower than the X-rays. Thus 3C401 shows a new type of jet which has
intermediate spectral properties between those of FRI, which are dominated by
synchrotron emission up to X-ray energies, and FRII/QSO, which show a strong
high-energy emission due to inverse-Compton scattering of external photons.
This might be a clue for the presence of a continuous ``sequence'' in the

proposed for sub-pc scale jets.",2005-05-02T19:48:36Z
FIRBACK IV: Towards the nature of the 170microns source population,"We present a detailed study of the brighter ($> 4\sigma$ detections) sources
in the 170$\mu$m FIRBACK northern N1 ISO survey, with the help of complementary
data in the optical, radio, and mid-IR domain. For 82% of them, an optical
galaxy counterpart is identified, either as the unique source of the IR
emission, or as part of a multiple identification. With less than 15% of AGNs,
these sources are essentially local, moderate starbursters with a dominating
cold dust component. and represent a population of cold galaxies rather
neglected up to now. Their colours do not match those of the far-IR Cosmic IR
Background (CIB), to which they contribute less than 5%. The bulk of the
sources contributing to the CIB is thus to be searched for in more distant
galaxies, possibly counterparts of the fainter FIRBACK sources still under
study. These bright, local, galaxies however play an important role in the
evolution of IR galaxies: they dominate the number counts at high 170 $\mu$m
fluxes, and represent half of the contribution at 250 mJy. Although not
particularly massive (typically M*), they form more stars than a typical spiral
galaxy and many are bulge dominated, that could represent the remnant of a
former merger. The fainter part of this population may represent the missing
link with the higher-z sources found in sub-mm observations.",2005-04-15T11:27:33Z
A Virgo high-resolution Halpha kinematical survey: I. NGC 4438,"New Halpha emission-line observations of the Virgo cluster galaxy NGC 4438
are presented. Fabry-Perot interferometry data at an effective angular
resolution of
  ~2"" are used to map the kinematics of the ionized gas in the galaxy. For the
first time we obtain a velocity field covering a large area in NGC 4438, much
larger than that deduced from previous HI and CO maps. The kinematics of the
extended, low surface brightness Halpha filaments to the West of the galactic
disk is discussed. We report on the discovery of a northern Halpha structure
which is clumpier than the other filaments. Evidence for multiple spectral
components through the data-cube are presented in a nuclear shell and in the
approaching half of the disk. The role of VCC 1040, a dwarf elliptical galaxy
located to the South of NGC 4438, is presented to investigate the origin of a
small-scale stellar tail of NGC 4438. It could be due to a minor tidal
interaction between the two galaxies.",2005-03-07T16:06:34Z
"Runaway core collapse and cluster survival: where are the parent
  clusters of ULXs?","Accreting intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) have been proposed as an
explanation for ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). Runaway core collapse
inside a massive cluster is a possible mechanism for IMBH formation. But if so,
why are ULXs only rarely found associated with a cluster? We use a simple
analytical approximation to show that rapid core collapse can occur in two
physical regimes. For cluster masses ~ 10^6 M_sun, an IMBH may be formed if the
collapse timescale is <~ 3 Myr, as already well known; the parent cluster is
expected to survive. For cluster masses ~ 10^5 M_sun, an IMBH may result from a
core collapse on even shorter timescales (~ 0.5 Myr), when the protocluster is
still embedded in optically thick gas. Most clusters in this latter regime are
disrupted ``explosively'' as soon as the gas is ionized by the OB stars. We
speculate that this process may produce isolated ULXs with masses up to a few
10^2 M_sun, surrounded by a loose OB association, and perhaps by a nebula,
remnant of the expanding gas from the disrupted protocluster.",2005-03-16T11:44:10Z
"Chandra observations of the millisecond X-ray pulsar IGR J00291+5934 in
  quiescence","In this Paper we report on our analysis of three Chandra observations of the
accretion-powered millisecond X-ray pulsar IGR J00291+5934 obtained during the
late stages of the 2004 outburst. We also report the serendipitous detection of
the source in quiescence by ROSAT during MJD 48830-48839. The detected 0.3-10
keV source count rates varied significantly between the Chandra observations
from (7.2+-1.2)x10^-3, (6.8+-0.9)x10^-3, and (1.4+-0.1)x10^-2 counts per second
for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Chandra observation, on MJD 53371.88, 53383.99, and
53407.57, respectively. The count rate for the 3rd observation is 2.0+-0.4
times as high as that of the average of the first two observations. The
unabsorbed 0.5-10 keV source flux for the best-fit power-law model to the
source spectrum was (7.9+-2.5)x10^-14, (7.3+-2.0)x10^-14, and
(1.17+-0.22)x10^-13 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Chandra
observation, respectively. We find that this source flux is consistent with
that found by ROSAT [~(5.4+-2.4)x10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1]. Under the assumption
that the interstellar extinction, N_H, does not vary between the observations,
we find that the blackbody temperature during the 2nd Chandra observation is
significantly higher than that during the 1st and 3rd observation. Furthermore,
the effective temperature of the neutron star derived from fitting an absorbed
blackbody or neutron star atmosphere model to the data is rather high in
comparison with many other neutron star soft X-ray transients in quiescence,
even during the 1st and 3rd observation. If we assume that the source quiescent
luminosity is similar to that measured for two other accretion powered
millisecond pulsars in quiescence, the distance to IGR J00291+5934 is 2.6-3.6
kpc.",2005-05-06T10:44:14Z
Inflation with violation of the null energy condition,"Inflation may have been driven by a component which violated the Null-Energy
Condition, thereby leading to {\it super inflation}. We provide the formalism
to study cosmological perturbations when such a component is described by a
scalar field with arbitrary Lagrangian. Since the background curvature grows
with time, gravitational waves always have a blue spectrum. Scalar
perturbations may also have a blue spectrum, {\em albeit} in single field
models. We apply our formalism to the case of phantom inflation with an
exponential potential (whose pole-like inflationary stage is an attractor for
inhomogeneous cosmological models for any value of the potential slope). We
finally compare the predictions of super inflation with those of standard
inflation stressing the role of gravitational waves.",2005-05-27T13:07:36Z
"Merging Galaxies in Goods-s: First Extragalactic Results from Keck Laser
  Adaptive Optics","The Center for Adaptive Optics Treasury Survey (CATS) aims to combine deep
HST images in the optical with deep Keck adaptive optics (AO) data in the
near-infrared (NIR) to study distant galaxies, AGN, and supernovae. We recently
achieved an important new milestone by securing the first Keck laser guide star
AO image of faint galaxies. Six galaxies with redshifts ranging from 0.3-1.0
were targeted in one pointing in the GOODS-S field. Two are Chandra Deep Field
South sources, XID-56 and XID-536, with complex morphologies suggestive of
recent merger activity. Substructures seen in the NIR AO image (FWHM ~ 0.1""),
including multiple tight knots in XID-56 and a double nucleus in XID-536, are
confirmed in the optical HST images. These structures are unresolved in the
best seeing-limited (FWHM ~ 0.5"") NIR images. Stellar population synthesis
models of the substructures indicate that XID-56 is a gas rich merger with a
recent burst of star formation and significant amounts of dust. XID-536 appears
to be a merger of two evolved stellar populations.",2005-04-08T01:21:09Z
"Spectral Properties of Interstellar Turbulence via Velocity Channel
  Analysis","In this presentation we review the link between the statistics of intensity
fluctuations in spectral line data cubes with underlying statistical properties
of turbulence in the interstellar medium. Both the formalism of Velocity
Channel Analysis for optically thin lines and its extension to the lines with
self-absorption is described. We demonstrate that by observing optically thin
lines from cold gas in sufficiently narrow (thin) velocity channels one may
recover the scaling of the stochastic velocities from turbulent cascade, in
particular, Kolmogorov velocities give $K^{-2.7}$ contribution to the intensity
power spectrum. Synthetically increasing the channel thickness separates out
the underlying density inhomogeneities of the gas. Effects of self absorption,
on the other hand, retain the velocity signature even for integrated lines. As
a result, intensity fluctuations tend to show universal but featureless scaling
of the power $\propto K^{-3}$ over the range of scales.",2005-05-28T22:36:01Z
Stellar Photometry and Astrometry with Discrete Point Spread Functions,"The key features of the MATPHOT algorithm for precise and accurate stellar
photometry and astrometry using discrete Point Spread Functions are described.
A discrete Point Spread Function (PSF) is a sampled version of a continuous PSF
which describes the two-dimensional probability distribution of photons from a
point source (star) just above the detector. The shape information about the
photon scattering pattern of a discrete PSF is typically encoded using a
numerical table (matrix) or a FITS image file. Discrete PSFs are shifted within
an observational model using a 21-pixel-wide damped sinc function and position
partial derivatives are computed using a five-point numerical differentiation
formula. Precise and accurate stellar photometry and astrometry is achieved
with undersampled CCD observations by using supersampled discrete PSFs that are
sampled 2, 3, or more times more finely than the observational data. The
precision and accuracy of the MATPHOT algorithm is demonstrated by using the
C-language MPD code to analyze simulated CCD stellar observations; measured
performance is compared with a theoretical performance model. Detailed analysis
of simulated Next Generation Space Telescope observations demonstrate that
millipixel relative astrometry and millimag photometric precision is achievable
with complicated space-based discrete PSFs. For further information about
MATPHOT and MPD, including source code and documentation, see

VLA 3.5 cm continuum sources in the Serpens cloud core,"We present VLA 3.5 cm continuum observations of the Serpens cloud core. 22
radio continuum sources are detected. 16 out of the 22 cm sources are suggested
to be associated with young stellar objects (Class 0, Class I, flat-spectrum,
and Class II) of the young Serpens cluster. The rest of the VLA sources
plausibly are background objects. Most of the Serpens cm sources likely
represent thermal radio jets; on the other hand, the radio continuum emission
of some sources could be due to a gyrosynchroton mechanism arising from
coronally active young stars. The Serpens VLA sources are spatially distributed
into two groups; one of them located towards the NW clump of the Serpens core,
where only Class 0 and Class I protostars are found to present cm emission, and
a second group located towards the SE clump, where radio continuum sources are
associated with objects in evolutionary classes from Class 0 to Class II. This
subgrouping is similar to that found in the near IR, mid-IR and mm wavelength
regimes.",2005-06-02T10:50:41Z
The GRB 030328 host: another case of a blue starburst galaxy,"We present for the first time the detection of the GRB 030328 host galaxy in
four optical bands equivalent to UBRI. The host galaxy spectral energy
distribution is consistent with a low extinction (E(B-V) < 0.21) starburst
galaxy. The restframe B-band magnitude of the host is M_B ~ -20.4",2005-04-04T07:57:30Z
"R-Modes on Rapidly Rotating, Relativistic Stars : II. Blackbody Emission","Rossby waves (or r-modes) on the surface of a neutron star have become a
leading model for the oscillations observed during the tail of Type-I X-ray
bursts. Their frequency evolution matches well with the observed frequency
drifts of the oscillations in the bursts, and the burning appears to excite
these waves quite naturally. This paper addresses the detailed shape of the
expected flux profiles from r-modes on neutron stars as a function of energy.
R-modes naturally account for both the small amplitude of the observed
oscillations and their lack of harmonic content. However, the model predicts
that the oscillation at higher energies leads the lower energy variation. The
observed oscillations have the opposite trend which possibly indicates that the
higher energy photons are upscattered in the plasma surrounding the neutron
star and therefore delayed.",2005-02-24T20:04:00Z
Metallicity dependence of the Blazhko effect,"The microlensing surveys, such as OGLE or MACHO, have led to the discovery of
thousands of RR Lyrae stars in the Galactic Bulge and in the Magellanic Clouds,
allowing for detailed investigation of these stars, specially the still
mysterious Blazhko phenomenon. Higher incidence rate of Blazhko (BL) variables
in the more metal-rich Galactic Bulge than in the LMC, suggests that occurance
of Blazhko effect correlates with metallicity (Moskalik and Poretti 2003). To
investigate this problem, we calibrate the photometric method of determining
the metallicity of the RRab star (Kovacs and Zsoldos 1995) to the I-band and
apply it to the OGLE Galactic Bulge and LMC data. In both systems,
metallicities of non Blazhko and Blazhko variables are close to each other. The
LMC Blazhko pulsators prefer slightly lower metallicities. The different
metallicities of the Galactic Bulge and the LMC, can't explain the observed
incidence rates.
  As a by-product of our metallicity estimates, we investigate the
luminosity-metallicity relation, finding a steep dependence of the luminosity
on [Fe/H]",2005-03-29T10:04:17Z
"The effect of the 19F(alpha,p)22Ne reaction rate uncertainty on the
  yield of fluorine from Wolf-Rayet Stars","In the light of recent recalculations of the \el{19}{F}(alpha,p)\el{22}{Ne}
reaction rate we present results of the expected yield of \el{19}{F} from
Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. We have computed models using the upper and lower limits
for the rate in addition to the recommended rate and hence we constrain the
uncertainty in the yield with respect to this reaction. We find a yield of
3.1x10^{-4}M_sol of \el{19}{F} with our recommended rate and a difference of a
factor of two between the yields computed with the upper and lower limits. In
comparison with previous work we find a difference in the yield of
approximately a factor of 4, connected to a different choice of mass loss.
Model uncertainties must be carefully evaluated in order to obtain a reliable
estimate of the yield of fluorine from WR stars together with its
uncertainties.",2005-04-06T21:31:39Z
"Star Formation Histories of Nearby Elliptical Galaxies: I. Volume
  Limited Sample","This work presents high $S/N$ spectroscopic observations of a representative
sample of nearby elliptical galaxies. These observations provide a strong test
of models for the formation of elliptical galaxies and their star formation
histories. Combining these data with the Gonzalez (1993) data set, a volume
limited sample of 45 galaxies has been defined. Results are in agreement with
previous studies: the existence of the metallicity hyper-plane and the Z-plane
of Trager et al. (2000) is confirmed, and the distribution is clearly due to
physical variations in stellar population parameters and not measurement
uncertainty. Trends between stellar population parameters and galaxy structural
parameters suggest that angular momentum may determine the chemical abundance
of a galaxy at a given mass.",2005-06-17T20:14:54Z
The role of black hole mass in quasar radio activity,"We use a homogeneous sample of about 300, 0.3 <~ z <~ 3, radio-loud quasars
drawn from the FIRST and 2dF QSO surveys to investigate a possible dependence
of radio activity on black-hole mass. By analyzing composite spectra for the
populations of radio-quiet and radio-loud QSOs -- chosen to have the same
redshift and luminosity distribution -- we find with high statistical
significance that radio-loud quasars are on average associated with black holes
of masses ~10^{8.6} M_sun, about twice as large as those measured for
radio-quiet quasars (~10^{8.3} M_sun). We also find a clear dependence of black
hole mass on optical luminosity of the form log (M_BH/M_sun)_{RL}= 8.57(\pm
0.06) - 0.27(\pm 0.06) (M_B + 24.5) and log (M_BH/M_sun)_{RQ}= 8.43(\pm 0.05)
-0.32(\pm 0.06) (M_B + 24.5), respectively for the case of radio-loud and
radio-quiet quasars. It is intriguing to note that these two trends run roughly
parallel to each other, implying that radio-loud quasars are associated to
black holes more massive than those producing the radio-quiet case at all
sampled luminosities. On the other hand, in the case of radio-loud quasars, we
find evidence for only a weak (if any) dependence of the black hole mass on
radio power. The above findings seem to support the belief that there exists --
at a given optical luminosity -- a threshold black hole mass associated with
the onset of significant radio activity such as that of radio-loud QSOs;
however, once the activity is triggered, there appears to be very little
connection between black hole mass and level of radio output.",2005-05-10T14:54:57Z
Magnetars,"P-stars are compact stars made of up and down quarks in beta-equilibrium with
electrons in a chromomagnetic condensate. P-stars are able to account for
compact stars like RXJ 1856.5-3754 and RXJ 0720.4-3125, stars with radius
comparable with canonical neutron stars, as well as super massive compact
objects like SgrA*. We discuss p-stars endowed with super strong dipolar
magnetic field which, following consolidated tradition in literature, are
referred to as magnetars. We show that soft gamma-ray repeaters and anomalous
X-ray pulsars can be understood within our theory. We find a well defined
criterion to distinguish rotation powered pulsars from magnetic powered
pulsars. We show that glitches, that in our magnetars are triggered by magnetic
dissipative effects in the inner core, explain both the quiescent emission and
bursts in soft gamma-ray repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars. We are able to
account for the braking glitch from SGR 1900+14 and the normal glitch from AXP
1E 2259+586 following a giant burst. We discuss and explain the observed anti
correlation between hardness ratio and intensity. Within our magnetar theory we
are able to account quantitatively for light curves for both gamma-ray
repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars. In particular we explain the puzzling
light curve after the June 18, 2002 giant burst from AXP 1E 2259+586, so that
we feel this last event as the Rosetta Stone for our theory. Finally, in
Appendix we discuss the origin of the soft emission not only for soft gamma-ray
repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars, but also for isolated X-ray pulsars. We
also offer an explanation for the puzzling spectral features in 1E 1207.4-5209.",2005-04-01T12:46:32Z
"Star Formation and Dust Attenuation Properties in Galaxies from a
  Statistical UV-to-FIR Analysis","We study two galaxy samples selected in ultraviolet (UV) and in far-infrared
(FIR) for which the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the far UV (FUV)
to the FIR are available. We compare the observed SEDs to modelled SEDs with
several star formation histories (SFHs; decaying star formation rate plus
burst) and attenuation laws (power law + 2175 Angstroem bump). The Bayesian
method allows to estimate statistically the best parameters by comparing each
observed SED to the full set of 82800 models. We reach the conclusion that the
UV dust attenuation cannot be estimated correctly from an SED analysis if the
FIR information is not used. The deduced dispersion is larger than with the FIR
data and the distribution is not symetrically distributed about zero: there is
an over-estimation for UV-selected galaxies and an under-estimation for
FIR-selected galaxies. The output from the analysis process suggests that
UV-selected galaxies have attenuation laws in average similar to the LMC
extinction while FIR-selected galaxy attenuation laws more resemble the MW
extinction law. The dispersion about the average relation in the
Log(Fdust/Ffuv) vs. FUV-NUV diagram (once the main relation with FUV-NUV is
accounted for) is explained by two other parameters: the slope of the
attenuation law and the instantaneous birthrate parameter b_0 for UV-selected
galaxies and the same ones plus the strength of the bump for the FIR-selected
galaxies. We propose a recipe to estimate the UV dust attenuation for
UV-galaxies only (that should be used whenever the FIR information is not
available because the resulting Afuv is poorly defined with an uncertainty of
about 0.32): A_{FUV} = 1.4168 (FUV-NUV)^2 + 0.3298 (NUV-I)^2 + 2.1207 (FUV-NUV)
+ 2.7465 (NUV-I) + 5.8408",2005-04-20T08:42:51Z
Two new ZZ Ceti pulsators from the HS and HE surveys,"We report the detection of nonradial g-mode oscillations in the DA white
dwarfs HS1039+4112 (B=15.9) and HE1429-0343 (B=15.8) from time-series
photometry made at the Loiano 1.5 m telescope. The two stars were previously
selected as probable pulsators based on two-color photometry and spectral
analysis respectively. Following our temperature and surface gravity
determinations, HS1039+4112 (Teff=11200 K, logg=8.2) is located near the red
edge of the ZZ Ceti instability strip, whereas HE1429-0343 (Teff=11400 K,
logg=7.8) falls in the middle of the strip. Both stars show a multi-mode
behavior with the main periods at about 850 and 970 s respectively, and
relatively large amplitudes (~7% and ~2.5%).",2005-06-10T08:44:43Z
The near-infrared excitation of the HH211 protostellar outflow,"The protostellar outflow HH211 is of considerable interest since it is
extremely young and highly collimated. Here, we explore the outflow through
imaging and spectroscopy in the near-infrared to determine if there are further
diagnostic signatures of youth. We confirm the detection of a near-infrared
continuum of unknown origin. We propose that it is emitted by the driving
millimeter source, escapes the core through tunnels, and illuminates features
aligning the outflow. Narrow-band flux measurements of these features contain
an unusually large amount of continuum emission. [Fe II] emission has been
detected and is restricted to isolated condensations. However, the
characteristics of vibrational excitation of molecular hydrogen resemble those
of older molecular outflows. We attempt to model the ordered structure of the
western outflow as a series of shocks, finding that bow shocks with J-type
dissociative apices and C-type flanks are consistent. Moreover, essentially the
same conditions are predicted for all three bows except for a systematic
reduction in speed and density with distance from the driving source. We find
increased K-band extinctions in the bright regions as high as 2.9 magnitudes
and suggest that the bow shocks become visible where the outflow impacts on
dense clumps of cloud material. We propose that the outflow is carved out by
episodes of pulsating jets. The jets, driven by central explosive events, are
responsible for excavating a central tunnel through which radiation temporarily
penetrates.",2005-02-04T20:01:45Z
Wide-field weak lensing by RXJ1347-1145,"We present an analysis of weak lensing observations for RXJ1347-1145 over a
43' X 43' field taken in B and R filters on the Blanco 4m telescope at CTIO.
RXJ1347-1145 is a massive cluster at redshift z=0.45. Using a population of
galaxies with 20<R<26, we detect a weak lensing signal at the p<0.0005 level,
finding best-fit parameters of \sigma_v=1400^{+130}_{-140} km s^{-1} for a
singular isothermal sphere model and r_{200} = 3.5^{+0.8}_{-0.2} Mpc with c =
15^{+64}_{-10} for a NFW model in an \Omega_m = 0.3, \Omega_\Lambda = 0.7
cosmology. In addition, a mass to light ratio M/L_R =90 \pm 20 M_\odot /
L_{R\odot} was determined. These values are consistent with the previous weak
lensing study of RXJ1347--1145 by Fischer and Tyson, 1997, giving strong
evidence that systemic bias was not introduced by the relatively small field of
view in that study. Our best-fit parameter values are also consistent with
recent X-ray studies by Allen et al, 2002 and Ettori et al, 2001, but are not
consistent with recent optical velocity dispersion measurements by Cohen and
Kneib, 2002.",2005-02-15T02:39:13Z
"Radio Observations of the Hubble Deep Field South Region II: The 1.4 GHz
  Catalogue and Source Counts","This paper is part of a series describing the results from the Australia
Telescope Hubble Deep Field South (ATHDFS) survey obtained with the Australia
Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). This survey consists of observations at 1.4,
2.5, 5.2 and 8.7 GHz, all centred on the Hubble Deep Field South.
  Here we present the first results from the extended observing campaign at 1.4
GHz. A total of 466 sources have been catalogued to a local sensitivity of 5
sigma (11 microJy rms). A source extraction technique is developed which: 1)
successfully excludes spurious sources from the final source catalogues, and 2)
accounts for the non-uniform noise in our image. A source catalogue is
presented and the general properties of the 1.4 GHz image are discussed. We
also present source counts derived from our ATHDFS 1.4 GHz catalogue.
Particular attention is made to ensure the counts are corrected for survey
incompleteness and systematic effects. Our counts are consistent with other
surveys (e.g. ATESP, VIRMOS, and Phoenix Deep Field), and we find, in common
with these surveys, that the HDFN counts are systematically lower.",2005-06-02T07:47:12Z
The effects of feedback on the morphology of galaxy discs,"We have performed hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation in a LCDM
universe. We have followed galaxy formation in a dark matter halo, chosen to
have a relatively quiet recent merger history, using different models for star
formation and feedback. In all cases, we have adopted a multi-phase description
of the interstellar medium and modelled star formation in quiescent and burst
modes. We have explored two triggers for starbursts: strong shocks and high gas
density, allowing for the possibility that stars in the burst may form with a
top-heavy initial mass function. We find that the final morphology of the
galaxy is extremely sensitive to the modelling of star formation and feedback.
Starting from identical initial conditions, galaxies spanning the wide range of
Hubble types, with B-band disc-to-total luminosity ratios ranging from 0.25 to
0.9, can form in the same dark matter halo. Models in which starbursts are
induced by high gas density (qualitatively similar to models in which feedback
is produced by AGN) generate energetic winds and result in galaxies with an
early-type morphology. Models in which the starbursts are induced by strong
shocks lead to extended discs. In this case, the feedback associated with the
bursts suppresses the collapse of baryons in small halos, helping to create a
reservoir of hot gas that is available for cooling after $z = 1$, following the
bulk of the dynamical activity that builds up the halo. This gas then cools to
form a large, young stellar disc.",2005-03-30T21:11:32Z
Direct detection of the inflationary gravitational wave background,"Inflation generically predicts a stochastic background of gravitational waves
over a broad range of frequencies, from those accessible with cosmic microwave
background (CMB) measurements, to those accessible directly with
gravitational-wave detectors, like NASA's Big-Bang Observer (BBO) or Japan's
Deci-Hertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observer (DECIGO), both currently
under study. Here we investigate the detectability of the inflationary
gravitational-wave background at BBO/DECIGO frequencies. To do so, we survey a
range of slow-roll inflationary models consistent with constraints from the CMB
and large-scale structure (LSS). We go beyond the usual assumption of power-law
power spectra, which may break down given the 16 orders of magnitude in
frequency between the CMB and direct detection, and solve instead the
inflationary dynamics for four classes of inflaton potentials. Direct detection
is possible in a variety of inflationary models, although probably not in any
in which the gravitational-wave signal does not appear in the CMB polarization.
However, direct detection by BBO/DECIGO can help discriminate between
inflationary models that have the same slow-roll parameters at CMB/LSS scales.",2005-06-17T20:00:06Z
Type 2 counterparts of narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies,"Unified models of Seyfert galaxies, based on viewing angles, successfully
explain the observed differences between type 1 and 2 Seyferts. The existence
of a range in accretion rates relative to the Eddington rate (from broad-line
Seyfert 1s to narrow-line Seyfert 1s or NLS1s) and the unification of Seyfert
galaxies imply that there must be type 2 counterparts of NLS1 galaxies i.e.,
Seyfert 2s with high accretion rate or small black hole mass. One such Seyfert
2, NGC5506, has already been unmasked based on near infra-red spectroscopy.
Here we confirm the above result, and present evidence for two additional type
2 counterparts of NLS1s based on XMM-Newton observations. The three AGNs
NGC7314, NGC7582 and NGC5506, with a type 1.9/2 optical spectrum, show
extremely rapid variability by factors >2.4, 1.3, and 1.7 in 200s, 350s and
300s, respectively, and steep 2-12 keV spectrum in their intrinsic X-ray
emission, characteristic of NLS1 galaxies. These observations establish the
obscured NLS1 galaxies as a subclass of Seyfert 2 galaxies.",2005-04-12T20:00:26Z
A Direct Method for Measuring Heat Conductivity in Intracluster Medium,"The inverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
radiation with electrons in the intracluster medium which has a temperature
gradient, was examined by the third-order perturbation theory of the Compton
scattering. A new type of the spectrum distortion of the CMB was found and
named as gradient T Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (gradT SZE). The spectrum has an
universal shape. The spectrum crosses over zero at 326GHz. The sign of the
spectrum depends on the relative direction of the line-of-sight to the
direction of the temperature gradient. This unique spectrum shape can be used
to detect the gradT SZE signal by broad-band or multi-frequency observations of
the SZE. The amplitude of the spectrum distortion does not depend on the
electron density and is proportional to the heat conductivity. Therefore, the
gradT SZE provides an unique opportunity to measure thermally nonequilibrium
electron momentum distribution function when the ICM has a temperature gradient
and the heat conductivity in the ICM. However, the expected amplitude of the
signal is very small. The modifications to the thermal SZE spectrum due to
variety of known effects, such as relativistic correction etc., can become
problematic when using multi-frequency separation techniques to detect the
gradT SZE signal.",2005-02-09T18:48:33Z
"Early chemical enrichment of the universe and the role of very massive
  pop III stars","In this paper the role of very massive pop III stars in the chemical
enrichment of the early universe is discussed. We first compare our predictions
with the abundance ratios measured in the high redshift Lyman-alpha forest to
check whether they are compatible with the values predicted by assuming that
the early universe was enriched by massive pop III stars. We conclude that to
explain the observed C/Si ratio in the intergalactic medium, a contribution
from pop II stars to carbon enrichment is necessary, already at redshift z=5.
We then evaluate the number of Pair-Instability Supernovae (SN_(gamma gamma))
required to enrich the universe to the critical metallicity Z_cr, i.e. the
metallicity value which causes the transition from a very massive star regime
(m > 100 M_sun) to a lower mass regime, similar to the one characteristic of
the present time (m < 100 M_sun). It is found that between 110 and 115
SN_(gamma gamma) are sufficient to chemically enrich a cubic megaparsec of the
intergalactic medium at high redshift for a variety of initial mass functions.
The number of ionizing photons provided by these SN_(gamma gamma) and also by
the pop III stars ending as black holes was computed and we conclude that there
are not enough photons to reionize the universe, being down by at least a
factor of ~ 3. Finally, we calculate the abundance ratios generated by pop III
stars and compare it with the ones observed in low metallicity Damped
Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs). We suggest that pop III stars alone cannot be
responsible for the abundance ratios in these objects and that intermediate
mass pop II stars must have played an important role especially in enriching
DLAs in nitrogen.",2005-02-23T18:28:45Z
Formation of Carbon Dwarfs,"We consider the formation of dwarf carbon stars via accretion from a carbon
AGB companion in light of the new 107 object sample of Downes et al. (2004).
This sample is now large enough to allow good mass determination via comparison
of a composite spectrum to theoretical atmospheric models. Carbon dwarfs of
spectral type M are indeed main sequence M dwarfs with enhanced metallicity and
carbon abundance. We also calculate the predicted abundance of both M and of
F/G carbon dwarfs, and show that the latter should be falsifiable in the near
future.",2005-02-08T20:56:52Z
Distant red galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field,"We take advantage of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF) data to study the
restframe optical and ultra violet (UV) morphologies of the novel population of
Distant Red Galaxies (DRGs). Six galaxies with J-Ks > 2.3 are found to Ks=21.5,
five of which have photometric redshifts z_phot > 2, corresponding to a surface
density of 0.9/arcmin^2. The surface brightness distributions of the z_phot > 2
galaxies are better represented by exponential disks than R^{1/4}-laws. Two of
the z_phot > 2 galaxies are extended, while three have compact morphologies.
The restframe optical morphology of the z_phot > 2 galaxies is quite different
from the restframe UV morphology: all the galaxies have red central components
which dominate in the NICMOS H_{160}-band images, and distinct off-center blue
features which show up in (and often dominate) the ACS images. The mean
measured effective radius of the z_phot > 2 galaxies is <r_e> =1.9+/-1.4 kpc,
similar (within the errors) to the mean size of LBGs at similar redshifts. All
the DRGs are resolved in the ACS images, while four are resolved in the NICMOS
images. Two of the z_phot > 2 galaxies are bright X-ray sources and hence host
AGN. The diverse restframe optical and UV morphological properties of DRGs
derived here suggest that they have complex stellar populations, consisting of
both evolved populations that dominate the mass and the restframe optical
light, and younger populations, which show up as patches of star formation in
the restframe UV light; in many ways resembling the properties of normal local
galaxies. This interpretation is supported by fits to the broadband SEDs, which
for all five z_phot > 2 are best represented by models with extended star
formation histories and substantial amounts of dust.",2005-03-21T21:08:23Z
"Full-Polarization Observations of OH Masers in Massive Star-Forming
  Regions: I. Data","We present full-polarization VLBA maps of the ground-state, main-line, 2 Pi
3/2, J = 3/2 OH masers in 18 Galactic massive star-forming regions. This is the
first large polarization survey of interstellar hydroxyl masers at VLBI
resolution. A total of 184 Zeeman pairs are identified, and the corresponding
magnetic field strengths are indicated. We also present spectra of the NH3
emission or absorption in these star-forming regions. Analysis of these data
will be presented in a companion paper.",2005-05-09T16:13:12Z
Open issues in gamma-ray bursts: polarimetry and dark GRBs,"We review some open problems in the physics of afterglows, namely their
polarization properties and the existence of dark/faint bursts. Polarization
studies yield precious insights in the physical structure and dynamical
evolution of GRB jets, revealing their magnetization properties and their
energy profile. Polarimetric observations of GRB 020813 already allowed to
exclude a homogeneous jet for this event. We then present observations of
faint/dark bursts, showing that some of them may be obscured by dust, while
others are possibly just intrinsically dim.",2005-05-13T18:17:57Z
Understanding our Origins: Star Formation in H II Region Environments,"Recent analysis of the decay products of short-lived radiounclides (SLRs) in
meteorites, in particular the confirmation of the presence of live 60Fe in the
early Solar System, provides unambiguous evidence that the Sun and Solar System
formed near a massive star. We consider the question of the formation of
low-mass stars in environments near massive stars, presenting a scenario for
the evolution of a star and its disk around the periphery of an expanding H II
region. The stages in this scenario begin with compression of molecular gas
around the edge of an H II region, continue as forming stars are overrun by the
advancing ionization front, and culminate when ejecta from one or more nearby
supernova explosions sweeps over YSO disks located in the low density interior
of the H II region, injecting SLRs including 26Al and 60Fe. We review the
evidence that this mode of star formation is more characteristic of formation
of low-mass stars than is the mode of star formation seen in regions such as
the Taurus-Auriga molecular cloud. We discuss the implications of this scenario
for our understanding of star formation, as well as the effects of the young
Sun's astrophysical environment on the formation and evolution of the Solar
System. We conclude that low-mass stars and their accompanying disks form and
evolve very differently near massive stars than they do in regions like
Taurus-Auriga, and that these differences have profound implications for our
understanding of our origins.",2005-06-09T00:27:34Z
"Extinction law variations and dust excitation in the spiral galaxy NGC
  300","We investigate the origin of the strong radial gradient in the
ultraviolet-to-infrared ratio in the spiral galaxy NGC 300, and emphasize the
importance of local variations in the interstellar medium geometry, concluding
that they cannot be neglected with respect to metallicity effects. This
analysis is based upon a combination of maps from GALEX and Spitzer, and from
the ground (UBVRI, Halpha and Hbeta). We select ionizing stellar clusters
associated with HII regions of widely varying morphologies, and derive their
fundamental parameters from population synthesis fitting of their spectral
energy distributions, measured to eliminate local backgrounds accurately. From
these fits, we conclude that the stellar extinction law is highly variable in
the line of sight of young clusters of similar ages. In the particular model
geometry that we consider most appropriate to the sampled regions, we checked
that our findings are not significantly altered by the correct treatment of
radiative transfer effects. The variations are systematic in nature: extinction
laws of the Milky Way or LMC type are associated with compact HII regions (the
compacity being quantified in two different ways), while clusters surrounded by
diffuse HII regions follow extinction laws of the 30 Doradus or SMC type. The
Calzetti starburst attenuation law, although most often degenerate with the 30
Doradus extinction law, overpredicts ionizing photon fluxes by large amounts.
We also find that the extinction law variations are correlated with the column
density of dust species emitting in the near- and mid-infrared. Finally, we
briefly discuss the nebular to stellar extinction ratios, and the excitation of
aromatic band carriers, invalidating their claimed association with cold dust.",2005-06-15T03:30:23Z
Scalar Dark Matter and Cold Stars,"In a medium composed of scalar particles with non-zero mass, the range of
Van-der-Waals-type scalar mediated interactions among nucleons becomes infinite
when the medium makes a transition to a Bose-Einstein condensed phase. We
explore this phenomenon in an astrophysical context. Namely, we study the
effect of a scalar dark matter background on the equilibrium of degenerate
stars.In particular we focus on white dwarfs and the changes induced in their
masses and in their radii.",2005-05-30T14:49:41Z
"A non-LTE analysis of the spectra of two narrow lined main sequence
  stars in the SMC","An analysis of high-resolution VLT/UVES spectra of two B-type main sequence
stars, NGC 346-11 and AV 304, in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), has been
undertaken, using the non-LTE TLUSTY model atmospheres to derive the stellar
parameters and chemical compositions of each star. The chemical compositions of
the two stars are in reasonable agreement. Moreover, our stellar analysis
agrees well with earlier analyses of H II regions. The results derived here
should be representative of the current base-line chemical composition of the
SMC interstellar medium as derived from B-type stars.",2005-03-30T15:08:21Z
Centrally condensed turbulent cores: Massive stars or fragmentation?,"We present numerical investigations into the formation of massive stars from
centrally condensed turbulent cores. The results of five hydrodynamical
simulations are described, following the collapse of the core, fragmentation
and the formation of small clusters of protostars. We generate two different
initial turbulent velocity fields corresponding to power-law spectra with power
varying as k^{-4} and k^{-3.5}, and apply two different initial core radii.
Calculations are included for both completely isothermal collapse, and a
non-isothermal equation of state above a critical density 10^{-14}gcm^{-3}. Our
calculations reveal the preference of fragmentation over monolithic star
formation in turbulent cores. Fragmentation was prevalent in all the isothermal
cases. Although disc fragmentation was largely suppressed in the non-isothermal
runs due to the small dynamic range between the initial density and the
critical density, our results show that some fragmentation still persisted.
This is inconsistent with previous suggestions that turbulent cores result in
the formation of a single massive star. We conclude that turbulence cannot be
measured as an isotropic pressure term.",2005-02-23T12:46:00Z
"Galaxies, Intergalactic Absorption Lines, and Feedback at High Redshift","The galaxy-IGM part of the Lyman-break survey currently consists of measured
redshifts for more than 1000 galaxies with redshift 1.5<z<3.5 along the
sightlines to 25 background QSOs. One of the goals of the survey was to measure
the influence on the intergalactic medium of energetic feedback from star and
black-hole formation. This talk begins with a description of the observed
correlations between galaxies and intergalactic absorption lines and ends with
a discussion of whether any of the observations provide clear evidence for
Mpc-scale superwinds. Although our own observations remain fairly ambiguous,
other observations disfavor a very high redshift (z~10) for the creation of
intergalactic metals.",2005-04-14T00:04:50Z
The outermost cluster of M31,"We report on the identification of a new cluster in the far halo of the M31
galaxy. The cluster, named Bologna 514 (B514) has an integrated magnitude
M_V=-8.5 +- 0.6, and a radial velocity, as estimated from two independent
low-resolution spectra, V_r=-456 +- 23 km/s, which fully confirms its
membership to the M31 system. The observed integrated spectrum is very similar
to those of classical globular clusters. Being located at ~ 4^o (~55 kpc in
projected distance) from the center of the parent galaxy, B514 is by far the
most remote M31 cluster ever discovered. Its projected position, near the
galaxy major axis, and M31-centric velocity, similar to that observed in the
outermost regions of the HI rotation curve, may indicate that it belongs to the
subsystem of M31 clusters that has been recently proposed (Morrison et al.
2004) to be part of the dynamically-cold thin disc of the galaxy.",2005-03-09T09:33:16Z
"Constraints on dark energy from the observed density fluctuations
  spectrum and supernova data","One of the greatest challenges in cosmology today is to determine the nature
of dark energy, the source of the observed present acceleration of the
universe. High precision experiments are being developed to reduce the
uncertainties in the observations. Recently, we showed that the agreement to an
accuracy of 10% of measurements of the present density fluctuations
(\delta\rho/\rho)^2, derived from galaxy distribution (GD) data and cosmic
microwave background (CMB) anisotropies in the \LambdaCDM model, puts very
strong limits on the possible decay of the vacuum energy into cold dark matter.
Using this agreement, combined with the evidence that the matter density
\Omega_M^0=0.28\pm 0.02 and that the universe is approximately flat, we show
that the vacuum metamorphosis model (VMM) and the popular brane-world model
(BWM), both used to explain dark energy, can be discarded. When we relax the
\Omega_M^0 requirement, we find that an agreement within 10% can be obtained
only with \Omega_M^0\simeq 0.36 for the VMM and \Omega_M^0\simeq 0.73 for the
BWM, both of which are not consistent with observations. The agreement of the
CMB and GD data and previous constraints from SNIa data exclude, or put strong
limits on, other dark energy models, which have been suggested, that can be
described by the parametrized equation of state (EOS) w=p/\rho= w_0 + w_a(1-a),
where w_0 and w_a are constants, a is the cosmological scale factor and p
(\rho) is the pressure (energy density) of the dark energy. We find that the
supergravity (SUGRA) model with w_0=-0.82 and w_a=0.58 can be discarded. In
general, we find best values -1.86<w_0<-1.72 with 1.53<w_a<2.0. For redshifts
z\sim 0.5-1, where the supernova data is sensitive, w\sim -1 for this
parametrized EOS.",2005-05-23T15:22:43Z
"Multi-wavelength diffraction-limited imaging of the evolved carbon star
  IRC +10216, II","High angular resolution images of IRC +10216 taken at various bandpasses
within the near-infrared h, k & l bands are presented. The maps have the
highest angular resolution yet recovered, and were reconstructed from
interferometric measurements obtained at the Keck 1 telescope in 1997 December
and 1998 April, forming a subset of a 7-epoch monitoring program presented
earlier [paper 1]. Systematic changes with observing wavelength are found and
discussed in context of present geometrical models for the circumstellar
envelope. With these new high-resolution, multi-wavelength data and
contemporaneous photometry, we also re-visit the hypothesis that the bright
compact Core of the nebula (component `A') marks the location of the central
carbon star. We find that directly measured properties of the Core (angular
size, flux density, color temperature) are consistent with a reddened carbon
star photosphere (line-of-sight tau=5.3).",2005-03-09T01:49:29Z
GZK cutoff distortion due to the energy error distribution shape,"The observed energy spectrum of ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) is
distorted by errors in the energy reconstruction. Here we show that if the
shape of the error distribution is lognormal, the high end of the cosmic ray
spectrum will be distorted. This is distinct and potentially more significant
than the effect of the magnitude of the error in the energy. We estimate the
UHECR spectrum at the Earth assuming it is originated from a cosmological flux.
We then convolute this flux assuming a lognormal error in the energy. We show
that if the standard deviation of the lognormal error distribution is equal or
larger than 0.25, both the shape and the normalization of the measured energy
spectra will be modified significantly. As a consequence the GZK cutoff might
be sufficiently smeared and as not to be seen. This result is independent of
the power law of the cosmological flux. As a conclusion we show that in order
to establish the presence or not of the GZK feature, not only more data is
needed but also that the shape of the energy error distribution has to be known
well.",2005-04-04T22:22:28Z
"Simulation of a population of isolated neutron stars evolving through
  the emission of gravitational waves","We study, via a Monte Carlo simulation, a population of isolated asymmetric
neutron stars where the magnitude of the magnetic field is low enough so that
the dynamical evolution is dominated by the emission of gravitational waves. A
starting population, with age uniformly distributed back to 100 Myr (or 500
Myr) and endowed with a birth kick velocity, is evolved in the Galactic
gravitational potential to the present time. In describing the initial spatial
distribution, the Gould Belt, with an enhanced neutron star formation rate, is
taken into account. Different models for the initial period distribution are
considered. The star ellipticity, measuring the amount of deformation, is drawn
from an exponential distribution. We estimate the detectability of the emitted
gravitational signals by the first and planned second generation of
interferometric detectors. Results are parametrized by the fraction of the
whole galactic neutron star population made of this kind of sources. Some
possible mechanisms, which would make possible the existence of such a
population, are discussed. A comparison of the gravitational spin-down with the
braking due to a possible interaction of the neutron star with the interstellar
medium is also presented.",2005-03-02T16:05:38Z
Evidence for TeV Gamma-Ray Emission from the Galactic Plane,"Gamma-ray emission from a narrow band at the Galactic equator has previously
been detected up to 30 GeV. We report evidence for a TeV gamma-ray signal from
the Galactic plane by Milagro, a large field of view water Cherenkov detector
for extensive air showers. An excess with a significance of 4.5 standard
deviations has been observed from the region of Galactic longitude between 40
and 100 deg and latitude |b| < 5 deg. Under the assumption of a simple power
law spectrum, with no cutoff, in the EGRET-Milagro energy range, the measured
integral flux is phi(>3.5TeV) = (6.4 +/- 1.4 +/- 2.1) 10^{-11} cm^{-2}s^{-1}
str^{-1}. This flux is consistent with an extrapolation of the EGRET spectrum
between 1 and 30 GeV in this Galactic region.",2005-02-15T22:16:38Z
"Variation of the line profile moments for stars pulsating in distorted
  oblique non-radial modes","We derive expressions and develop a numerical technique for the analysis of
the line profile moment variations for stars pulsating in oblique non-radial
modes. This represents an extension of the widely used spectroscopic moment
mode identification method to the oblique distorted pulsations observed in
rapidly oscillating Ap stars. We demonstrate that a non-axisymmetric
superposition of the pulsation and rotation velocity fields results in a
qualitatively new behaviour of some of the line profile characteristics. It is
found that for the majority of roAp stars the second moment varies with the
pulsation frequency rather than with its first harmonic even for axisymmetric
modes. We also identify pulsation observables which do not change during
pulsation cycle but are modulated by the stellar rotation and can contribute to
the variability of the stellar spectra averaged over many pulsation cycles. As
an illustration of the new version of the moment technique, we compute
rotational modulation of the pulsational changes of the line profile moments
for the oblique axisymmetric dipolar pulsation modes with different parameters.
It is also shown that a distortion of the oblique dipolar modes predicted by
the recent theoretical studies of the stellar magneto-acoustic oscillations can
be readily diagnosed through the moment analysis. In particular, the shape of
the pulsation phase modulation for the radial velocity and the second moment is
very sensitive to non-axisymmetric pulsation components, whereas the rotational
modulation of the second moment amplitude is best suited to reveal axisymmetric
magnetically induced distortion of pulsations.",2005-03-21T11:16:54Z
"Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics In Dynamical Spacetimes: Numerical
  Methods And Tests","Many problems at the forefront of theoretical astrophysics require the
treatment of magnetized fluids in dynamical, strongly curved spacetimes. Such
problems include the origin of gamma-ray bursts, magnetic braking of
differential rotation in nascent neutron stars arising from stellar core
collapse or binary neutron star merger, the formation of jets and magnetized
disks around newborn black holes, etc. To model these phenomena, all of which
involve both general relativity (GR) and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), we have
developed a GRMHD code capable of evolving MHD fluids in dynamical spacetimes.
Our code solves the Einstein-Maxwell-MHD system of coupled equations in
axisymmetry and in full 3+1 dimensions. We evolve the metric by integrating the
BSSN equations, and use a conservative, shock-capturing scheme to evolve the
MHD equations. Our code gives accurate results in standard MHD code-test
problems, including magnetized shocks and magnetized Bondi flow. To test our
code's ability to evolve the MHD equations in a dynamical spacetime, we study
the perturbations of a homogeneous, magnetized fluid excited by a gravitational
plane wave, and we find good agreement between the analytic and numerical
solutions.",2005-03-18T21:13:00Z
"Fluorescent Molecular Hydrogen Emission in IC 63: FUSE, HUT, and Rocket
  Observations","We present far-ultraviolet observations of IC 63, an emission/reflection
nebula illuminated by the B0.5IV star gamma Cassiopeia, located 1.3 pc from the
nebula. Molecular hydrogen fluorescence was detected first in IC 63 by IUE and
later at shorter wavelengths by ORFEUS. Here we present Far Ultraviolet
Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) observations towards three locations in the
nebula, complemented by Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope (HUT) data on the central
nebular position. In addition, we present a sounding rocket calibration of a
FUSE spectrum of gamma Cas. Molecular hydrogen fluorescence is detected in all
three FUSE pointings. The intensity of this emission as well as the
contributions from other species are seen to vary with position. The absolute
flux calibration of the sounding rocket data allows us to reliably predict the
radiation field incident on IC 63. We use these data to test models of the
fluorescent process. Our modeling resolves the perceived discrepancy between
the existing ultraviolet observations and achieves a satisfactory agreement
with the H_2 rotational structure observed with FUSE.",2005-04-06T22:46:20Z
"Very compact radio emission from high-mass protostars. II. Dust disks
  and ionized accretion flows","This paper reports 43 GHz imaging of the high-mass protostars W33A, AFGL 2591
and NGC 7538 IRS9 at 0.04'' and 0.6'' resolution. In each case, weak (~mJy),
compact (~100 AU) emission is detected, which has an elongated shape (axis
ratio ~3). For AFGL 2591 and NGC 7538 IRS9, the emission is single-peaked,
while for the highest luminosity source, W33A, a `mini-cluster' of three
sources is detected. The derived sizes, flux densities, and broad-band radio
spectra of the sources support recent models where the initial expansion of HII
regions around very young O-type stars is prevented by stellar gravity. In
these models, accretion flows onto high-mass stars originate in large-scale
molecular envelopes and become ionized close to the star. These models
reproduce our observations of ionized gas as well as the structure of the
molecular envelopes of these sources on 10^3--10^4 AU scales derived previously
from single-dish submillimeter continuum and line mapping. For AFGL 2591, the
43 GHz flux density is also consistent with dust emission from a disk seen in
near-infrared `speckle' images. However, the alignment of the 43 GHz emission
with the large-scale molecular outflow argues against an origin in a disk for
AFGL 2591 and NGC 7538 IRS9. In contrast, the outflow from W33A does not appear
to be collimated. Together with previously presented case studies of W3 IRS5
and AFGL 2136, our results indicate that the formation of stars and stellar
clusters with luminosities up to ~10^5 L0 proceeds through accretion and
produces collimated outflows as in the solar-type case, with the `additional
feature' that the accretion flow becomes ionized close to the star. Above ~10^5
L0, clusters of HII regions appear, and outflows are no longer collimated,
possibly as the result of mergers of protostars or pre-stellar cores.",2005-04-01T14:53:31Z
Why Are Radio-Galaxies Prolific Producers of Type Ia Supernovae?,"An analysis of SNIa events in early type galaxies from the Cappellaro et al
(1999) database provides conclusive evidence that the rate of type Ia
Supernovae (SNe) in radio-loud galaxies is about 4 times higher than the rate
measured in radio-quiet galaxies, i.e. SNIa-rate$(radio-loud galaxies) =
0.43^{+0.19}_{-0.14}h^2_{75}$ SNu as compared to SNIa-rate$(radio-quiet
galaxies) = 0.11^{+0.06}_{-0.03}h^2_{75}$ SNu. The actual value of the
enhancement is likely to be in the range $\sim 2-7$ (P$\sim 10^{-4}$). This
finding puts on robust empirical grounds the results obtained by Della Valle &
Panagia (2003) on the basis of a smaller sample of SNe. We analyse the possible
causes of this result and conclude that the enhancement of SNIa explosion rate
in radio-loud galaxies has the same origin as their being strong radio sources,
but there is no causality link between the two phenomena. We argue that
repeated episodes of interaction and/or mergers of early type galaxies with
dwarf companions, on times-scale of about 1 Gyr, are responsible for inducing
both strong radio activity observed in $\sim$14% of early type galaxies and to
supply an adequate number of SNIa progenitors to the stellar population of
ellipticals.",2005-04-04T21:45:31Z
"alpha-Enhanced Integrated Lick/IDS Spectral Indices and Milky Way and
  M31 Globular Clusters and Early-type Galaxies","All 25 Lick/IDS spectral indices have been computed for the integrated light
of simple stellar populations over broad ranges of age and metallicity and with
effects from horizontal-branch stars fully implemented. For Balmer indices a
significant response was noted for Hgamma and Hdelta when a-elements are
enhanced, but Hbeta is rather a-insensitive. We also find that our 5 Gyr and 12
Gyr models of Hgamma and Hdelta overlap in the metal-poor regime because of
changing populations of blue horizontal-branch stars. Furthermore, for
populations younger than 1 Gyr, Balmer lines become weaker in the metal-poor
regime because the main-sequence turnoff is hotter than 10,000 K. We present
models at fixed [Fe/H] (rather than fixed heavy element mass fraction Z), and
compare to Milky Way globular clusters that have independently estimated mean
[Fe/H] and [a/Fe]. Comparison of our models with observations of Milky Way and
M31 globular clusters in index-index space are favorable, tracing the
observations at a model age of 12 Gyr without any zero-point shifts that are
needed by some other models. Contrary to the literature values, the Milky Way
globular cluster NGC 6553 appears more metal-rich than NGC 6528 from metal
indices. We present Hdelta and Hgamma Lick/IDS indices for the Lick/IDS sample
of galaxies. We confirm the well-known enhancement of Mg and Na relative to Fe
and Ca among early-type galaxies, and its increase with increasing velocity
dispersion. There are distinct differences between globular clusters and
galaxies in diagrams involving CN1 and CN2, hinting that the globular cluster
environment may be a special one in terms of the amount of N incorporated into
stars. (abridged)",2005-04-22T19:58:33Z
Gamma-Ray Burst Jet Profiles And Their Signatures,"HETE-II and BeppoSAX have produced a sample of GRBs and XRFs with known
redshifts and $E_{pk}$. This sample provides four important empirical
constraints on the nature of the source jets: Log $E_{iso}$ is approximately
uniformly distributed over several orders of magnitude; the inferred prompt
energy Log $E_{\gamma}$ is narrowly distributed; the Amati relation holds
between $E_{iso}$ and $E_{pk}$; and the Ghirlanda relation holds between
$E_{\gamma}$ and $E_{pk}$.
  We explore the implications of these constraints for GRB jet structure during
the prompt emission phase. We infer the underlying angular profiles from the
first two of the above constraints assuming all jets have the same profile and
total energy, and show that such ``universal jet'' models cannot satisfy both
constraints.
  We introduce a general and efficient method for calculating relativistic
emission distributions and $E_{pk}$ distributions from jets with arbitrary
(smooth) angular jet profiles. We also exhibit explicit analytical formulas for
emission from top-hat jets (which are not smooth). We use these methods to
exhibit $E_{pk}$ and $E_{iso}$ as a function of viewing angle, for several
interesting families of GRB jet profiles. We use the same methods to calculate
expected frequency distributions of $E_{iso}$ and $E_{\gamma}$ for the same
families of models.
  We then proceed to explore the behavior of universal jet models under a range
of profile shapes and parameters, to map the extent to which these models can
conform to the above four empirical constraints.",2005-05-31T14:48:53Z
Observation of the giant radio galaxy M87 at TeV energies with H.E.S.S,"The giant radio galaxy M 87 was observed at TeV energies with the Cherenkov
telescopes of the H.E.S.S. collaboration (High Energy Stereoscopic System). The
observations have been performed in the year 2003 during the comissioning phase
and in 2004 with the full four telescope setup. The observations were motivated
by the measurement of the HEGRA collaboration which reported a 4.7 sigma excess
of TeV gamma-rays from the direction of M 87. The results of the H.E.S.S.

M 87 (compared to the HEGRA result) - are presented.",2005-04-18T18:46:36Z
"The accreting white dwarfs in BW Scl, BC UMa and SW UMa","We have observed the short-period dwarf novae BW Scl, BC UMa and SW UMa using
the Hubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph. In all three
systems, the white dwarf is the dominant source of far-ultraviolet flux, even
though in BC UMa and SW UMa an additional continuum component contributes ~10%
and ~20% of the 1400A flux, respectively. Fitting the data with detailed white
dwarf model spectra, we determine the effective temperatures to be 14800+-900K
(BW Scl), 15200+-1000K (BC UMa), and 13900+-900K (SW UMa). The additional
continuum component in BC UMa and SW UMa is equally well described by either a
blackbody or a power law, which could be associated with emission from the hot
spot or from an optically thin accretion disk (or an optically thin layer on
top of a colder optically thick disk), respectively. Modelling the narrow metal
lines detected in the STIS spectra results in sub-solar abundances of carbon,
oxygen and silicon for all three systems, and also suggests substantial
supra-solar abundances of aluminium. The narrow absorption line profiles imply
low white dwarf rotation rates, v sin(i)<=300km/s for the three white dwarfs.
SW UMa is the only system that shows significant short-term variability in the
far-ultraviolet range, which is primarily associated with the observed emission
lines.",2005-04-18T11:10:38Z
Fast directional continuous spherical wavelet transform algorithms,"We describe the construction of a spherical wavelet analysis through the
inverse stereographic projection of the Euclidean planar wavelet framework,
introduced originally by Antoine and Vandergheynst and developed further by
Wiaux et al. Fast algorithms for performing the directional continuous wavelet
analysis on the unit sphere are presented. The fast directional algorithm,
based on the fast spherical convolution algorithm developed by Wandelt and
Gorski, provides a saving of O(sqrt(Npix)) over a direct quadrature
implementation for Npix pixels on the sphere, and allows one to perform a
directional spherical wavelet analysis of a 10^6 pixel map on a personal
computer.",2005-06-14T15:01:53Z
"A Computational Guide to Physics of Eclipsing Binaries. Paper I.
  Demonstrations and Perspectives","PHOEBE (PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs) is a modeling package for eclipsing
binary stars, built on top of the widely used WD program (Wilson & Devinney
1971). This introductory paper overviews most important scientific extensions
(incorporating observational spectra of eclipsing binaries into the
solution-seeking process, extracting individual temperatures from observed
color indices, main-sequence constraining and proper treatment of the
reddening), numerical innovations (suggested improvements to WD's Differential
Corrections method, the new Nelder & Mead's downhill Simplex method) and
technical aspects (back-end scripter structure, graphical user interface).
While PHOEBE retains 100% WD compatibility, its add-ons are a powerful way to
enhance WD by encompassing even more physics and solution reliability. The
operability of all these extensions is demonstrated on a synthetic
main-sequence test binary; applications to real data will be published in
follow-up papers. PHOEBE is released under the GNU General Public License,
which guarranties it to be free, open to anyone interested to join in on future
development.",2005-03-16T18:11:53Z
Gamma-Ray Burst Sequences in Hardness Ratio-Peak Energy Plane,"The narrowness of the distribution of the peak energy of $\nu F_{\nu}$
spectrum of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and the unification of GRB population are
great puzzles yet to be solved. We investigate the two puzzles based on the
global spectral behaviors of different GRB population in the $HR-E_{\rm{p}}$
plane (HR the spectral hardness ratio) with BATSE and HETE-2 observations. It
is found that long GRBs and XRFs observed by HETE-2 seem to follow the same
sequence in the $HR-E_{\rm{p}}$ plane, with the XRFs at the low end of this
sequence. The long and short GRBs observed by BATSE follow significantly
different sequences in the $HR-E_{\rm p}$ plane, with most of the short GRBs
having a larger hardness ratio than the long GRBs at a given $E_{\rm{p}}$.
These results indicate that the global spectral behaviors of the long GRB
sample and the XRF sample are similar, while that of short GRBs is different.
The short GRBs seem to be a unique subclass of GRBs, and they are not the
higher energy extension of the long GRBs (abridged).",2005-04-18T02:38:17Z
"Hard Extended X-ray Source in the IC 443 SNR Resolved by Chandra: A Fast
  Ejecta Fragment or a New Pulsar Wind Nebula?","A Chandra observation of the isolated hard X-ray source XMMU
J061804.3+222732, located in the region of apparent interaction of the
supernova remnant IC 443 with a molecular cloud, resolved the complex structure
of the source in a few bright clumps embedded in an extended emission of a ~ 30
arcsec size. The X-ray spectra of the clumps and the extended emission are
dominated by a hard power-law component with a photon index of 1.2--1.4. In
addition, we see some indications of an optically thin thermal plasma of a ~
0.3 keV temperature. The observed X-ray morphology and spectra are consistent
with those expected for an isolated supernova ejecta fragment interacting with
a dense ambient medium. A possible alternative interpretation is a pulsar wind
nebula associated with either IC 443 or another SNR, G189.6+3.3.",2005-03-31T17:57:57Z
Feedback in simulations of disc-galaxy major mergers,"Using hydrodynamic simulations of disc-galaxy major mergers, we investigate
the star formation history and remnant properties when various parametrizations
of a simple stellar feedback model are implemented. The simulations include
radiative cooling, a density-dependent star formation recipe and a model for
feedback from massive stars. The feedback model stores supernova feedback
energy within individual gas particles and dissipates this energy on a
time-scale specified by two free parameters; tau_fb, which sets the dissipative
time-scale, and n, which sets the effective equation of state in star-forming
regions. Using a self-consistent disc galaxy, modelled after a local Sbc
spiral, in both isolated and major-merger simulations, we investigate
parametrizations of the feedback model that are selected with respect to the
quiescent disc stability. These models produce a range of star formation
histories that are consistent with the star formation relation found by
Kennicutt. All major mergers produce a population of new stars that is highly
centrally concentrated, demonstrating a distinct break in the r1/4 surface
density profile, consistent with previous findings. The half-mass radius and
one-dimensional velocity dispersion are affected by the feedback model used.
Finally, we compare our results to those of previous simulations of star
formation in disc-galaxy major mergers, addressing the effects of star
formation normalization, the version of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
employed and assumptions about the interstellar medium.",2005-03-09T19:37:23Z
Radiation Pressure Supported Starburst Disks and AGN Fueling,"We consider the structure of marginally Toomre-stable starburst disks under
the assumption that radiation pressure on dust grains provides the dominant
vertical support against gravity. This is particularly appropriate when the
disk is optically thick to its own IR radiation, as in the central regions of
ULIRGs. Because the disk radiates at its Eddington limit, the Schmidt-law for
star formation changes in the optically-thick limit, with the star formation
rate per unit area scaling as Sigma_g/kappa, where Sigma_g is the gas surface
density and kappa is the mean opacity. We show that optically thick starburst
disks have a characteristic flux and dust effective temperature of F ~ 10^{13}
L_sun/kpc^2 and T_eff ~ 90K, respectively. We compare our predictions with
observations and find good agreement. We extend our model from many-hundred
parsec scales to sub-parsec scales and address the problem of fueling AGN. We
assume that angular momentum transport proceeds via global torques rather than
a local viscosity. We account for the radial depletion of gas due to star
formation and find a strong bifurcation between two classes of disk models: (1)
solutions with a starburst on large scales that consumes all of the gas with
little fueling of a central AGN and (2) models with an outer large-scale
starburst accompanied by a more compact starburst on 1-10 pc scales and a
bright central AGN. The luminosity of the latter models is in many cases
dominated by the AGN. We show that the vertical thickness of the starburst disk
on pc scales can approach h ~ r, perhaps accounting for the nuclear obscuration
in some Type 2 AGN. We also argue that the disk of young stars in the Galactic
Center may be the remnant of such a compact nuclear starburst.",2005-03-01T21:20:19Z
Planned Dark Matter searches with the MAGIC Telescope,"The MAGIC 17m-diameter Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) has been
commissioned beginning of 2005. The telescope has been designed to achieve the
lower detection energy threshold ever obtained with an IACT, about 50 GeV. A
new window in gamma-ray astronomy is being opened with great impact for
exciting new physics and new discoveries. Among the targets of MAGIC is the
indirect detection of Dark Matter (DM). We have considered different DM halo
models of high DM density objects like the center of the Milky Way, its closest
satellites and nearby galaxies (M31,M87). For each object, detection limits are
computed for different DM halo models in a mSUGRA scenario for supersymmetric
neutralino annihilation $\gamma$-ray production. Advantages and drawbacks of
these objects and plans for future observations are discussed.",2005-05-15T18:28:22Z
Limits of Adaptive Optics for high contrast imaging,"The effects of photon noise, aliasing, wavefront chromaticity and
scintillation on the point spread function (PSF) contrast achievable with
ground based adaptive optics (AO) are evaluated for different wavefront sensing
schemes. I show that a wavefront sensor (WFS) based upon the Zernike phase
contrast technique offers the best sensitivity to photon noise at all spatial
frequencies, while the Shack-Hartmann WFS is significantly less sensitive. In
AO systems performing wavefront sensing in the visible and scientific imaging
in the near-IR, the PSF contrast limit is set by the scintillation chromaticity
induced by Fresnel propagation through the atmosphere. On a 8m telescope, the
PSF contrast is then limited to 1e-4 to 1e-5 in the central arcsecond.
Wavefront sensing and scientific imaging should therefore be done at the same
wavelength, in which case, on bright sources, PSF contrasts between 1e-6 and
1e-7 can be achieved within 1 arcsecond on a 8m telescope in optical/near-IR.
The impact of atmospheric turbulence parameters (seeing, wind speed, turbulence
profile) on the PSF contrast is quantified. I show that a focal plane wavefront
sensing scheme offers unique advantages, and I discuss how to implement it.
Coronagraphic options are also briefly discussed.",2005-05-05T00:04:24Z
"The dM4.5e star G124-62 and its binary L dwarf companion DENIS-P
  J1441-0945: Common proper motion, distance, age, and masses","We present astrometric and photometric measurements of the field binary L1
dwarf DENIS-P J1441-0945. Analysis of archival HST images and photometric
parallax measurements give a distance of 34+/-7 pc and a proper motion close to
that of the nearby high proper motion star G124-62. Comparison of SuperCOSMOS
and 2MASS images confirms that these objects form a common proper motion pair,
while spectroscopy of G124-62 shows it to be a dM4.5e star. The kinematics show
that this system is a member of the Hyades supercluster. The resulting age
constraints for the system are 500--800 Myr and the mass of each component of
DENIS-P J1441-0945 is 0.072 (+0.010/-0.018) M_sun.",2005-05-17T17:30:18Z
"Rates of Neutrino Absorption on Nucleons and the Reverse Processes in
  Strong Magnetic Fields","The rates of electron neutrino capture on neutron, electron anti-neutrino
capture on proton, and their reverse processes are important for understanding
the production of heavy elements in the supernova environment above the
protoneutron star. Observations and theoretical considerations suggest that
some protoneutron stars may be born with strong magnetic fields. We develop a
numerical method to calculate the above rates in supernova environments with
magnetic fields up to 10^16 G. This method is accurate to the order of one over
nucleon mass. We show that our results have the correct behavior in the limit
of high neutrino energy or small magnetic field. Based on comparison of our
results with various approximations, we recommend efficient estimates of the
above rates for use in models of supernova nucleosynthesis in the presence of
strong magnetic fields.",2005-06-01T20:26:43Z
"Effects of External Tidal Field on the Evolution of Multi-mass Star
  Clusters","We present N-body simulations of realistic globular clusters containing
initial mass function in the galaxy to study effects of tidal field
systematically on the properties of outer parts of globular clusters. Using
NBODY6 which takes into account the two-body relaxation correctly, we
investigate general evolution of globular clusters in galactic tidal field. For
simplicity, we have employed only spherical components (bulge and halo) of the
galaxy. Total number of stars in our simulations was about 20,000. All
simulations were done for several orbital periods in order to understand the
development of the tidal tails. In our scaled down models, the relaxation time
is sufficiently short to show the mass segregation effect, but we did not go
far enough to see the core-collapse, and the fraction of stars lost from the
cluster at the end of simulation is only about 10%. The radial distribution of
extra-tidal stars can be described by a power law with a slope around -3. The
direction of tidal tails are determined by the orbits and locations of the
clusters. We find that the length of tidal tails increases towards the
apogalacticon and decreases towards the perigalacticon. This is an
anti-correlation with the strength of the tidal field, caused by the fact that
the the time-scale for the stars to respond to the potential is similar to the
orbital time-scale of the cluster. When the length of tidal tails decreases
some of the stars in the tidal tails are recaptured by the host cluster. From
the investigation of velocity anisotropy of the model clusters, we find that in
the early stages of globular cluster evolution the clusters have radial
anisotropy in the outermost parts, while clusters are nearly isotropic in the
cental region. The radial anisotropy decreases with time.",2005-03-09T14:30:08Z
Radio Emission Associated with the ULX in Holmberg II,"We report the detection of radio emission coincident with the ultraluminous
X-ray source (ULX) in Holmberg II. The radio emission is diffuse and resolved,
covering an area ~60 by 40 pc in extent and well-matched to the recently
discovered HeII nebula surrounding the X-ray source. Comparison of the radio
and optical properties of this extended radio emission argue against its
association with either an HII region or supernova remnant. This is additional
evidence that this ULX is not powered by a stellar-mass object whose emission
is relativistically beamed towards the observer, and thus is either a
super-Eddington source or intermediate mass black hole as suggested by optical
observations. Implications of this result to future and existing radio studies
of ULXs are discussed.",2005-03-09T14:52:14Z
"Solar Control on Jupiter's Equatorial X-ray Emissions: 26-29 November
  2003 XMM-Newton Observation","During November 26-29, 2003 XMM-Newton observed soft (0.2-2 keV) X-ray
emission from Jupiter for 69 hours. The low-latitude X-ray disk emission of
Jupiter is observed to be almost uniform in intensity with brightness that is
consistent with a solar-photon driven process. The simultaneous lightcurves of
Jovian equatorial X-rays and solar X-rays (measured by the TIMED/SEE and GOES
satellites) show similar day-to-day variability. A large solar X-ray flare
occurring on the Jupiter-facing side of the Sun is found to have a
corresponding feature in the Jovian X-rays. These results support the
hypothesis that X-ray emission from Jovian low-latitudes are solar X-rays
scattered from the planet's upper atmosphere, and suggest that the Sun directly
controls the non-auroral X-rays from Jupiter's disk. Our study also suggests
that Jovian equatorial X-rays can be used to monitor the solar X-ray flare
activity on the hemisphere of the Sun that is invisible to space weather
satellites.",2005-04-29T17:51:49Z
Massive Star Outflows,"Molecular outflows in the form of wide-angle winds and/or well-collimated
jets are associated with young stellar objects of all luminosities. Independent
studies have established that the mass outflow rate is proportional to
L_bol^0.6 for L_bol = 0.3 to 10^5 L_sun, suggesting that there is a strong link
between accretion and outflow for a wide range of source luminosity and there
is reasonable evidence that accretion-related processes are responsible for
generating massive molecular flows from protostars up to spectral type B0.
Beyond L_bol ~ 10^4 L_sun, O stars generate powerful wide-angle, ionized winds
that can dramatically affect outflow morphology and even call into question the
relationship between outflow and accretion.
  Recently Beuther & Shepherd (2005) proposed an evolutionary scenario in which
massive protostellar flows (up to early B spectral type) begin collimated. Once
the star reaches the Main Sequence, ionizing radiation may affect the balance
between magnetic and plasma pressure, inducing changes in the flow morphology
and energetics. Here I review the properties of outflows from young OB stars,
discuss implications and observational tests of this proposed evolutionary
scenario, and examine differences between low-mass and massive star formation.",2005-06-01T18:11:12Z
"A Divided Universe: Red and Blue Galaxies and their Preferred
  Environments","(Summary) Making use of scaling relations between the central and the total
galaxy luminosity of a dark matter halo as a function of the halo mass, and the
scatter in these relations, we present an empirical model to describe the
luminosity function (LF) of galaxies. We extend this model to describe relative
statistics of early-type, or red, and late-type, or blue, galaxies, with the
fraction of early type galaxies at halo centers, relative to the total sample,
determined only by the halo mass and the same fraction in the case of
satellites is taken to be dependent on both the halo mass and the satellite
galaxy luminosity. This simple model describes the conditional luminosity
functions, LF of galaxies as a function of the halo mass, measured with the 2dF
galaxy group catalog from cluster to group mass scales. Using 2dF measurements,
we extract information related to conditional mass function for halos from
extreme voids to dense regions in terms of the galaxy overdensity. We also
calculate the probability distribution function of halo mass, as a function of
the galaxy overdensity, and use these probabilities to address preferred
environments of red and blue galaxies. Our model also allow us to make
predictions, for example, galaxy bias as a function of the galaxy type and
luminosity, the void mass function, and the average galaxy luminosity as a
function of the density environment.",2005-05-20T15:47:10Z
"A Compiled Catalogue of Spectroscopically Determined Elemental
  Abundances for Stars with Accurate Parallaxes. I.Magnesium","We present a compiled catalogue of effective temperatures, surface gravities,
iron and magnesium abundances, distances, velocity components, and orbital
elements for stars in the solar neighborhood. The atmospheric parameters and
iron abundances are averages of published values derived from model synthetic
spectra for a total of about 2000 values in 80 publications. Our relative
magnesium abundances were found from 1412 values in 31 publications for 876
dwarfs and subgiants using a three-step iteration averaging procedure, with
weights assigned to each source of data as well as to each individual
determination and taking into account systematic deviations of each scale
relative to the reduced mean scale. The estimated assumed completeness for data
sources containing more than five stars, up to late December 2003, exceeds 90%.
For the vast majority of stars in the catalogue, the spatial velocity
components were derived from modern high-precision astrometric observations,
and their Galactic orbit elements were computed using a three-component model
of the Galaxy, consisting of a disk, a bulge, and a massive extended halo.",2005-03-28T15:51:59Z
"The evolution of the cluster X-ray scaling relations in the WARPS sample
  at 0.6<z<1.0","The X-ray properties of a sample of 11 high-redshift (0.6<z<1.0) clusters
observed with Chandra and/or XMM are used to investigate the evolution of the
cluster scaling relations. The observed evolution of the L-T and M-L relations
is consistent with simple self-similar predictions, in which the properties of
clusters reflect the properties of the universe at their redshift of
observation. When the systematic effect of assuming isothermality on the
derived masses of the high-redshift clusters is taken into account, the
high-redshift M-T and Mgas-T relations are also consistent with self-similar
evolution. Under the assumption that the model of self-similar evolution is
correct and that the local systems formed via a single spherical collapse, the
high-redshift L-T relation is consistent with the high-z clusters having formed
at a significantly higher redshift than the local systems. The data are also
consistent with the more realistic scenario of clusters forming via the
continuous accretion of material. The slope of the L-T relation at
high-redshift (B=3.29+/-0.38) is consistent with the local relation, and
significantly steeper then the self-similar prediction of B=2. This suggests
that the non-gravitational processes causing the steepening occurred at z>1 or
in the early stages of the clusters' formation, prior to their observation. The
properties of the intra-cluster medium at high-redshift are found to be similar
to those in the local universe. The mean surface-brightness profile slope for
the sample is 0.66+/-0.05, the mean gas mass fractions within R2500 and R200
are 0.073+/-0.010 and 0.12+/-0.02 respectively, and the mean metallicity of the
sample is 0.28+/-0.16 solar.",2005-03-21T21:19:39Z
Alternatives to Dark Matter and Dark Energy,"We review the underpinnings of the standard Newton-Einstein theory of
gravity, and identify where it could possibly go wrong. In particular, we
discuss the logical independence from each other of the general covariance
principle, the equivalence principle and the Einstein equations, and discuss
how to constrain the matter energy-momentum tensor which serves as the source
of gravity. We identify the a priori assumption of the validity of standard
gravity on all distance scales as the root cause of the dark matter and dark
energy problems, and discuss how the freedom currently present in gravitational
theory can enable us to construct candidate alternatives to the standard theory
in which the dark matter and dark energy problems could then be resolved. We
identify three generic aspects of these alternate approaches: that it is a
universal acceleration scale which determines when a luminous Newtonian
expectation is to fail to fit data, that there is a global cosmological effect
on local galactic motions which can replace galactic dark matter, and that to
solve the cosmological constant problem it is not necessary to quench the
cosmological constant itself, but only the amount by which it gravitates.",2005-05-12T19:15:30Z
"On the periodic clustering of cosmic ray exposure ages of iron
  meteorites","Two recent papers claimed to have found a periodic variation of the galactic
cosmic ray (CR) flux over the last 1-2 Gyr, using the CR exposure ages of iron
meteorites. This was attributed to higher CR flux during the passage of the
Earth through the spiral arms of the Milky Way, as suggested by models. The
derived period was 143+-10 Myrs. We perform a more detailed analysis of the CR
exposure ages on the same data set, using extensive simulation to estimate the
influence of different error sources on the significance of the periodicity
signal. We find no evidence for significant clustering of the CR exposure ages
at a 143 Myr period nor for any other period between 100 and 250 Myrs. Rather,
we find the data to be consistent with being drawn from a uniform distribution
of CR exposure ages. The different conclusion of the original studies is due to
their neglecting the influence of (i) data treatment on the statistics, (ii)
several error sources, and (iii) number statistics.",2005-04-06T18:22:18Z
"Modeling the 3--D Secular Planetary Three-Body Problem. Discussion on
  the outer ${\upsilon}$ Andromedae Planetary System","The three-dimensional secular behavior of a system composed of a central star
and two massive planets is modeled semi-analytically in the frame of the
general three-body problem. The main dynamical features of the system are
presented in geometrical pictures allowing us to investigate a large domain of
the phase space of this problem without time-expensive numerical integrations
of the equations of motion and without any restriction on the magnitude of the
planetary eccentricities, inclinations and mutual distance. Several regimes of
motion of the system are observed. With respect to the secular angle
$\Delta\varpi$, possible motions are circulations, oscillations (around 0 and
$180^\circ$), and high eccentricity/inclination librations in secular
resonances. With respect to the arguments of pericenter, $\omega_1$ and
$\omega_2$, possible motions are direct circulation and high-inclination
libration around $\pm 90^\circ$ in the Lidov-Kozai resonance. The regions of
transition between domains of different regimes of motion are characterized by
chaotic behavior.
  We apply the analysis to the case of the two outer planets of the $\upsilon$
Andromedae system, observed edge-on. The topology of the 3--D phase space of
this system is investigated in detail by means of surfaces of section, periodic
orbits and dynamical spectra, mapping techniques and numerical simulations. We
obtain the general structure of the phase space, and the boundaries of the
spatial secular stability. We find that this system is secularly stable in a
large domain of eccentricities and inclinations.",2005-05-09T14:02:00Z
Stellar dynamo driven wind braking instead of disc coupling,"Star-disc coupling is considered in numerical models where the stellar field
is not an imposed perfect dipole, but instead a more irregular self-adjusting
dynamo-generated field. Using axisymmetric simulations of the hydromagnetic
mean-field equations, it is shown that the resulting stellar field
configuration is more complex, but significantly better suited for driving a
stellar wind. In agreement with recent findings by a number of people,
star-disc coupling is less efficient in braking the star than previously
thought. Moreover, stellar wind braking becomes equally important. In contrast
to a perfect stellar dipole field, dynamo-generated stellar fields favor
field-aligned accretion with considerably higher velocity at low latitudes,
where the field is weaker and originating in the disc. Accretion is no longer
nearly periodic (as it is in the case of a stellar dipole), but it is more
irregular and episodic.",2005-04-03T17:55:55Z
"The ACS Virgo Cluster Survey V: SBF Calibration for Giant and Dwarf
  Early-type Galaxies","As part of the Advanced Camera for Survey (ACS) Virgo Cluster Survey, we have
measured Surface Brightness Fluctuations (SBF) in a sample of 100 early-type
Virgo galaxies. Distances derived from these measurements are needed to explore
the three-dimensional structure of the Virgo Cluster, study the intrinsic
parameters of globular clusters associated with the program galaxies, and
compare with the galaxy distances derived from globular cluster luminosity
functions. Our SBF measurements have been performed in the F850LP bandpass of
the Wide Field Channel of the ACS on the Hubble Space Telescope. These are the
first measurements of this kind, and we present the first SBF calibration for
this bandpass. The measured fluctuations depend on galaxy stellar population
variations, which we quantify by galaxy color (g_475-z_850)_0, where g_475 and
z_850 are the galaxy magnitudes, respectively, in the F475W and F850LP ACS
filters. We derive the following calibration for the absolute SBF magnitude
M_850: M_850 = -2.06 +/- 0.04 + (2.0 +/ 0.2) [ (g_475-z_850)_0-1.3 ] in the
range 1.3 <(g_475-z_850)_0 <= 1.6, and M_850 = -2.06 +/- 0.04 + (0.9 +/- 0.2) [
(g_475-z_850)_0-1.3 ] in the range 1.0 <=(g_475-z_850)_0 <= 1.3. Physically,
the two different color regimes correspond to different galaxy types: giant
ellipticals and S0s at the red end, and early-type dwarfs at the blue end. For
the first time in SBF studies, we are able to provide a firm empirical
calibration of SBF in early-type dwarf galaxies. Our results agree with stellar
population model predictions from Bruzual & Charlot (2003).",2005-06-14T16:20:44Z
Three-Mirror Anastigmat Telescope with an Unvignetted Flat Focal Plane,"A new optical design concept of telescopes to provide an aberration-free,
wide field, unvignetted flat focal plane is described. The system employs three
aspheric mirrors to remove aberrations, and provides a semi-circular field of
view with minimum vignetting. The third mirror reimages the intermediate image
made by the first two-mirror system with a magnification factor on the order of
unity. The present system contrasts with the Korsch system where the
magnification factor of the third mirror is usually much larger than unity. Two
separate optical trains can be deployed to cover the entire circular field, if
necessary.",2005-04-23T00:51:17Z
"Implications of Halo Inside-out Growth on the X-Ray Properties of Nearby
  Galaxy Systems within the Preheating Scenario","We present an entirely analytic model for a preheated, polytropic
intergalactic medium in hydrostatic equilibrium within a NFW dark halo
potential in which the evolution of the halo structure between major merger
events proceeds inside-out by accretion. This model is used to explain, within
a standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmogony, the observed X-ray properties of nearby
relaxed, non-cooling flow groups and clusters of galaxies. We find that our
preferred solution to the equilibrium equations produces scaling relations in
excellent agreement with observations, while simultaneously accounting for the
typical structural characteristics of the distribution of the diffuse baryons.
In the class of preheating models, ours stands out because it offers a unified
description of the intrahalo medium for galaxy systems with total masses above
$\sm 2\times 10^{13}$\msun, does not produce baryonic configurations with large
isentropic cores, and reproduces faithfully the observed behavior of the gas
entropy at large radii. All this is achieved with a moderate level of energy
injection of about half a keV, which can be easily accommodated within the
limits of the total energy released by the most commonly invoked feedback
mechanisms, as well as with a polytropic index of 1.2, consistent with both
many observational determinations and predictions from high-resolution
gas-dynamical simulations of non-cooling flow clusters. More interestingly, our
scheme offers a physical motivation for the adoption of this specific value of
the polytropic index, as it is the one that best ensures the conservation after
halo virialization of the balance between the total specific energies of the
gas and dark matter components for the full range of masses investigated.",2005-04-13T17:55:23Z
"Systematic Errors in Future Weak Lensing Surveys: Requirements and
  Prospects for Self-Calibration","We study the impact of systematic errors on planned weak lensing surveys and
compute the requirements on their contributions so that they are not a dominant
source of the cosmological parameter error budget. The generic types of error
we consider are multiplicative and additive errors in measurements of shear, as
well as photometric redshift errors. In general, more powerful surveys have
stronger systematic requirements. For example, for a SNAP-type survey the
multiplicative error in shear needs to be smaller than 1%(fsky/0.025)^{-1/2} of
the mean shear in any given redshift bin, while the centroids of photometric
redshift bins need to be known to better than 0.003(fsky/0.025)^{-1/2}. With
about a factor of two degradation in cosmological parameter errors, future
surveys can enter a self-calibration regime, where the mean systematic biases
are self-consistently determined from the survey and only higher-order moments
of the systematics contribute. Interestingly, once the power spectrum
measurements are combined with the bispectrum, the self-calibration regime in
the variation of the equation of state of dark energy w_a is attained with only
a 20-30% error degradation.",2005-06-02T14:25:00Z
Relativistic Binary Pulsars with Black-Hole Companions,"Binaries containing a stellar-mass black hole and a recycled radio pulsar
have so far eluded detection. We present a focused investigation of the
formation and evolution of these systems in the Galactic disk, highlighting the
factors that limit their numbers and the reasons why they may be extremely
rare. We surmise that the birthrate of black-hole/recycled-pulsar binaries in
the Galactic disk is probably no higher than ~10^{-7}/yr, and may be much less.
Simple arguments regarding common-envelope evolution suggest that these
binaries should have orbital periods less than 10 hr and an average lifetime of
<~10^8 yr before coalescence due to the emission of gravitational radiation. We
expect that fewer than ~10 of these compact, relativistic binaries currently
reside in the Galactic disk, less than 0.1--1% of the number of double neutron
stars. The discovery of two or more black-hole/recycled-pulsar binaries using
current radio telescopes would tightly constrain certain ideas regarding the
evolution of massive stars, dynamical mass transfer, and black-hole formation.",2005-02-05T18:28:51Z
"The chemistry of fluorine-bearing molecules in diffuse and dense
  interstellar gas clouds","We present a theoretical investigation of the chemistry of fluorine-bearing
molecules in diffuse and dense interstellar gas clouds. The chemistry of
interstellar fluorine is qualitatively different from that of any other
element, because - unlike the neutral atoms of any other element found in
diffuse or dense molecular clouds - atomic fluorine undergoes an exothermic
reaction with molecular hydrogen. Over a wide range of conditions attained
within interstellar gas clouds, the product of that reaction - hydrogen
fluoride - is predicted to be the dominant gas-phase reservoir of interstellar
fluorine nuclei. Our model predicts HF column densities ~ 1.E+13 cm-2 in dark
clouds and column densities as large as 1.E-11 cm-2 in diffuse interstellar gas
clouds with total visual extinctions as small as 0.1 mag. Such diffuse clouds
will be detectable by means of absorption line spectroscopy of the J = 1 - 0
transition at 243.2 micron using the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared
Astronomy (SOFIA) and the Herschel Space Observatory (HSO). The CF+ ion is
predicted to be the second most abundant fluorine-bearing molecule, with
typical column densities a factor ~ 100 below those of HF; with its lowest two
rotational transitions in the millimeter-wave spectral region, CF+ may be
detectable from ground-based observatories. HF absorption in quasar spectra is
a potential probe of molecular gas at high redshift, providing a possible
bridge between the UV/optical observations capable of probing H2 in low column
density systems and the radio/millimeter-wavelength observations that probe
intervening molecular clouds of high extinction and large molecular fraction;
at redshifts beyond ~ 0.3, HF is potentially detectable from ground-based
submillimeter observatories in several atmospheric transmission windows.",2005-04-13T19:44:03Z
"Family ties: abundances in Terzan 7, a Sgr dSph globular cluster","We study the chemical composition of 5 giant stars in the globular cluster
Terzan 7 associated with the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph),
based on high resolution UVES-VLT spectra. We confirm the metallicity found by
previous high resolution investigations: [Fe/H] ~ -0.6. We also show that this
cluster displays the same low alpha-element to iron ratio found in Sgr dSph
field stars of similar metallicity, as well as the same low Ni/Fe ratio. These
chemical signatures are characteristic of the Sgr dSph system, and appear to be
shared both by the globular cluster Pal 12, which was most likely stripped from
Sgr by tidal interaction, and by Pal 5, which may also have belonged in the
past to the Sgr dSph system. Intriguingly even globular cluster Ruprecht 106,
although not associated to Sgr, displays similar characteristics.",2005-05-14T10:27:32Z
"Dark Matter Halos: Shapes, The Substructure Crisis, and Indirect
  Detection","In this proceeding, we briefly review three recent results. First, we show
that halos formed in simulations with gas cooling are significantly rounder
than halos formed in dissipationless $N$-body simulations. The increase in
principle axis ratios is $\delta (c/a) ~ 0.2 - 0.4$ in the inner halo and
remains significant at large radii. Second, we discuss the CDM substructure
crisis and demonstrate the sensitivity of the crisis to the spectrum of
primordial density fluctuations on small scales. Third, we assess the ability
of experiments like VERITAS and GLAST to detect $\gamma$-rays from neutralino
dark matter annihilation in dark subhalos about the MW.",2005-02-06T15:24:46Z
"An Efficient Numerical Scheme for Simulating Particle Acceleration in
  Evolving Cosmic-Ray Modified Shocks","We have developed a new, very efficient numerical scheme to solve the CR
diffusion convection equation that can be applied to the study of the nonlinear
time evolution of CR modified shocks for arbitrary spatial diffusion
properties. The efficiency of the scheme derives from its use of coarse-grained
finite momentum volumes. This approach has enabled us, using $\sim 10 - 20$
momentum bins spanning nine orders of magnitude in momentum, to carry out
simulations that agree well with results from simulations of modified shocks
carried out with our conventional finite difference scheme requiring more than
an order of magnitude more momentum points. The coarse-grained, CGMV scheme
reduces execution times by a factor approximately half the ratio of momentum
bins used in the two methods. Depending on the momentum dependence of the
diffusion, additional economies in required spatial and time resolution can be
utilized in the CGMV scheme, as well. These allow a computational speed-up of
at least an order of magnitude in some cases.",2005-06-09T18:55:48Z
"Constraints on Inner Disk Evolution Timescales: A Disk Census of the eta
  Chamaeleontis Young Cluster","We present new L' (3.8-micron) observations of stars in the nearby (~97 pc)
young (~6 Myr) compact cluster around eta Chamaeleontis, obtained with the
European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Paranal, Chile. Our
data, combined with J,H, Ks photometry from the 2-Micron All Sky Survey, reveal
that only two of the 12 members surveyed harbor L'-band excesses consistent
with optically thick inner disks; both are also likely accretors. Intriguingly,
two other stars with possible evidence for on-going accretion, albeit at very
low rates, do not show significant infrared excess: this may imply substantial
grain growth and/or partial clearing of the inner disk region, as expected in
planet formation scenarios. Our findings suggest that eta Cha stars are in an
epoch when disks are rapidly evolving, perhaps due to processes related to
planet building, and provide further constraints on inner disk lifetimes.",2005-06-15T17:18:01Z
"Wide-Angle Wind Driven Bipolar Outflows: High Resolution Models with
  Application to Source I of the Becklin-Neugebauer / Kleinmann-Low OMC-I
  Region","We carry out high resolution simulations of the inner regions of a wide angle
wind driven bipolar outflow using an Adaptive Mesh Refinement code. Our code
follows H-He gas with molecular, atomic and ionic components and the associated
time dependent molecular chemistry and ionization dynamics with radiative
cooling. Our simulations explore the nature of the outflow when a spherical
wind expands into a rotating, collapsing envelope. We compare with key
observational properties of the outflow system of Source I in the BN/KL region.
  Our calculations show that the wind evacuates a bipolar outflow cavity in the
infalling envelope. We find the head of the outflow to be unstable and that it
rapidly fragments into clumps. We resolve the dynamics of the strong shear
layer which defines the side walls of the cavity. We conjecture that this layer
is the likely site of maser emission and examine its morphology and rotational
properties. The shell of swept up ambient gas that delineates the cavity edge
retains its angular momentum. This rotation is roughly consistent with that
observed in the Source I SiO maser spots. The observed proper motions and
line-of-sight velocity are approximately reproduced by the model. The cavity
shell at the base of the flow assumes an X-shaped morphology which is also
consistent with Source I. We conclude that the wide opening angle of the
outflow is evidence that a wide-angle wind drives the Source I outflow and not
a collimated jet.",2005-06-08T03:46:47Z
"Modeling the Physical Structure of the Low Density Pre-protostellar Core
  Lynds 1498","Lynds 1498 is a pre-protostellar core (PPC) and was one of the initial
objects toward which molecular depletion and differentiation was detected.
Despite the considerable scrutiny of L1498, there has not been a extensive
study of the density and temperature structure as derived from radiative
transfer modeling of dust continuum observations. We present deep SCUBA
observations of L1498 at 850 and 450 micron, high resolution BEARS maps of the
N2H+ 1-0 transition, CSO observations of the N2H+ 3-2 transition, and GBT
observations of the C3S 4-3 transition. We also present a comparison of derived
properties between L1498 and nearby PPCs that have been observed at
far-infrared and submillimeter wavelengths. We present a more realistic
treatment of PPC heating which varies the strength of the ISRF, Sisrf, and
includes attenuation of the ISRF due to dust grains at the outer radius of the
core, Av. The best-fitted model consists of a Bonner-Ebert sphere with a
central density of 1 - 3 x 10^4 cm-3, R_o ~ 0.29 pc, 0.5 <= Sisrf <= 1, Av ~ 1
mag, and a nearly isothermal temperature profile of ~ 10.5 K for OH8 opacities.
C3S emission shows a central depletion hole while N2H+ emission is centrally
peaked. The observed depletions of C3S and H2CO, the modest N2H+ abundance, and
a central density that is an order of magnitude lower than other modeled PPCs
suggests that L1498 may be a forming PPC. Our derived temperature and density
profile will improve modeling of molecular line observations that will
explicate the core's kinematical and chemical state. (abridged)",2005-05-09T19:10:42Z
"On the accretion origin of a vast extended stellar disk around the
  Andromeda galaxy","We present the discovery of an inhomogenous, low-surface brightness, extended
disk-like structure around the Andromeda galaxy (M31) based on a large
kinematic survey of more than 2800 stars with the Keck/DEIMOS spectrograph. The
stellar structure spans radii from 15 kpc out to ~40 kpc, with detections out
to R ~ 70 kpc. The constituent stars lag the expected velocity of circular
orbits in the plane of the M31 disk by ~40 kms and have a velocity dispersion
of ~30 kms. The color range on the upper RGB shows a large spread indicative of
a population with a significant range of metallicity. The mean metallicity of
the population, measured from Ca II equivalent widths, is [Fe/H] = -0.9 +/-
0.2. The morphology of the structure is irregular at large radii, and shows a
wealth of substructures which must be transitory in nature, and are almost
certainly tidal debris. The presence of these substructures indicates that the
global entity was formed by accretion. This extended disk follows smoothly on
from the central parts of M31 disk with an exponential density law of
scale-length of 5.1 +/- 0.1 kpc, similar to that of the bright inner disk. The
population possesses similar kinematic and abundance properties over the entire
region where it is detected in the survey. We estimate that the structure
accounts for approximately 10% of the total luminosity of the M31 disk, and
given the huge scale, contains ~30% of the total disk angular momentum. This
finding indicates that at least some galactic stellar disks are vastly larger
than previously thought and are formed, at least in their outer regions,
primarily by accretion. [abridged]",2005-04-06T21:59:14Z
"The Long Term Optical Variability of the BL Lac object S5 0716+714:
  Evidence for a Precessing Jet","We present the historic light curve of the BL Lac object S5 0716+714,
spanning the time interval from 1953 to 2003, built using Asiago archive plates
and our recent CCD observations, together with literature data. The source
shows an evident long term variability, over which well known short term
variations are superposed. In particular, in the period from 1961 to 1983 the
mean brightness of S5 0716+714 remained significantly fainter than that
observed after 1994. Assuming a constant variation rate of the mean magnitude
we can estimate a value of about 0.11 magnitude/year. The simultaneous
occurrence of decreasing ejection velocities of superluminal moving components
in the jet reported by Bach et al. (2005) suggests that both phenomena are
related to the change of the direction of the jet to the line of sight from
about 5 to 0.7 degrees for an approximately constant bulk Lorentz factor of
about 12. A simple explanation is that of a precessing relativistic jet, which
should presently be close to the smallest orientation angle. One can therefore
expect in the next ten years a decrease of the mean brightness of about 1
magnitude.",2005-06-08T14:56:25Z
"The Connection Between Galaxies and Intergalactic Absorption Lines at
  Redshift 2<z<3","Absorption-line spectroscopy of 23 background QSOs and numerous background
galaxies has let us measure the spatial distribution of metals and neutral
hydrogen around 1044 UV-selected galaxies at redshifts 1.8<z<3.3. The typical
galaxy is surrounded to radii r~40 proper kpc by gas that has a large velocity
spread (dv>260 km/s) and produces very strong absorption lines (N_CIV >> 10^14
cm^-2) in the spectra of background objects. Absorption with an average column
density of N_CIV ~ 10^14 cm^-2 extends to 80 kpc, a radius large enough to
imply that most strong intergalactic CIV absorption is associated with
star-forming galaxies like those in our sample. We find that the galaxy-CIV
cross-correlation length increases with CIV column density and is similar to
the galaxy-galaxy length (r_0 ~ 4 h^-1 Mpc) for N_CIV > 10^12.5 cm^-2.
Distortions in the redshift-space galaxy-CIV correlation function on small
scales may imply that some of the CIV systems have large peculiar velocities.
Four of the five detected OVI absorption systems in our sample lie within 400
proper kpc of a known galaxy. Strong Lyman-a absorption is produced by the
intergalactic gas within 1 h^-1 comoving Mpc of most galaxies, but for a
significant minority (~1/3) the absorption is weak or absent. We were unable to
identify any statistically significant differences between galaxies with weak
nearby HI absorption and the rest, although galaxies with weak absorption may
have higher star-formation rates. Galaxies near intergalactic CIV systems
appear to reside in relatively dense environments and to have distinctive
spectral energy distributions that are characterized by blue colors and young
ages. (abridged)",2005-05-06T11:08:06Z
The Distribution of Satellite Galaxies: The Great Pancake,"The 11 known satellite galaxies within 250 kpc of the Milky Way lie close to
a great circle on the sky. We use high resolution N-body simulations of
galactic dark matter halos to test if this remarkable property can be
understood within the context of the cold dark matter cosmology. We construct
halo merger trees from the simulations and use a semianalytic model to follow
the formation of satellite galaxies. We find that in all 6 of our simulations,
the 11 brightest satellites are indeed distributed along thin, disk-like
structures analogous to that traced by the Milky Way's satellites. This is in
sharp contrast to the overall distributions of dark matter in the halo and of
subhalos within it which, although triaxial, are not highly aspherical. We find
that the spatial distribution of satellites is significantly different from
that of the most massive subhalos but is similar to that of the subset of
subhalos that had the most massive progenitors at earlier times. The elongated
disk-like structure delineated by the satellites has its long axis aligned with
the major axis of the dark matter halo. We interpret our results as reflecting
the preferential infall of satellites along the spines of a few filaments of
the cosmic web.",2005-03-18T12:47:10Z
"Low Frequency Radio Observations of X-ray Ghost Bubbles in Abell 2597: A
  History of Radio Activity in the Core","A previous analysis of the Chandra X-ray image of the center of the cooling
core cluster Abell 2597 showed two ``ghost holes'' in the X-ray emission to the
west and northeast of the central radio galaxy PKS 2322-123. Previous radio
observations did not detect any radio emission coming from the interior of the
X-ray holes. We present new low frequency radio observations of Abell 2597. At
330 MHz, radio emission extends into the interior of the western ghost bubble,
but not the northeast one. Our re-analysis of the archival Chandra data shows
evidence for an X-ray tunnel (elongated region of reduced X-ray emission)
extending from near the center of the cD out to the west ghost bubble. We also
detect a smaller X-ray hole to the northeast of the center of the cD and closer
than the outer ghost bubbles. Radio observations at 1.3 GHz show extensions to
the west along the X-ray tunnel toward the west ghost bubble, to the northeast
into the new X-ray hole, and to the northwest. All of these structures are much
larger than the two inner radio lobes seen previously at 8 GHz. The X-ray
tunnel suggests that the west ghost bubble is part of a continuous flow of
radio plasma out from the active galactic nucleus, rather than a detached
buoyant old radio lobe, and thus it may be an intermediate case between an
active radio galaxy and a buoyant lobe.",2005-03-11T21:00:01Z
"Faint Radio Sources in the NOAO Bootes Field. VLBA Imaging and Optical
  Identifications","As a step toward investigating the parsec-scale properties of faint
extragalactic radio sources, the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) was used at
5.0 GHz to obtain phase-referenced images of 76 sources in the NOAO Bootes
field. These 76 sources were selected from the FIRST catalog to have peak flux
densities above 10 mJy at 5 arcsec resolution and deconvolved major diameters
of less than 3 arcsec at 1.4 GHz. Fifty-seven of these faint radio sources were
identified with accretion-powered radio galaxies and quasars brighter than 25.5
mag in the optical I band. On VLA scales at 1.4 GHz, a measure of the
compactness of the faint sources (the ratio of the peak flux density from FIRST
to the integrated flux density from the NVSS catalog) spans the full range of
possibilites arising from source-resolution effects. Thirty of the faint radio
sources, or 39 +9/-7%, were detected with the VLBA at 5.0 GHz with peak flux
densities above 6 sigma ~2 mJy at 2 mas resolution. The VLBA detections occur
through the full range of compactness ratios. The stronger VLBA detections can
themselves serve as phase-reference calibrators, boding well for opening up
much of the radio sky to VLBA imaging. For the adopted cosmology, the VLBA
resolution correponds to 17 pc or finer. Most VLBA detections are unresolved or
slightly resolved but one is diffuse and five show either double or core-jet
structures; the properties of these latter six are discussed in detail. Three
VLBA detections are unidentified and fainter than 25.5 mag in the optical I
band; their properties are highlighted because they likely mark
optically-obscured active nuclei at high redshift.",2005-06-09T05:17:20Z
"Number Density of Bright Lyman-Break Galaxies at z~6 in the Subaru Deep
  Field","We report on the bright Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) selected in a 767
arcmin^2 area of the Subaru Deep Field. The selection is made in the i-zR vs
zB-zR plane, where zB and zR are new bandpasses with a central wavelength of
8842A and 9841A, respectively. This set of bandpasses enables us to separate
well z~6 LBGs from foreground galaxies and Galactic cool stars. We detect 12
LBG candidates down to zR=25.4, and calculate the normalization of the
rest-frame far-ultraviolet (FUV: 1400A) luminosity function at MFUV = -21.6 to
be \phi(-21.6) = (2.6+/-0.7) x 10^{-5} mag^{-1} Mpc^{-3}. This must be the most
reliable measurement ever obtained of the number density of bright z~6 LBGs,
because it is more robust against both contamination and cosmic variance than
previous values. The FUV luminosity density contributed from LBGs brighter than
MFUV = -21.3 is (2.8+/-0.8) x 10^{24} ergs/s/Hz/Mpc^3, which is equivalent to a
star formation rate density of (3.5+/-1.0) x 10^{-4} Msun/yr/Mpc^3. Combining
our measurement with those at z<6 in the literature, we find that the FUV
luminosity density of bright galaxies increases by an order of magnitude from
z~6 to z~3 and then drops by 10^3 from z~3 to the present epoch, while the
evolution of the total luminosity density is much milder. The evolutionary
behavior of bright LBGs resembles that of luminous dusty star-forming galaxies
and bright QSOs. The redshift of z~3 appears to be a remarkable era in the
cosmic history when massive galaxies were being intensively formed.",2005-04-18T05:03:23Z
"Black Hole Masses and Host Galaxy Evolution of Radio-loud Active
  Galactic Nuclei","We report stellar velocity dispersion measurements for a sample of 28 AGN
host galaxies including our previous work. Using the mass-dispersion
($M_{\bullet}-\sigma$) and the fundamental plane relations, we estimate the
black hole mass for a sample of 66 BL Lac objects and investigate the role of
black hole mass in the energetics of BL Lac objects. The black hole mass range
for different BL Lac spectral types is similar, $10^{7} < M_{\bullet} < 4
\times 10^{9}$. Neither X-ray nor radio luminosity correlates with black hole
mass. Low-frequency-peaked BL Lac objects have higher Eddington ratios on
average, because of either more beaming or higher intrinsic power. For the
black hole mass range $3 \times 10^{7} < M_{\bullet} < 10^{9}$, the radio
luminosity of BL Lac objects and flat-spectrum radio quasars spans over 4
orders of magnitude, with BL Lac objects being low-power AGNs. We also
investigate the evolution of host galaxies for 39 AGNs out to $z \approx 0.5$
with measuredstellar velocity dispersions. Comparing the mass-to-light ratio
evolution in the observed frame with population synthesis models, we find that
single burst star formation models with $z_{form} = 1.4^{+0.9}_{-0.2} $ are
consistent with the observations. From our $z_{form}=1.4$ model, we estimated
the intrinsic mass-to-light ratio evolution in the Cousins $R$ band, $\Delta
log (M/L)/ \Delta z = -0.502 \pm 0.08$, consistent with that of normal early
type galaxies.",2005-06-14T19:16:41Z
The Interiors of Giant Planets: Models and Outstanding Questions,"We know that giant planets played a crucial role in the making of our Solar
System. The discovery of giant planets orbiting other stars is a formidable
opportunity to learn more about these objects, what is their composition, how
various processes influence their structure and evolution, and most importantly
how they form. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune can be studied in detail,
mostly from close spacecraft flybys. We can infer that they are all enriched in
heavy elements compared to the Sun, with the relative global enrichments
increasing with distance to the Sun. We can also infer that they possess dense
cores of varied masses. The intercomparison of presently caracterised
extrasolar giant planets show that they are also mainly made of hydrogen and
helium, but that they either have significantly different amounts of heavy
elements, or have had different orbital evolutions, or both. Hence, many
questions remain and are to be answered for significant progresses on the
origins of planets.",2005-02-03T14:29:52Z
The XO Project: Searching for Transiting Extra-solar Planet Candidates,"The XO project's first objective is to find hot Jupiters transiting bright
stars, i.e. V < 12, by precision differential photometry. Two XO cameras have
been operating since September 2003 on the 10,000-foot Haleakala summit on
Maui. Each XO camera consists of a 200-mm f/1.8 lens coupled to a 1024x1024
pixel, thinned CCD operated by drift scanning. In its first year of routine
operation, XO has observed 6.6% of the sky, within six 7 deg-wide strips
scanned from 0 deg to +63 deg of declination and centered at RA=0, 4, 8, 12,
16, and 20 hours. Autonomously operating, XO records 1 billion pixels per clear
night, calibrates them photometrically and astrometrically, performs aperture
photometry, archives the pixel data and transmits the photometric data to STScI
for further analysis. From the first year of operation, the resulting database
consists of photometry of 100,000 stars at more than 1000 epochs per star with
differential photometric precision better than 1% per epoch. Analysis of the
light curves of those stars produces transiting-planet candidates requiring
detailed follow up, described elsewhere, culminating in spectroscopy to measure
radial-velocity variation in order to differentiate genuine planets from the
more numerous impostors, primarily eclipsing binary and multiple stars.",2005-05-27T16:57:06Z
"Possibility of Ultra High-Energy Cosmic Rays from the Giant Flare in SGR
  1806-20","On 2004 December 27, a giant flare from the soft gamma repeater 1806$-$20 was
observed. The radiation mechanism of the initial peak of the flare would be
controversial. In this letter we point out that very high-energy cosmic rays
would be produced in the case that the flare was caused by internal shocks, as
is usually considered for gamma-ray bursts. The highest energy of cosmic rays
can reach $10^{19}$ eV, if the Lorentz factor of the shocks is sufficiently
high. Future observations of cosmic rays will inform us about the mechanism of
the giant flare.",2005-03-16T04:02:41Z
Optical novae: the major class of supersoft X-ray sources in M 31,"We searched for X-ray counterparts of optical novae detected in M 31 and M
33. We combined an optical nova catalogue from the WeCAPP survey with optical
novae reported in the literature and correlated them with the most recent X-ray
catalogues from ROSAT, XMM-Newton and Chandra, and - in addition - searched for
nova correlations in archival data. We report 21 X-ray counterparts for novae
in M 31 - mostly identified as supersoft sources (SSS) by their hardness ratios
- and two in M 33. Our sample more than triples the number of known optical
novae with supersoft X-ray phase. Most of the counterparts are covered in
several observations allowing us to constrain their X-ray light curves.
Selected brighter sources were classified by their XMM-Newton EPIC spectra. We
use the well determined start time of the SSS state in two novae to estimate
the hydrogen mass ejected in the outburst to ~10^{-5}M_sun and ~10^{-6}M_sun,
respectively. The supersoft X-ray phase of at least 15% of the novae starts
within a year. At least one of the novae shows a SSS state lasting 6.1 years
after the optical outburst. Six of the SSSs turned on between 3 and 9 years
after the optical discovery of the outburst and may be interpreted as recurrent
novae. If confirmed, the detection of a delayed SSS phase turn-on may be used
as a new method to classify novae as recurrent. At the moment, the new method
yields a ratio of recurrent novae to classical novae of 0.3 which is in
agreement (within the errors) with previous works.",2005-04-14T11:57:12Z
Observation of small scale structure using sextupole lensing,"Weak gravitational lensing seeks to determine shear by measuring induced
quadrupole (elliptical) shapes in background galaxy images. Small impact
parameter (a few kpc) gravitational lensing by foreground core masses between 2
10^{9} and 2 10^{12} M_\odot will additionally induce a sextupole shape with
the quadrupole and sextupole minima aligned. This correlation in relative
orientation of the quadrupole and sextupole provides a sensitive method to
identify images which have been slightly curved by lensing events. A general
theoretical framework for sextupole lensing is developed which includes several
low order coefficients in a general lensing map. Tools to impute map
coefficients from the galaxy images are described and applied to the north
Hubble deep field. Instrumental PSFs, camera charge diffusion, and image
composition methods are modelled in the coefficient determination process.
Estimates of Poisson counting noise for each galaxy are used to cut galaxies
with signals too small to reliably establish curvature. Curved galaxies are
found to be spatially clumped, as would be expected if the curving were due to
small impact parameter lensing by localized ensembles of dark matter haloes.
Simulations provide an estimate of the total required lensing mass and the
acceptable mass range of the constituent haloes. The overdensities and
underdensities of visible galaxies and their locations in the Hubble foreground
is found to be consistent with our observations and their interpretation as
lensing events.",2005-04-08T19:51:11Z
"Line Polarization of Molecular Lines at Radio Frequencies: The case of
  DR21(OH)","We present polarization observations in DR21(OH) from thermal dust emission
at 3 mm and from CO J=1-0 line emission. The observations were obtained using
the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association array. Previous observations of this
region at 1.3 mm for the polarized continuum emission, and also the CO J=2-1
polarized emission have been made before. Our continuum polarization results
are consistent with those results. However, the direction of the linear
polarization for the J=1-0 is perpendicular to that of the CO J=2-1
polarization. This unexpected result was explored by obtaining numerical
solutions to the multilevel, radiative transfer equations for a gas with
anisotropic optical depths. We find that in addition to the anisotropic optical
depths, anisotropic excitation due to a source of radiation that is external to
the CO is needed to understand the orthogonality in the directions of
polarization. The continuum emission by dust grains at the core of DR21(OH) is
sufficient to provide this external radiation. The CO polarization must arise
in relatively low density (nH2 ~ 100 [cm^-3]) envelope gas. We infer B ~ 10
[micro Gauss] in this gas, which implies that the envelope is subcritical.",2005-04-12T03:02:22Z
"Using the photons from the Crab Nebula seen by GLAST to calibrate MAGIC
  and the Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes","In this article we discuss the possibility of using the observations by GLAST
of standard gamma sources, as the Crab Nebula, to calibrate Imaging Air
Cherenkov detectors, MAGIC in particular, and optimise their energy resolution.
We show that at around 100 GeV the absolute energy calibration uncertainty of
Cherenkov telescopes can be reduced to <10% by means of such cross-calibration
procedure.",2005-04-13T17:27:36Z
"Constraining beta(z) and Omega_m from redshift-space distortions in z~3
  galaxy surveys","We use sample of 813 Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) with 2.6<z<3.4 to perform a
detailed analysis of the redshift-space (z-space) distortions in their
clustering pattern and from them derive confidence levels in the
[Omega_m,beta(z=3)] plane. We model the z-space distortions in the shape of the
correlation function measured in orthogonal directions, xi(sigma,pi). This
modeling requires an accurate description of the real-space correlation
function to be given as an input. From the projection of xi(sigma,pi) in the
angular direction, w_p(sigma), we derive the best fitting amplitude and slope
for the LBG real-space correlation function: r_0=4.48(+0.17)(-0.18) h(-1) Mpc
and gamma=1.76(+0.08)(-0.09) (xi(r)= (r/r_0)^-gamma). A comparison between the
shape of xi(s) and w_p(sigma) suggests that xi(r) deviates from a simple
power-law model, with a break at ~9 h(-1) Mpc. This model is consistent with
the observed projected correlation function. However, due to the limited size
of the fields used, the w_p(sigma) results are limited to sigma < 10 h(-1) Mpc.
Assuming this double power-law model, and by analysing the shape distortions in
xi(sigma,pi), we find the following constraints: beta(z=3) = 0.15
(+0.20)(-0.15), Omega_m = 0.35 (+0.65)(-0.22). Combining these results with
orthogonal constraints from linear evolution of density perturbations, we find
that beta(z=3) = 0.25 (+0.05)(-0.06), Omega_m = 0.55 (+0.45)(-0.16).",2005-05-23T09:07:08Z
A brief introduction to cosmic topology,"Whether we live in a spatially finite universe, and what its shape and size
may be, are among the fundamental long-standing questions in cosmology. These
questions of topological nature have become particularly topical, given the
wealth of increasingly accurate astro-cosmological observations, especially the
recent observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation. An overview
of the basic context of cosmic topology, the detectability constraints from
recent observations, as well as the main methods for its detection and some
recent results are briefly presented.",2005-04-16T22:40:27Z
"A Comparison of Elemental Abundance Ratios in Globular Clusters, Field
  Stars, and Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies","We have compiled a sample of globular clusters with high quality stellar
abundances from the literature to compare to the chemistries of stars in the
Galaxy and those in dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Of the 45 globular clusters
examined, 29 also have kinematic information. Most of the globular clusters
belong to the Galactic halo, however a signficant number have disk kinematics
or belong to the bulge. Focusing on the [alpha/Fe] and light r-process element
ratios, we find that most globular cluster stars mimic those of the field stars
of similar metallicities, and neither clearly resembles the presently available
stellar abundances in the dwarf galaxies (including the globular clusters in
the Large Magellanic Cloud). The exceptions to these general elemental ratio
comparisons are already known in the literature, e.g., omega Centauri, Palomar
12, and Terzan 7 associated with the Sagittarius remnant, and Ruprecht 106
which has a high radial velocity and low [alpha/Fe] ratio. A few other globular
clusters show more marginal peculiarities. The most notable one being the halo
cluster M68 which has a high Galactocentric rotational velocity, a slightly
younger age, and a unique [Si/Ti] ratio. The [Si/Ti] ratios decrease with
increasing [Fe/H] at intermediate metallicities, which is consistent with very
massive stars playing a larger role in the early chemical evolution of the
Galaxy. The chemical similarities between globular clusters and field stars
with [Fe/H]<-1.0 suggests a shared chemical history in a well mixed early
Galaxy. The differences to the published chemistries of stars in the dwarf
spheroidal galaxies suggests that neither the globular clusters, halo stars,
nor thick disk stars had their origins in small isolated systems like the
present-day Milky Way dwarf satellites.",2005-06-10T14:02:09Z
"Evolution in the Cluster Early-type Galaxy Size-Surface Brightness
  Relation at z =~ 1","We investigate the evolution in the distribution of surface brightness, as a
function of size, for elliptical and S0 galaxies in the two clusters RDCS
J1252.9-2927, z=1.237 and RX J0152.7-1357, z=0.837. We use multi-color imaging
with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope to determine
these sizes and surface brightnesses. Using three different estimates of the
surface brightnesses, we find that we reliably estimate the surface brightness
for the galaxies in our sample with a scatter of < 0.2 mag and with systematic
shifts of \lesssim 0.05 mag. We construct samples of galaxies with early-type
morphologies in both clusters. For each cluster, we use a magnitude limit in a
band which closely corresponds to the rest-frame B, to magnitude limit of M_B =
-18.8 at z=0, and select only those galaxies within the color-magnitude
sequence of the cluster or by using our spectroscopic redshifts. We measure
evolution in the rest-frame B surface brightness, and find -1.41 \+/- 0.14 mag
from the Coma cluster of galaxies for RDCS J1252.9-2927 and -0.90 \+/- 0.12 mag
of evolution for RX J0152.7-1357, or an average evolution of (-1.13 \+/- 0.15)
z mag. Our statistical errors are dominated by the observed scatter in the
size-surface brightness relation, sigma = 0.42 \+/- 0.05 mag for RX
J0152.7-1357 and sigma = 0.76 \+/- 0.10 mag for RDCS J1252.9-2927. We find no
statistically significant evolution in this scatter, though an increase in the
scatter could be expected. Overall, the pace of luminosity evolution we measure
agrees with that of the Fundamental Plane of early-type galaxies, implying that
the majority of massive early-type galaxies observed at z =~ 1 formed at high
redshifts.",2005-03-16T18:43:31Z
"Constraints on Topological Defects Energy Density from First-Year WMAP
  Results","We compare the predictions of hybrid inflationary models that produce both
adiabatic fluctuations and topological defects to first year WMAP results. We
use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to constrain the contribution of cosmic
strings and textures to the CMB angular power spectrum. Marginalizing this
contribution over the cosmological parameters of a power law flat LCDM model,
we place a 95% upper limit of 23% on the topological defects contribution to
density fluctuations, the maximum likelihood being of order 4%. This
corresponds to an upper limit on the string scale of G\mu \leq 3.2 \times
10^{-7}. We also explore the degeneracies between the defects contribution and
other cosmological parameters.",2005-03-17T22:04:59Z
"The Intermediate-band Dropout Method: A New Method to Search for
  High-Redshift Galaxies","We propose a new method to search for high-redshift galaxies that is based on
an intermediate-band dropout technique rather than the usual broad-band dropout
one. In this method, we use an intermediate-band filter whose central
wavelength is longer than 7000 \AA. This new method makes it possible to
distinguish both very late-type stars such as L and T dwarfs and dusty galaxies
at intermediate redshift from real high-$z$ Lyman break galaxies. The reason
for this is that such interlopers do not show strong intermediate-band
depression although they have very red broad-band colors that are indicative of
Lyman break galaxies. Applying our new method to imaging data sets obtained
with the Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope, we find a new sample of Lyman
break galaxies at $z \simeq 5$.",2005-02-17T00:44:10Z
Mass-Varying Neutrinos from a Variable Cosmological Constant,"We consider, in a completely model-independent way, the transfer of energy
between the components of the dark energy sector consisting of the cosmological
constant (CC) and that of relic neutrinos. We show that such a cosmological
setup may promote neutrinos to mass-varying particles, thus resembling a
recently proposed scenario of Fardon, Nelson, and Weiner (FNW), but now without
introducing any acceleronlike scalar fields. Although a formal similarity of
the FNW scenario with the variable CC one can be easily established, one
nevertheless finds different laws for neutrino mass variation in each scenario.
We show that as long as the neutrino number density dilutes canonically, only a
very slow variation of the neutrino mass is possible. For neutrino masses to
vary significantly (as in the FNW scenario), a considerable deviation from the
canonical dilution of the neutrino number density is also needed. We note that
the present `coincidence' between the dark energy density and the neutrino
energy density can be obtained in our scenario even for static neutrino masses.",2005-05-25T10:59:41Z
Likelihood Estimation of Gamma Ray Bursts Duration Distribution,"Two classes of Gamma Ray Bursts have been identified so far, characterized by
T90 durations shorter and longer than approximately 2 seconds. It was shown
that the BATSE 3B data allow a good fit with three Gaussian distributions in
log T90. In the same Volume in ApJ. another paper suggested that the third
class of GRBs is may exist. Using the full BATSE catalog here we present the
maximum likelihood estimation, which gives us 0.5% probability to having only
two subclasses. The MC simulation confirms this probability.",2005-06-15T06:55:51Z
"Influence of the Coriolis force on the instability of slowly pulsating B
  stars","This paper explores the effect of rotation on the kappa-mechanism instability
of slowly pulsating B stars. A new nonadiabatic code, that adopts the so-called
`traditional approximation' to treat the Coriolis force, is used to investigate
the influence exerted by rotation over the stability of stellar models covering
the mass range 2.5 M_sun <= M_* <= 13.0 M_sun. The principal finding is that,
for all modes considered apart from the prograde sectoral class, rotation
shifts the kappa-mechanism instability toward higher luminosities and effective
temperatures; these shifts are accompanied by broadenings in the extent of
instability strips. Such behaviour is traced to the shortening of mode periods
under the action of the Coriolis force. Instability strips associated with
prograde sectoral modes behave rather differently, being shifted to marginally
lower luminosities and effective temperatures under the influence of rotation.
  The implications of these results are discussed in the context of the
observational scarcity of pulsation in B-type stars having significant
rotation; various scenarios are explored to explain the apparent dichotomy
between theory and observations. Furthermore, the possible significance of the
findings to Be stars is briefly examined.",2005-03-08T19:26:31Z
"Gravitomagnetic Effects on Collective Plasma Oscillations in Compact
  Stars","The effects of gravitomagnetic force on plasma oscillations are investigated
using the kinetic theory of homogeneous electrically neutral plasma in the
absence of external electric or magnetic field. The random phase assumption is
employed neglecting the thermal motion of the electrons with respect to a fixed
ion background. It is found that the gravitomagnetic force reduces the
characteristic frequency of the plasma thus enhancing the refractive index of
the medium. The estimates for the predicted effects are given for a typical
white dwarf, pulsar, and neutron star.",2005-05-11T12:34:43Z
Recent results from the Milagro TeV gamma-ray observatory,"Milagro is a gamma-ray observatory employing a water Cherenkov detector to

the Earth's atmosphere. We discuss the first detection of TeV gamma-rays from
the Galactic plane and report the detection of an extended TeV source
coincident with the EGRET source 3EG J0520+2556, and the observation of TeV
emission from the Cygnus region of our Galaxy. We also summarize the status of
our search for Very High Energy (VHE) emission from satellite-triggered Gamma

"A Possible Formation Scenario for the Ultra-Massive Cluster W3 in NGC
  7252","The intermediate age star cluster W3 (age ~ 300-500 Myr) in NGC 7252 is the
most luminous star cluster known to date with a dynamical mass estimate of 8
+/- 2 x 10^7 M_sun. With an effective radius of about 17.5 pc and a velocity
dispersion of 45 km/s this object may be viewed as one of the recently
discovered ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs). Its intermediate age, however,
precludes an origin as a stripped nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxy. The galaxy
NGC 7252 is a merger remnant from two gas-rich disc galaxies. Interactions
between two gas-rich galaxies lead to bursts of intense star formation. The age
of the interaction and the age of W3 are in good agreement, suggesting that was
W3 probably formed in the starburst. We propose a formation scenario for W3.
Observations of interacting galaxies reveal regions of strong star formation
forming dozens up to hundreds of star cluster in confined regions of up to
several hundred parsec in diameter. The total mass of new stars in these
regions can reach 10^7 or even 10^8 M_sun. By means of numerical simulations we
have shown that the star clusters in these regions merge on short time-scales
of a few Myr up to a few hundred Myr. We apply this scenario to W3 and predict
properties which could be observable and the future evolution of this object.
This work lends credence to the notion that at least some of the UCDs may be
evolved star cluster complexes formed during early hierarchical mergers.",2005-02-04T16:47:49Z
The First Generation of Star-Forming Haloes,"We model gas cooling in high-resolution N-body simulations in order to
investigate the formation of the first generation of stars. We follow a region
of a LCDM universe especially selected to contain a rich cluster by the present
day. The properties of the dark haloes that form in these sub-solar mass
resolution simulations are presented in a companion paper by Gao et al. The
first gas clouds able to cool by molecular hydrogen line emission collapse at
extremely high redshift, z ~ 47, when the mass of the dark halo is 2.4 x 10^5
Msun/h. By z ~ 30, a substantial population of haloes are capable of undergoing
molecular hydrogen cooling although their ability to form stars is dependent on
the efficiency of feedback processes such as dissociating Lyman-Werner
radiation. The mass of the main halo grows extremely rapidly and, by z ~ 36,
its virial temperature has reached 10^4K, at which point gas cooling becomes
dominated by more effective atomic line processes. By z ~ 30, a small ``group''
of such potential galaxies will have formed unless prevented from doing so by
feedback processes. By this redshift, massive (>~ 100 Msun) population III
stars are able to ionise gas well beyond their own host halo and neighbouring
HII regions can percolate to form an ionized superbubble. Such patches would be
too widely separated to contribute significantly to reionisation at this time.
The large number density of early cooling haloes in the pre-reionised universe
raises the exciting prospect that this ultra-early generation of stars may be
observable as gamma-ray bursts or supernovae.",2005-04-04T19:12:03Z
The Sources of Intergalactic Metals,"We study the clustering properties of metals in the intergalactic medium
(IGM) as traced by 619 CIV, 81 SiIV, N >= 10^12 cm^-2 and 316 MgII, and 82 FeII
N >= 10^11.5 cm^-2 absorption components in 19 high signal-to-noise (60-100 per
pixel), high resolution (R = 45000) quasar spectra. Over the redshift range
probed (1.5-3.0), CIV and SiIV trace each other closely and their line-of-sight
correlation functions exhibit a steep decline at large separations and a
flatter profile below ~ 150 km s^-1, with a large overall bias. These features
do not depend on column depth. Carrying out a detailed SPH simulation (2 X
320^3, 57 Mpc^3 comoving), we show that this behavior can not be reproduced by
models in which the IGM metallicity is constant or a local function of density.
However, the CIV correlation function is consistent with a model in which
metals are confined within bubbles with a typical radius Rs = 2 comoving Mpc
about sources of mass >= Ms = 10^12 solar masses at z=3. Our lower redshift
(0.5-2) measurements of the MgII and FeII correlation functions also uncover a
steep decline at large separations and a flatter profile at small separations,
but the clustering is even higher, and the turn-over is shifted to ~ 75 km
s^-1. Again these features do not change with column depth. We describe an
analytical bubble model for these species, which come from regions that are too
compact to be simulated numerically, deriving best-fit values of R_s ~ 2.4 Mpc
and M_s ~ 10^12 solar masses. Equally good fits to all four species are found
in a similarly biased high-redshift enrichment model in which metals are placed
within 2.4 comoving Mpc of 3 x 10^9 solar mass sources at z = 7.5.",2005-02-28T21:01:29Z
Extra-planar gas in the spiral galaxy NGC 4559,"We present 21-cm line observations of the spiral galaxy NGC 4559, made with
the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope. We have used them to study the HI
distribution and kinematics, the relative amount and distribution of luminous
and dark matter in this galaxy and, in particular, the presence of extra-planar
gas. Our data do reveal the presence of such a component, in the form of a
thick disk, with a mass of 5.9 x 10^8 Mo (one tenth of the total HI mass) and a
mean rotation velocity 25-50 km/s lower than that of the thin disk. The
extra-planar gas may be the result of galactic fountains but accretion from the
IGM cannot be ruled out. With this study we confirm that lagging, thick HI
layers are likely to be common in spiral galaxies.",2005-04-25T09:23:39Z
Electric field representation of pulsar intensity spectra,"Pulsar dynamic spectra exhibit high visibility fringes arising from
interference between scattered radio waves. These fringes may be random or
highly ordered patterns, depending on the nature of the scattering or
refraction. Here we consider the possibility of decomposing pulsar dynamic
spectra -- which are intensity measurements -- into their constituent scattered
waves, i.e. electric field components. We describe an iterative method of
achieving this decomposition and show how the algorithm performs on data from
the pulsar B0834+06. The match between model and observations is good, although
not formally acceptable as a representation of the data. Scattered wave
components derived in this way are immediately useful for qualitative insights
into the scattering geometry. With some further development this approach can
be put to a variety of uses, including: imaging the scattering and refracting
structures in the interstellar medium; interstellar interferometric imaging of
pulsars at very high angular resolution; and mitigating pulse arrival time
fluctuations due to interstellar scattering.",2005-02-25T11:02:06Z
"Cosmological non-Gaussian Signature Detection: Comparing Performance of
  Different Statistical Tests","Currently, it appears that the best method for non-Gaussianity detection in
the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) consists in calculating the kurtosis of
the wavelet coefficients. We know that wavelet-kurtosis outperforms other
methods such as the bispectrum, the genus, ridgelet-kurtosis and
curvelet-kurtosis on an empirical basis, but relatively few studies have
compared other transform-based statistics, such as extreme values, or more
recent tools such as Higher Criticism (HC), or proposed `best possible' choices
for such statistics.
  In this paper we consider two models for transform-domain coefficients: (a) a
power-law model, which seems suited to the wavelet coefficients of simulated
cosmic strings; and (b) a sparse mixture model, which seems suitable for the
curvelet coefficients of filamentary structure. For model (a), if power-law
behavior holds with finite 8-th moment, excess kurtosis is an asymptotically
optimal detector, but if the 8-th moment is not finite, a test based on extreme
values is asymptotically optimal. For model (b), if the transform coefficients
are very sparse, a recent test, Higher Criticism, is an optimal detector, but
if they are dense, kurtosis is an optimal detector. Empirical wavelet
coefficients of simulated cosmic strings have power-law character, infinite
8-th moment, while curvelet coefficients of the simulated cosmic strings are
not very sparse. In all cases, excess kurtosis seems to be an effective test in
moderate-resolution imagery.",2005-03-16T21:49:11Z
"Accretion in dipole magnetic fields: flow structure and X-ray emission
  of accreting white dwarfs","Field-channelled accretion flows occur in a variety of astrophysical objects,
including T Tauri stars,magnetic cataclysmic variables and X-ray pulsars. We
consider a curvilinear coordinate system and derive a general hydrodynamic
formulation for accretion onto stellar objects confined by a stellar dipole
magnetic field. The hydrodynamic equations are solved to determine the
velocity, density and temperature profiles of the flow. We use accreting
magnetic white-dwarf stars as an illustrative example of astrophysical
applications. Our calculations show that the compressional heating due to the
field geometry is as important as radiative cooling and gravity in determining
the structure of the post-shock flow in accreting white-dwarf stars. The
generalisation of the formulation to accretion flows channelled by higher-order
fields and the applications to other astrophysical systems are discussed.",2005-04-04T08:48:24Z
Stochastic chemical enrichment in metal-poor systems I. Theory,"A stochastic model of the chemical enrichment of metal-poor systems by
core-collapse (Type II) supernovae is presented, allowing for large-scale
mixing of the enriched material by turbulent motions and cloud collisions in
the interstellar medium. Infall of pristine material is taken into account by
following the evolution of the gas density in the medium. Analytical
expressions were derived for the number of stars enriched by a given number of
supernovae, as well as for the amount of mass with which the ejected material
from a supernova is mixed before being locked up in a subsequently formed star.
It is shown that for reasonable values of the gas density (~0.1 cm-3) and of
the supernova rate (~0.25 kpc-3 Myr-1) of the Galactic halo, the resulting
metallicity distributions of the extreme Population II stars show a distinct
cut-off at [Fe/H] ~= -4. In fact, by assuming no low-mass Population III stars
were able to form out of the primordial interstellar medium, the derived
fraction of stars below [Fe/H] = -4 is in agreement with observations.
Moreover, the probability is high that even the most metal-poor stars observed
to date have been enriched by several contributing supernovae. This partly
explains the relatively small star-to-star scatter in many chemical-abundance
ratios for stars down to [Fe/H] = -4, as recently found in several
observational studies. Contribution from the thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae
is found to be negligible over almost the entire extremely metal-poor regime.

Reply to Lyutikov's comments on Zhang & Kobayashi (2005),"Lyutikov (astro-ph/0503505) raised a valid point that for shock deceleration
of a highly magnetized outflow, the fate of the magnetic fields after shock
crossing should be considered. However, his comment that the deceleration
radius should be defined by the total energy rather than by the baryonic
kinetic energy is incorrect. As strictly derived from the shock jump conditions
in Zhang & Kobayashi (2005), during the reverse shock crossing process the
magnetic energy is not tapped. As a result, the fireball deceleration radius is
defined by the baryonic energy only. The magnetic energy is expected to be
transferred to the circumburst medium after the reverse shock disappears. The
evolution of the system then mimicks a continuously-fed fireball. As a result,
Lyutikov's naive conclusion that the forward shock dynamics is independent on
the ejecta content is also incorrect. The shock deceleration dynamics and the
reverse shock calculation presented in Zhang & Kobayashi (2005) are robust and
correct.",2005-04-19T21:12:23Z
Identifying Near Earth Object Families,"The study of asteroid families has provided tremendous insight into the
forces that sculpted the main belt and continue to drive the collisional and
dynamical evolution of asteroids. The identification of asteroid families
within the NEO population could provide a similar boon to studies of their
formation and interiors. In this study we examine the purported identification
of NEO families by Drummond (2000) and conclude that it is unlikely that they
are anything more than random fluctuations in the distribution of NEO
osculating orbital elements. We arrive at this conclusion after examining the
expected formation rate of NEO families, the identification of NEO groups in
synthetic populations that contain no genetically related NEOs, the orbital
evolution of the largest association identified by Drummond (2000), and the
decoherence of synthetic NEO families intended to reproduce the observed
members of the same association. These studies allowed us to identify a new
criterion that can be used to select real NEO families for further study in
future analyses, based on the ratio of the number of pairs and the size of
strings to the number of objects in an identified association.",2005-05-12T23:11:58Z
"Radiative transfer problem in dusty galaxies: effects of non-isotropic
  multiple scattering","We investigate the effects of multiple anisotropic light scattering by
interstellar dust particles on photometric profiles of disk galaxy models
computed using an iterative ray-tracing radiative transfer modeling code. It is
shown that anisotropic scattering must be fully accounted for in at least the
first scattering event for all considered cases. At the same time scattering
terms of the order higher than 5th can be safely approximated using the
isotropic phase function. The effects of isotropic approximation are most
significant in the galaxy models seen face-on with dust population extending
beyond the stellar disk, therefore the applicability of isotropic approximation
to a higher-order (2 to 5) scattering terms depends on the assumed galaxy model
parameters, namely, the optical depth, scattering albedo and the distribution
of interstellar dust with respect to stars.",2005-04-27T19:30:36Z
"Solutions for 10,000 Eclipsing Binaries in the Bulge Fields of OGLE II
  Using DEBiL","We have developed a fully-automated pipeline for systematically identifying
and analyzing eclipsing binaries within large datasets of light curves. The
pipeline is made up of multiple tiers which subject the light curves to
increasing levels of scrutiny. After each tier, light curves that did not
conform to a given criteria were filtered out of the pipeline, reducing the
load on the following, more computationally intensive tiers. As a central
component of the pipeline, we created the fully automated Detached Eclipsing
Binary Light curve fitter (DEBiL), which rapidly fits large numbers of light
curves to a simple model. Using the results of DEBiL, light curves of interest
can be flagged for follow-up analysis. As a test case, we analyzed the 218699
light curves within the bulge fields of the OGLE II survey and produced 10862
model fits. We point out a small number of extreme examples as well as
unexpected structure found in several of the population distributions. We
expect this approach to become increasingly important as light curve datasets
continue growing in both size and number.",2005-04-18T20:04:04Z
"Enhanced X-ray variability from V1647 Ori, the young star in outburst
  illuminating McNeil's Nebula","We report a ~38 ks X-ray observation of McNeil's Nebula obtained with XMM on
2004 April 4. V1647 Ori, the young star in outburst illuminating McNeil's
Nebula, is detected with XMM and appears variable in X-rays. We investigate the
hardness ratio variability and time variations of the event energy distribution
with quantile analysis, and show that the large increase of the count rate from
V1647 Ori observed during the second half of the observation is not associated
with any large plasma temperature variations as for typical X-ray flares from
young low-mass stars. X-ray spectral fitting shows that the bulk (~75%) of the
intrinsic X-ray emission in the 0.5-8 keV energy band comes from a soft plasma
component (0.9 keV) reminiscent of the X-ray spectrum of the classical T Tauri
star TW Hya, for which X-ray emission is believed to be generated by an
accretion shock onto the photosphere of a low-mass star. The hard plasma
component (4.2 keV) contributes ~25% of the total X-ray emission, and can be
understood only in the framework of plasma heating sustained by magnetic
reconnection events. We find a hydrogen column density of NH=4.1E22 cm-2, which
points out a significant excess of hydrogen column density compared to the
value derived from optical/IR observations, consistent with the picture of the
rise of a wind/jet unveiled from ground optical spectroscopy. The X-ray flux
observed with XMM ranges from roughly the flux observed by Chandra on 2004
March 22 (~10 times greater than the pre-outburst X-ray flux) to a value two
times greater than that caught by Chandra on 2004 March 7 (~200 times greater
than the pre-outburst X-ray flux). We have investigated the possibility that
V1647 Ori displays a periodic variation in X-ray brightness as suggested by the
combined Chandra+XMM data set (abridged).",2005-04-05T15:18:42Z
"A Chandra Observation of the Nearby Lenticular Galaxy NGC 5102: Where
  are the X-ray Binaries?","We present results from a 34 ks Chandra/ACIS-S observation of the nearby
(d=3.1 Mpc) lenticular galaxy NGC 5102, previously shown to have an unusually
low X-ray luminosity. We detect eleven X-ray point sources within the the
$D_{25}$ optical boundary of the galaxy (93% of the light), one third to one
half of which are likely to be background AGN. One source is coincident with
the optical nucleus and may be a low-luminosity AGN. Only two sources with an
X-ray luminosity greater than 10$^{37}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ in the 0.5-5.0 keV band
were detected, one of which is statistically likely to be a background AGN. We
expected to detect 6 such luminous sources if the XRB population scales
linearly with optical magnitude of the host galaxy. NGC 5102 has an unusually
low number of XRBs. NGC 5102 is unusually blue for its morphological type, and
has undergone at least two recent bursts of star formation. We present the
results of optical/UV spectral synthesis analysis and demonstrate that a
significant fraction ($>$50%) of the stars in this galaxy are comparatively
young ($<3\times10^9$ years old). If the lack of X-ray binaries is related to
the relative youth of most of the stars, this would support models of LMXB
formation and evolution that require wide binaries to shed angular momentum on
a timescale of Gyrs. We find that NGC 5102 has an unusually low specific
frequency of globular clusters ($S_N\sim$0.4), which could also explain the
lack of LMXBs. We also detect diffuse X-ray emission in the central $\sim$1 kpc
of the galaxy. This hot gas is most likely a superbubble created by multiple
supernovae of massive stars born during the most recent star burst, and is
driving the shock into the ISM which was inferred from optical observations.",2005-05-19T14:00:33Z
"Weak lensing in the second post-Newtonian approximation: Gravitomagnetic
  potentials and the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect","Dark matter currents in the large-scale structure give rise to
gravitomagnetic terms in the metric, which affect the light propagation.
Corrections to the weak lensing power spectrum due to these gravitomagnetic
potentials are evaluated by perturbation theory. A connection between
gravitomagnetic lensing and the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (iSW) effect is drawn,
which can be described by a line-of-sight integration over the divergence of
the gravitomagnetic vector potential. This allows the power spectrum of the
iSW-effect to be derived within the framework of the same formalism as derived
for gravitomagnetic lensing and reduces the iSW-effect to a second order
lensing phenomenon. The three-dimensional power spectra are projected by means
of a generalised Limber-equation to yield the angular power spectra. While
gravitomagnetic corrections to the weak lensing spectrum are negligible at
observationally accessible scales, the angular power spectrum of the iSW-effect
should be detectable as a correction to the CMB spectrum up to multipoles of l
\~ 100 with the PLANCK-satellite.",2005-02-10T13:37:05Z
New High-Redshift Galaxies at $z$ = 5.8 - 6.5 in the Subaru Deep Field,"In order to search for high-redshift galaxies around $z \sim 6$ in the Subaru
Deep Field, we have investigated NB816-dropout galaxies where NB816 is the
narrowband filter centered at 815nm with FWHM of 12.5 nm for the Suprime-Cam on
the Subaru Telescope. Since the NB816 imaging is so deep we can detect 10
well-defined NB816-dropout galaxies that we identify to lie at $z$ = 5.8 --
6.5. We discuss their observational properties.",2005-05-30T07:00:20Z
"Exploring a deep meridional flow hypothesis for a circulation dominated
  solar dynamo model","Circulation-dominated solar dynamo models, which employ a helioseismic
rotation profile and a fixed meridional flow, give a good approximation to the
large scale solar magnetic phenomena, such as the 11-year cycle or the so
called Hale's law of polarities. Nevertheless, the larger amplitude of the
radial shear at the high latitudes makes the dynamo to produce a strong
toroidal magnetic field at high latitudes, in contradiction with the
observations of the sunspots (Sporer`s Law). A possible solution was proposed
by Nandy and Choudhur (2002) in which a deep meridional flow can conduct the
magnetic field inside of a stable layer (the radiative core) and then allow
that it erupts just at lower latitudes. We have recently explored this
hypothesis in a different approximation, using the magnetic buoyancy mechanism
proposed by Dikpaty and Charbonneau (1999) and found that a deep meridional
flow pushes the maximum of the toroidal magnetic field towards the solar
equator, but, in contrast to Nandy and Choudhuri (2002), a second zone of
maximum fields remains at the poles (Guerrero and Munoz (2004)). We here review
these results and also discuss a new possible scenario where the tachocline has
an ellipsoidal shape, following early helioseismologic observations Charbonneau
et. al., (1999), and find that the modification of the geometry of the
tachocline can lead to results which are in good agreement with observations
and opens the possibility to explore in more detail, through the dynamo model,
the place where the magnetic field could be really stored.",2005-04-04T18:55:11Z
Velocity Dispersion of Excited H2,"We present a study of the high rotational bands (J > 2) of H2 toward 4 early
type galactic stars: HD 73882, HD 192639, HD 206267, and HD 207538. In each
case, the velocity dispersion - characterized by the spectrum fitting parameter
b - increases with the level of excitation, a phenomenon that has previously
been detected by the Copernicus and IMAPS observatories. In particular, we show
with 4 sigma confidence that for HD 192639 it is not possible to fit all J
levels with a single b value, and that higher b values are needed for the
higher levels. The amplitude of the line broadening, which can be as high as 10
km s^-1, makes explanations such as inhomogeneous spatial distribution
unlikely. We investigate a mechanism in which the broadening is due to the
molecules that are rotationally excited through the excess energy acquired
after their formation on a grain (H2-formation pumping). We show that different
dispersions would be a natural consequence of this mechanism. We note however
that such process would require a formation rate 10 times higher then what was
inferred from other observations. In view of the difficulty to account for the
velocity dispersion as thermal broadening (T would be around 10,000 K), we
conclude then that we are most certainly observing some highly turbulent warm
layer associated with the cold diffuse cloud. Embedded in a magnetic field, it
could be responsible for the high quantities of CH+ measured in the cold
neutral medium.",2005-03-18T18:29:09Z
"Robust determination of optical path difference: fringe tracking at the
  IOTA interferometer","We describe the fringe packet tracking system used to equalise the optical
path lengths at the Infrared Optical Telescope Array (IOTA) interferometer. The
measurement of closure phases requires obtaining fringes on three baselines
simultaneously. This is accomplished using an algorithm based on double Fourier
interferometry for obtaining the wavelength-dependent phase of the fringes and
a group delay tracking algorithm for determining the position of the fringe
packet. The comparison between data acquired with and without the fringe packet
tracker shows about a factor 3 reduction of the error on the closure-phase
measurement. The fringe packet tracker has been able so far to track fringes of
signal-to-noise as low as 1.8 for stars as faint as mH=7.0.",2005-04-05T21:23:01Z
Which Massive stars are Gamma-Ray Burst Progenitors?,"The collapsar model for gamma-ray bursts requires three essential
ingredients: a massive core, removal of the hydrogen envelope, and enough
angular momentum in the core. We study current massive star evolution models of
solar metallicity to determine which massive star physics is capable of
producing these ingredients. In particular, we investigate the role of
hydrodynamic and magnetic internal angular momentum transport and binary mass
and angular momentum transfer. We follow the evolution of rotating single stars
and of binary systems that include rotational processes for both stars.
Neglecting magnetic fields, we show that the cores of massive single stars can
maintain a high specific angular momentum when evolved with the assumption that
mean molecular weight gradients suppress rotational mixing processes. In binary
systems that undergo mass transfer during core hydrogen burning the mass
receiving star accretes large amounts of high angular momentum material,
leading to a spin-up of the core. We find, however, that this merely
compensates for the tidal angular momentum loss due to spin-orbit coupling,
which leads to synchronous rotation before the mass transfer event. Therefore
the resulting cores do not rotate faster than in single stars. We also present
models that include magnetic fields generated by differential rotation and we
consider the internal angular momentum transport by magnetic torques. We
investigate the capability of magnetic torques to efficiently pump angular
momentum into the cores of accreting stars. Despite our finding that this
mechanism works, the magnetic coupling of core and envelope after the accreting
star ends core hydrogen burning leads to slower rotation than in the
non-magnetic case.",2005-04-07T10:43:51Z

Bimodal Color Distribution in Hierarchical Galaxy Formation,"We show how the observed bimodality in the color distribution of galaxies can
be explained in the framework of the hierarchical clustering picture in terms
of the interplay between the properties of the merging histories and the
feedback/star-formation processes in the progenitors of local galaxies. Using a
semi-analytic model of hierarchical galaxy formation, we compute the color
distributions of galaxies with different luminosities and compare them with the
observations. Our fiducial model matches the fundamental properties of the
observed distributions, namely: 1) the distribution of objects brighter than
M_r = -18 is clearly bimodal, with a fraction of red objects increasing with
luminosity; 2) for objects brighter than M_r = -21 the color distribution is
dominated by red objects with color u-r = 2.2-2.4; 3) the spread on the
distribution of the red population is smaller than that of the blue population;
4) the fraction of red galaxies is larger in denser environments, even for
low-luminosity objects; 5) the bimodality in the distribution persists up to z
= 1.5. We discuss the role of the different physical processes included in the
model in producing the above results.",2005-06-16T15:57:19Z
"On the effect of cyclotron emission on the spectral distortions of the
  cosmic microwave background","We have investigated the role of the cyclotron emission associated to cosmic
magnetic fields on the evolution of CMB spectral distortions by considering the
contributions by spontaneous and stimulated emission and by absorption in the
computation of the photon and energy injection rates. These cyclotron emission
rates have been numerically compared with those of the relevant radiative
processes operating in the cosmic plasma, bremsstrahlung and double Compton
scattering, for realistic CMB distorted spectra at early and late epochs. For
reasonable magnetic field strengths we find that the cyclotron emission
contribution is much smaller than the bremsstrahlung and double Compton
contributions, because of their different frequency locations and the high
bremsstrahlung and double Compton efficiency to keep the long wavelength region
of the CMB spectrum close to a blackbody (at electron temperature) during the
formation of the spectral distortion. Differently from previous analyses, we
find that for a very large set of dissipation mechanisms the role of cyclotron
emission in the evolution of CMB spectral distortions is negligible and, in
particular, it cannot re-establish a blackbody spectrum after the generation of
a realistic early distortion. The constraints on the energy exchanges at
various cosmic times can be then derived, under quite general assumptions, by
considering only Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung, and double Compton, other
than, obviously, the considered dissipation process. Finally, upper limits to
the CMB polarization degree induced by cyclotron emission have been estimated.",2005-05-12T14:58:47Z
"A Systematic Search for Gravitationally-Lensed Arcs in the Hubble Space
  Telescope WFPC2 Archive","We present the results of a systematic search for gravitationally-lensed arcs
in clusters of galaxies located in the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field and
Planetary Camera 2 data archive. By carefully examining the images of 128
clusters we have located 12 candidate radial arcs and 104 tangential arcs, each
of whose length to width ratio exceeds 7. In addition, 24 other radial arc
candidates were identified with a length to width ratio less than 7. Keck
spectroscopy of 17 candidate radial arcs suggests that contamination of the
radial arc sample from non-lensed objects is ~30-50%. With our catalog, we
explore the practicality of using the number ratio of radial to tangential arcs
as a statistical measure of the slope \beta of the dark matter distribution in
cluster cores (where \rho_{DM}\propto r^{-\beta} at small radii). Despite the
heterogeneous nature of the cluster sample, we demonstrate that this abundance
ratio is fairly constant across various cluster subsamples partitioned
according to X-ray luminosity and optical survey depth. We develop the
necessary formalism to interpret this ratio in the context of two-component
mass models for cluster cores. Although the arc statistics in our survey are
consistent with a range of density profiles -- \beta<~1.6 depending on various
assumptions, we show that one of the prime limiting factors is the distribution
of stellar masses for the brightest cluster galaxies. We discuss the prospects
for improving the observational constraints and thereby providing a reliable
statistical constraint on cluster dark matter profiles on <~100 kpc scales.",2005-02-24T22:40:05Z
"Long-term optical/IR variability of the Be/X-ray binary LS V +44 17/RX
  J0440.9+4431","We present the first long-term study of the optical counterpart to the X-ray
pulsar LS V +44 17/RX J0440.9+4431. The results of our photometric and
spectroscopic analysis show that LS V +44 17/RX J0440.9+4431 contains a
moderately reddened, E(B-V)=0.65+-0.05, B0.2V star located at about 3.3 kpc.
The Ha line consistently shows a double-peak profile varying from symmetric
shape to completely distorted on one side (V/R phases). A correlation between
the equivalent width of the Ha line and the infrared magnitudes is seen: as the
EW(Ha) decreases the IR magnitudes become fainter. This long-term optical/IR
variability is attributed to structural changes in the Be star's circumstellar
disc. The observations include a recent decline in the circumstellar disc and
subsequent recovery. We have witnessed the cessation of a global oscillation
due to the decline of the circumstellar disc. If the present disc growth rate
continues we predict the onset of another episode of V/R variability by the end
of 2006. We have investigated the typical time scales for disc variability of
various Be/X-ray binaries and found a correlation with the orbital period. This
correlation is hard to establish due to the difficulty in defining the exact
duration of the various activity states, but it is seen both in the duration of
the disc growth/dissipation phase and the value of the Ha equivalent width
prior to the appearance of asymmetric profiles. These relationships provide
further evidence for the interaction of the neutron star with the circumstellar
disc of the Be star's companion and confirms the need of a fully developed disc
for the V/R variability to be observed.",2005-06-10T12:16:20Z
Statistics of turbulence via polarimetry: alignment of grains and atoms,"Most astrophysical fluids are turbulent and magnetized. Fluctuations of
polarization provide a promising way to study astrophysical magnetic
turbulence. We discuss polarization that arises from grains and atoms aligned
in respect to magnetic field, describe the processes of alignment, explain when
the alignment reflects the direction of magnetic field. We show that temporal
fluctuations of interplanetary magnetic field can be studied using aligned
sodium atoms.",2005-05-29T00:18:20Z
The sensitivity of Lick indices to abundance variations,"We present results of model atmosphere/line formation calculations which
quantitatively test how the 21 classical and four higher-order Balmer-line
Lick/IDS indices (Worthey et al. 1994; Worthey & Ottaviani 1997) depend on
individual elemental abundances (of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, magnesium, iron,
calcium, natrium, silicon, chromium, titanium) and overall metallicity in
various stellar evolutionary stages and at various metallicities. At low
metallicities the effects of an overall enhancement of alpha-elements are also
investigated. The general results obtained by Tripicco & Bell (1995) at solar
metallicity are confirmed, while details do differ. Tables are given detailing
to which element every index reacts significantly, as a function of
evolutionary stage and composition.
  This work validates a number of assumptions implicitly made in the stellar
population models of Thomas, Maraston & Bender (2003), which utilized the
results of Tripicco & Bell (1995) to include the effects of element abundance
ratios variations. In particular, these computations confirm that fractional
changes to index strengths computed at solar metallicity (and solar age) can be
applied over a wide range of abundances and ages, also to model old stellar
populations with non-solar abundance ratios. The use of metallicity-dependent
response functions is, however, required for the proper modelling of the
Balmer-line indices. While H beta still responds only moderately to abundance
ratio variations, the higher-order Balmer indices H gamma and H delta display
very strong dependencies at high metallicities. As shown in Thomas, Maraston &
Korn (2004), this result allows to remove systematic effects in age
determinations based on different Balmer-line indices. (abridged)",2005-04-26T13:30:15Z
"A Spectroscopic Search for the non-nuclear Wolf-Rayet Population of the
  metal-rich spiral galaxy M83","We present a catalogue of non-nuclear regions containing Wolf-Rayet stars in
the metal-rich spiral galaxy M83 (NGC5236). From a total of 283 candidate
regions identified using HeII 4686 imaging with VLT-FORS2, Multi Object
Spectroscopy of 198 regions was carried out, confirming 132 WR sources. From
this sub-sample, an exceptional content of 1035 +/- 300 WR stars is inferred,
with N(WC)/N(WN) approx 1.2, continuing the trend to larger values at higher
metallicity amongst Local Group galaxies, and greatly exceeding current
evolutionary predictions at high metallicity. Late-type stars dominate the WC
population of M83, with N(WC8-9)/N(WC4-7)=9 and WO subtypes absent, consistent
with metallicity dependent WC winds. Equal numbers of late to early WN stars
are observed, again in contrast to current evolutionary predictions. Several
sources contain large numbers of WR stars. In particular, #74 (alias region 35
from De Vaucouleurs et al. contains 230 WR stars, and is identified as a Super
Star Cluster from inspection of archival HST/ACS images. Omitting this
starburst cluster would result in revised statistics of N(WC)/N(WN) approx 1
and N(WC8-9)/N(WC4-7) approx 6 for the `quiescent' disk population. Including
recent results for the nucleus and accounting for incompleteness in our
spectroscopic sample, we suspect the total WR population of M83 may exceed 3000
stars.",2005-06-15T13:55:51Z
"Dust Penetrated Arm Classes: Insights from rising and falling rotation
  curves","In the last decade, near-infrared imaging has highlighted the decoupling of
gaseous and old stellar disks: the morphologies of optical (Population I)
tracers compared to the old stellar disk morphology, can be radically
different. Galaxies which appear multi-armed and even flocculent in the optical
may show significant Grand-Design spirals in the near-infrared. Furthermore,
the optically determined Hubble classification scheme does not provide a sound
way of classifying dust-penetrated stellar disks: spiral arm pitch angles (when
measured in the near-infrared) do not correlate with Hubble type. The
dust--penetrated classification scheme of Block & Puerari provides an
alternative classification based on near-infrared morphology, and which is thus
more closely linked to the dominant stellar mass component. Here we present
near--infrared K band images of 14 galaxies, on which we have performed a
Fourier analysis of the spiral structure in order to determine their
near-infrared pitch angles and dust--penetrated arm classes. We have also used
the rotation curve data of Mathewson et al. to calculate the rates of shear in
the stellar disks of these galaxies. We find a correlation between
near-infrared pitch angle and rate of shear: galaxies with wide open arms (the
$\gamma$ class) are found to have rising rotation curves, while those with
falling rotation curves belong to the tightly wound $\alpha$ bin. The major
determinant of near-infrared spiral arm pitch angle is the distribution of
matter within the galaxy concerned. The correlation reported in this study
provides the physical basis underpinning spiral arm classes in the
dust-penetrated regime and underscores earlier spectroscopic findings by
Burstein and Rubin that Hubble type and mass distributions are unrelated.",2005-02-28T20:06:01Z
"Upper limits on gravitational waves emission in association with the Dec

detector was on the air with a noise performance close to stationary gaussian.
This allows to set relevant upper limits, at a number of frequencies in the
vicinities of 900 Hz, on the amplitude of the damped gw wave trains, which,
according to current models, could have been emitted, due to the excitation of
normal modes of the star associated with the peak in X-rays luminosity.",2005-06-07T12:21:56Z
"Flux and field line conservation in 3--D nonideal MHD flows: Remarks
  about criteria for 3--D reconnection without magnetic neutral points","We make some remarks on reconnection in plasmas and want to present some
calculations related to the problem of finding velocity fields which conserve
magnetic flux or at least magnetic field lines. Hereby we start from views and
definitions of ideal and non-ideal flows on one hand, and of reconnective and
non-reconnective plasma dynamics on the other hand. Our considerations give
additional insights into the discussion on violations of the frozen--in field
concept which started recently with the papers by Baranov & Fahr (2003a;
2003b). We find a correlation between the nonidealness which is given by a
generalized form of the Ohm's law and a general transporting velocity, which is
field line conserving.",2005-05-27T12:33:00Z
The cooling function of HD molecule revisited,"We report new calculations of the cooling rate of primordial gas by the HD
molecule, taking into account its ro-vibrational structure. The HD cooling
function is calculated including radiative and collisional transitions for
J\le8 rotational levels, and for the vibrational levels v=0,1,2 and 3. The
ro-vibrational level population is calculated from the balance equation
assuming steady state. The cooling function is evaluated in the ranges of the
kinetic temperatures, T_k, from 1e2 to 2e4 K and the number densities, n_H,
from 1 to 1e8 cm**-3. We find that the inclusion of collisional ro-vibrational
transitions increases significantly the HD cooling efficiency, in particular
for high densities and temperatures. For n_H>~1e5 and T_k~1e4 K the cooling
function becomes more than an order of magnitude higher than previously
reported. We give also the HD cooling rate in the presence of the cosmic
microwave radiation field for radiation temperatures of 30, 85 and 275 K
(redshifts of 9, 29 and 99). The tabulated cooling functions are available at
http://www.cifus.uson.mx/Personal\_Pages/anton/DATA/HD\_cooling/HD\_cool.html.
We discuss the relevance to explore the effects of including our results into
models and simulations of galaxy formation, especially in the regime when gas
cools down from temperatures above ~3000 K.",2005-03-31T00:49:58Z
"The Cusp/Core Problem in Galactic Halos: Long-Slit Spectra for a Large
  Dwarf Galaxy Sample","We derive inner dark matter halo density profiles for a sample of 165
low-mass galaxies using rotation curves obtained from high-quality, long-slit
optical spectra assuming minimal disks and spherical symmetry. For $\rho(r)
\sim r^{-\alpha}$ near the galaxy center we measure median inner slopes ranging
from $\alpha_m = 0.22 \pm 0.08$ to $0.28 \pm 0.06$ for various subsamples of
the data. This is similar to values found by other authors, and in stark
contrast to the intrinsic cusps ($\alpha_{int}\sim1$) predicted by simulations
of halo assembly in cold dark matter (CDM) cosmologies. To elucidate the
relationship between $\alpha_m$ and $\alpha_{int}$ in our data, we simulate
long-slit observations of model galaxies with halo shapes broadly consistent
with the CDM paradigm. Simulations with $\alpha_{int}=1/2$ and 1 recover both
the observed distribution of $\alpha_m$ and correlations between $\alpha_m$ and
primary observational parameters such as distance and disk inclination, whereas
those with $\alpha_{int}=5/4$ are marginally consistent with the data.
Conversely, the hypothesis that low-mass galaxies have $\alpha_{int}=3/2$ is
rejected. While the simulations do not imply that the data favor intrinsic
cusps over cores, they demonstrate that the discrepancy between $\alpha_m$ and
$\alpha_{int}\sim1$ for our sample does not necessarily imply a genuine
conflict between our results and CDM predictions: rather, the apparent
cusp/core problem may be reconciled by considering the impact of observing and
data processing techniques on rotation curves derived from long-slit spectra.",2005-02-08T17:08:52Z
"The Low End of the Supermassive Black Hole Mass Function: Constraining
  the Mass of a Nuclear Black Hole in NGC 205 via Stellar Kinematics","Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images and spectra of the nucleated dwarf
elliptical galaxy NGC 205 are combined with 3-integral axisymmetric dynamical
models to constrain the mass (M_BH) of a putative nuclear black hole. This is
only the second attempt, after M33, to use resolved stellar kinematics to
search for a nuclear black hole with mass below 10^6 solar masses. We are
unable to identify a best-fit value of M_BH in NGC 205; however, the data
impose a upper limit of 2.2x10^4 M_sun (1sigma confidence) and and upper limit
of 3.8x10^4 M_sun (3sigma confidence). This upper limit is consistent with the
extrapolation of the M_BH-sigma relation to the M_BH < 10^6 M_sunregime. If we
assume that NGC 205 and M33 both contain nuclear black holes, the upper limits
on M_BH in the two galaxies imply a slope of ~5.5 or greater for the M_BH-sigma
relation. We use our 3-integral models to evaluate the relaxation time (T_r)
and stellar collision time (T_coll) in NGC 205; T_r~10^8 yr or less in the
nucleus and T_coll~10^11 yr. The low value of T_r is consistent with core
collapse having already occurred, but we are unable to draw conclusions from
nuclear morphology about the presence or absence of a massive black hole.",2005-02-23T20:15:38Z
Mira Variables in the OGLE Bulge fields,"(abridged) The 222000 I-band light curves of variable stars detected by the
OGLE-II survey in the direction of the Galactic Bulge have been fitted and have
also been correlated with the DENIS and 2MASS databases. Results are presented
for 2691 objects with I-band semi-amplitude larger than 0.45 magnitude,
corresponding to classical Mira variables. The Mira period distribution of 6
fields at similar longitude but spanning latitudes from -1.2 to -5.8 degrees
are statistically indistinguisable indicating similar populations with initial
masses of 1.5-2 \msol (corresponding to ages of 1-3 Gyr). A field at similar
longitude at b = -0.05 from Glass et al. (2001) does show a significantly
different period distribution, indicating the presence of a younger population
of 2.5-3 \msol and ages below 1 Gyr. The K-band period-luminosity relation is
presented for the whole sample, and for sub-fields. The zero point depends on
Galactic longitude. Simulations are carried out to show that the observed
dependence of the zero point with $l$, and the number of stars per field are
naturally explained using the model of disk and bulge stars of Binney et al.
(1997), for a viewing angle of 43 +/- 17 degrees. A comparison is made with
similar objects in the Magellanic Clouds, studied in a previous paper. The
slope of the PL-relation in the Bulge and the MCs agree within the errorbars. A
distance to the Galactic Centre between 8.6 and 9.0 kpc is derived (for an
assumed DM of 18.50 to the LMC).",2005-06-15T09:46:39Z
A fossil origin for the magnetic fields of A-stars and white dwarfs,"Some main-sequence stars of spectral type A are observed to have a strong
(300-30000 G), static, large-scale magnetic field, of a chiefly dipolar shape
-- the `Ap stars' (for example Alioth, the fifth star in the Big Dipper).
Following their discovery fifty years ago, it was speculated that these fields
a remnants of the star's formation, a `fossil' field. Alternatively, they could
be generated by a dynamo process in the star's convective core. The dynamo
hypothesis has difficulty explaining high field strengths and the lack of a
correlation with rotation. The weakness of the fossil-field theory has been the
absence of known field configurations stable enough to survive in a star over
its lifetime. We demonstrate here the formation of stable magnetic field
configurations, with properties agreeing with those observed, by evolution from
arbitrary, unstable initial fields. The results are applicable equally to Ap
stars, magnetic white dwarfs and some highly magnetised neutron stars known as
magnetars. This establishes fossil fields as the natural, unifying explanation
for the magnetism of all these stars.",2005-02-02T16:13:33Z
Dark Energy Condensation,"The two most popular candidates for dark energy, i.e. a cosmological constant
and quintessence, are very difficult to distinguish observationally, mostly
because the quintessence field does not have sizable fluctuations. We study a
scalar field model for dark energy in which the scalar field is invariant under
reflection symmetry, phi -> -phi. Under general assumptions, there is a phase
transition at late times (z < 0.5). Before the phase transition, the field
behaves as a cosmological constant. After the phase transition, a
time-dependent scalar condensate forms, the field couples with dark matter and
develops sizable perturbations tracking those of dark matter. The background
cosmological evolution is in agreement with existing observations, but might be
distinguished from that of a cosmological constant by future Supernovae
surveys. The growth of cosmological perturbations carries the imprint of the
phase transition, however a non-linear approach has to be developed in order to
study it quantitatively.",2005-05-31T10:05:55Z
Infrared Observations of Neutron-Capture Elements in Planetary Nebulae,"We present results from an ongoing survey of the infrared emission lines [Kr
III] 2.199 and [Se IV] 2.287 micron in Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe).
Krypton and selenium may be produced by slow neutron-capture nucleosynthesis
(the ``s-process'') during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase of PN
progenitor stars, and brought to the surface by convective dredge-up before PN
ejection. We detect emission from Se and Kr in 65 of 114 Galactic PNe, and use
the line fluxes to derive ionic abundances. We employ ionization correction
factors based on coincidences of ionization potentials to calculate total
elemental abundances, and discuss photoionization models designed to test the
veracity of these corrections. The derived Se and Kr abundances of our targets
range from approximately solar to enriched by a factor of 5, which indicates
varying degrees of dredge-up and s-process efficiencies in the progenitor
stars. In PNe exhibiting emission from both Se and Kr, we find that the
relative abundances of these elements are generally in agreement with
predictions from theoretical models of s-process nucleosynthesis. We examine
our results for correlations between s-process enrichments and other nebular
properties, such as CNO abundances, morphology, and characteristics of the
central stars. PNe with Wolf-Rayet central stars tend to exhibit more elevated
Se and Kr abundances than other nebulae. Bipolar nebulae, believed to arise
from the most massive of PN progenitors, may have lower n-capture abundances
than elliptical PNe.",2005-06-10T20:05:21Z
"The depolarisation properties of powerful extragalactic radio sources as
  a function of cosmic epoch","We use the observed polarisation properties of a sample of 26 powerful radio
galaxies and radio-loud quasars to constrain the conditions in the Faraday
screens local to the sources. We adopt the cosmological redshift, low-frequency
radio luminosity and physical size of the large-scale radio structures as our
`fundamental' parameters. We find no correlation of the radio spectral index
with any of the fundamental parameters. The observed rotation measure is also
independent of these parameters. The difference between the rotation measures
of the two lobes of an individual source as well as the dispersion of the
rotation measure show significant correlations with the source redshift, but
not with the radio luminosity or source size. Thus the small-scale structure
observed in the rotation measure is caused by a Faraday screen local to the
sources. The observed asymmetries between the lobes of our sources show no
significant trends with each other or other source properties. Finally, we show
that the commonly used model for the depolarisation of synchrotron radio
emission by foreground Faraday screens is inconsistent with our observations.
We apply alternative models to our data and show that they require a strong
increase of the dispersion of the rotation measure inside the Faraday screens
with cosmological redshift. Correcting our observations with these models for
redshift effects, we find a strong correlation of the depolarisation measure
with redshift and a significantly weaker correlation with radio luminosity. All
our results are consistent with a decrease in the order of the magnetic field
structure of the Faraday screen local to the sources for increasing
cosmological redshift. (abridged)",2005-03-08T15:40:26Z
"An Extended Grid of Nova Models: II. The Parameter Space of Nova
  Outbursts","This paper is a sequel to an earlier paper devoted to multiple, multicycle
nova evolution models (Prialnik & Kovetz 1995, first paper of the series),
which showed that the different characteristics of nova outbursts can be
reproduced by varying the values of three basic and independent parameters: the
white dwarf mass-M_{WD}, the temperature of its isothermal core-T_{WD} and the
mass transfer rate-Mdot. Apart from being the largest computational classical
novae parameter-space survey, we show here that the parameter space is
constrained by several analytical considerations and find its limiting
surfaces. Consequently, we extend the grid of multicycle nova evolution models
presented in Paper I almost to its limits, adding multicycle nova outburst
calculations for a considerable number of new parameter combinations. In
particular, the extended parameter pace that produces nova eruptions includes
low mass transfer rates down to 5e-13 Msun/yr, and more models for low T_{WD}.
Resulting characteristics of these runs are added to the former parameter
combination results, to provide a full grid spanning the entire parameter space
for Carbon-Oxygen white dwarfs. The full grid covers the entire range of
observed nova characteristics, even those of peculiar objects, which have not
been numerically reproduced until now. Most remarkably, runs for very low Mdot
lead to very high values for some characteristics, such as outburst amplitude
A>~20, high super-Eddington luminosities at maximum, heavy element abundance of
the ejecta Z_{ej}~0.63 and high ejected masses m_{ej}~7e-4 Msun.",2005-03-07T13:15:52Z
Old Globular Clusters Masquerading as Young in NGC 4365?,"High signal-to-noise, low-resolution spectra have been obtained for 22
globular clusters (GCs) in NGC 4365. Some of these were selected as probable
representatives of an intermediate-age (2-5 Gyr), extremely metal-rich GC
subpopulation. The presence of such a subpopulation had been inferred from the
unusual optical and near-IR color distributions of GCs in this otherwise
typical Virgo elliptical galaxy. However, ages derived from Lick indices are
consistent with uniformly old mean ages for all GCs in our sample. The
metallicities of the clusters show some evidence for a trimodal distribution.
The most metal-poor and metal-rich peaks are consistent with the values
expected for an elliptical galaxy of this luminosity, but there appears to be
an additional, intermediate-metallicity peak lying between them. New Hubble
Space Telescope photometry is consistent with this result. A plausible scenario
is that in earlier data these three peaks merged into a single broad
distribution. Our results suggest that it is difficult to identify
intermediate-age GC subpopulations solely with photometry, even when both
optical and near-infrared colors are used.",2005-02-22T21:05:14Z
"The Configuration of Fraternite-Egalite2-Egalite1 in the Neptune Ring
  Arcs System","By considering the finite mass of Fraternite, although small, it is shown
that there are two time averaged stationary points in its neighborhood due to
the reaction of the test body to the fields of Neptune, Galatea, and
Fraternite. These two locations measuring 11.7 and 13.8 degrees from the center
of Fraternite could correspond to the locations of Egalite 2 and Egalite 1.
This model accounts for the 10 degree span of Fraternite and estimates its mass
at $m_{f}=6.4\times 10^{16}$ Kg. The eccentricities of Egalite 2 and Egalite 1
are believed to be about $e=5\times 10^{-4}$.",2005-03-02T17:12:41Z
Sulphur chemistry and molecular shocks: the case of NGC1333-IRAS2,"We present SO and SO2 observations in the region of the low mass protostar
IRAS2/NGC1333. The East-West outflow originating from this source has been
mapped in four transitions of both SO and SO2. In addition, CS observations
published in the literature have been used. We compute the SO, SO2 and CS
column densities and the physical conditions at several positions of the
outflow using LTE and a non-LTE LVG approximations. The SO2/SO and CS/SO
abundance ratios are compared with the theoretical predictions of a chemical
model adapted to the physical conditions in the IRAS2 outflow. The SO2/SO
abundance ratios are constant in the two lobes of the outflow whereas CS/SO is
up to 6 times lower in the shocked gas of the East lobe than in the West one.
The comparison with the chemical model allows us to constrain the age of the
outflow produced by IRAS2 to >5e3yr. We find low densities and temperatures for
the outflow of IRAS2 (< 1e6 cm-3 and >70 K) from SO and SO2 emission probably
because the two molecules trace the cooled entrained material. The East lobe of
the outflow shows denser gas compared to the West lobe. We also discuss some
constraints on the depleted form of sulphur.",2005-03-22T20:55:13Z
"Constraints on Intracluster Gas Bulk Motions in Clusters of Galaxies
  with ASCA","The recent detection of Doppler shifts of X-ray spectral lines in the
intracluster gas of the Centaurus and Perseus clusters of galaxies with ASCA
has raised the question of the frequency of such velocity gradients and their
relation to other cluster properties. To address this and improve the sample of
ICM velocity gradient candidates we carried out a systematic search of the ASCA
archive for clusters with suitable observing conditions that allow full
azimuthal mapping of gas velocities near the central regions. Here we present
the results of the azimuthal velocity distribution of a sample consisting of
the best"" observed clusters for velocity analysis. Our sample encompasses
clusters with different physical and morphological characteristics, including
both well behaved ""cooling flow"" and dynamically active clusters. The gas
temperatures of the clusters in our sample range from 1.4 keV to 6.3 keV. We
find velocity substructures in ~ 15% of the clusters in our sample on the order
of a few x 1E3 km/s. The significance of the velocity gradients' is greater
than 99% in Abell 576 and RXJ0419.6+0225, the clusters where velocity gradients
are most significant. The velocity gradients are consistent with transitory
and/or rotational bulk motion. The velocity gradients in these clusters are
unlikely to be due to projected temperature anisotropies, ASCA PSF, intrachip
gain variations, and flux contamination from other sources. Chandra images of
these clusters do not show obvious cluster alignments within the field of view
covered by ASCA. We also noticed a high frequency (~50%) of anisotropic
temperature gradients in the core of ""cooling flow"" clusters, suggesting the
presence of frequent dynamical activity in the core of galaxy clusters.",2005-06-15T23:36:08Z
"Near Infrared Surface Properties of the Two Intrinsically Brightest
  Minor Planets (90377) Sedna and (90482) Orcus","We present low resolution K band spectra taken at the Gemini 8 meter
telescope of (90377) Sedna and (90482) Orcus (provisional designations 2003
VB12 and 2004 DW, respectively), currently the two minor planets with the
greatest absolute magnitudes (i.e. the two most reflective minor planets). We
place crude limits on the surface composition of these two bodies using a Hapke
model for a wide variety of assumed albedos. The unusual minor planet (90377)
Sedna was discovered on November 14, 2003 UT at roughly 90 AU with 1.6 times
the heliocentric distance and perihelion distance of any other bound minor
planet. It is the first solar system object discovered between the Kuiper Belt
and the Oort Cloud, and may represent a transition population between the two.
The reflectance spectrum of (90377) Sedna appears largely featureless at the
current signal-to-noise ratio, suggesting a surface likely to be highly
processed by cosmic rays. For large grain models (100 micron to 1 cm) we find
that (90377) Sedna must have less than 70% surface fraction of water ice and
less than 60% surface fraction of methane ice to 3 sigma confidence. Minor
planet (90482) Orcus shows strong water ice absorption corresponding to less
than 50% surface fraction for grain models 25 micron and larger. Orcus cannot
have more than 30% of its surface covered by large (100 mm to 1 cm) methane
grains to 3 sigma confidence.",2005-04-12T20:00:27Z
"Central Blue Clumps in Elliptical Galaxies of the Hubble Ultra Deep
  Field","Elliptical galaxies larger than 10 pixels in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field
(UDF) were surveyed for internal structure; 30 out of 100 in a sample of 884
morphologically classified galaxies exhibit large blue clumps near their
centers. Unsharp-masked images of the best cases are presented. The
distributions of the clumps on color-color and color-magnitude diagrams are
about the same as the distributions of isolated objects in the UDF field with
the same size, suggesting a possible accretion origin. In the few cases where
redshifts are published, the clump masses and star-formation ages were
determined from stellar evolution models, as were the galaxy masses. The clump
mass scales with galaxy mass, probably because of selection effects, and ranges
from 10^6 Msun to 10^8 Msun for galaxies with masses from 10^{9} Msun to
10^{11} Msun. The clump star formation age ranges between 10^7 yr and 2x10^8
yr. With partial evaporation and core contraction in the intervening years,
some of these clumps could resemble globular clusters today. Stars that
evaporate will contribute to the field population in the elliptical galaxy.",2005-04-01T18:33:09Z
The Herbig Ae star HD 163296 in X-rays,"Chandra X-ray imaging spectroscopy of the nearby Herbig Ae star HD 163296 at
100 AU angular resolution is reported. A point-like, soft (kT~0.5 keV),
emission-line source is detected at the location of the star with an X-ray
luminosity of 4.0e29 erg/s. In addition, faint emission along the direction of
a previously-detected Ly-alpha-emitting jet and Herbig-Haro outflow may be
present. The relatively low luminosity, lack of a hard spectral component, and
absence of strong X-ray variability in HD 163296 can be explained as
originating from optically-thin shock-heated gas accreting onto the stellar
surface along magnetic field lines. This would require a (dipole) magnetic
field strength at the surface of HD 163296 of at least ~100 G and perhaps as
high as several kG. HD 163296 joins the T Tauri star TW Hya in being the only
examples known to date of pre-main-sequence stars whose quiescent X-ray
emission appears to be completely dominated by accretion.",2005-03-03T14:37:52Z
"Measurement of the Shadowing of High-Energy Cosmic Rays by the Moon: A
  Search for TeV-Energy Antiprotons","The shadowing of high-energy cosmic rays by the Moon has been observed with a
significance of 9.4 standard deviations with the L3+C muon spectrometer at
CERN. A significant effect of the Earth magnetic field is observed. Since no
event deficit on the east side of the Moon has been observed, an upper limit at
90% confidence level on the antiproton to proton ratio of 0.11 is obtained for
primary energies around 1 TeV.",2005-03-22T13:38:19Z
New Jupiter and Saturn formation models meet observations,"The wealth of observational data about Jupiter and Saturn provides strong
constraints to guide our understanding of the formation of giant planets. The
size of the core and the total amount of heavy elements in the envelope have
been derived from internal structure studies by Saumon & Guillot (2004). The
atmospheric abundance of some volatile elements has been measured {\it in situ}
by the {\it Galileo} probe (Mahaffy et al. 2000, Wong et al. 2004) or by remote
sensing (Briggs & Sackett 1989, Kerola et al. 1997). In this Letter, we show
that, by extending the standard core accretion formation scenario of giant
planets by Pollack et al. (1996) to include migration and protoplanetary disk
evolution, it is possible to account for all of these constraints in a
self-consistent manner.",2005-04-27T12:16:13Z
Photometric observations from theoretical flip-flop models,"Some active stars show a so-called flip-flop phenomenon in which the main
spot activity periodically switches between two active longitudes that are 180
degrees apart. In this paper we study the flip-flop phenomenon by converting
results from dynamo calculations into long-term synthetic photometric
observations, which are then compared to the real stellar observations. We show
that similar activity patterns as obtained from flip-flop dynamo calculations,
can also be seen in the observations. The long-term light-curve behaviour seen
in the synthesised data can be used for finding new stars exhibiting the
flip-flop phenomenon.",2005-06-13T10:26:24Z
"Observational Signature of Tidal Disruption of a Star by a Massive Black
  Hole","We have modeled the time-variable profiles of the Balmer alpha emission from
the nonaxisymmetric disk and debris tail created in the tidal disruption of a
solar-type star by a million solar mass black hole. Two tidal disruption events
were simulated using a three dimensional relativistic smoothed particle
hydrodynamic code to describe the early evolution of the debris during the
first 50-90 days. We have calculated the physical conditions and radiative
processes in the debris using the photoionization code CLOUDY. We model the
emission-line profiles in the period immediately after the accretion rate onto
the black hole becomes significant. We find that the line profiles at these
very early stages of the evolution of the postdisruption debris do not resemble
the double-peaked profiles expected from a rotating disk, since the debris has
not yet settled into such a stable structure. As a result of the uneven
distribution of the debris and the existence of a ``tidal tail'' (the stream of
returning debris), the line profiles depend sensitively on the orientation of
the tail relative to the line of sight. Moreover, the predicted line profiles
vary on fairly short time scales (of order hours to days). Given the accretion
rate onto the black hole we also model the Balmer alpha light curve from the
debris.",2005-05-13T22:04:08Z
"Mixed-phase induced core-quakes and the changes in neutron star
  parameters","We present approximate formulae describing the changes in neutron star
parameters caused by the first-order phase transition to an ``exotic'' state
(pion or kaon condensate, quark matter) resulting in formation of a mixed-phase
core. The analytical formulae for the changes in radius, moment of inertia and
the amount of energy released during the core-quake are derived using the
theory of linear response of stellar structure to the core transformation.
Numerical coefficients in these formulae are obtained for two realistic EOSs of
dense matter. The problem of nucleation of the exotic phase as well as possible
astrophysical scenarios leading to a core-quake phenomenon is also discussed.",2005-02-17T13:48:08Z
Multi-periodic oscillations of alpha Hya,"We report the detection of multi-periodic oscillations of the cool evolved
star alpha Hya (HD 81797, K3II-III). Two-hundred and forty-three
high-resolution spectra (R=48,000) of this star have been obtained in March and
April 2005 with FEROS at the 2.2 m-MPG/ESO telescope in La Silla Observatory,
Chile. We observed oscillations in the stellar radial velocity and the
asymmetry of the spectral line profile. We detected oscillation frequencies of
the stellar radial velocity in two frequency regions, nu= 2-30 muHz and nu=
50-120 muHz. The corresponding periods are P= 0.6-5.6 days and P= 2.3-5.5
hours, respectively. In addition to these oscillations we also observed a trend
in the radial velocity which shows evidence for a long-term variability.
Furthermore, our measurements show a correlation between the variation in the
radial velocity and the asymmetry of the spectral line profile, as measured in
the bisector velocity spans. The line bisectors also show oscillations in the
same frequency regions as those of the radial velocity. We identified 13
oscillation frequencies in the bisector variation with equidistant separations
of 8.09 +- 0.32 muHz in the lower frequency region and 7.69 +- 0.47 muHz in the
higher frequency region. The source of the short-term oscillations of alpha Hya
is obviously due to non-radial stellar pulsations. These oscillations may have
a similar origin like oscillations in solar-like stars. The detection of the
multi-periodic oscillations in alpha-Hya makes this star to be an amenable
target for asteroseismology, in particular, as it is a star in the red giant
branch.",2005-05-10T13:17:31Z
"CMB Polarimetry using Correlation Receivers with the PIQUE and CAPMAP
  Experiments","The Princeton IQU Experiment (PIQUE) and the Cosmic Anisotropy Polarization
MAPper (CAPMAP) are experiments designed to measure the polarization of the
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) on sub-degree scales in an area within 1
degree of the North Celestial Pole using heterodyne correlation polarimeters
and off-axis telescopes located in central New Jersey. PIQUE produced the
tightest limit on the CMB polarization prior to its detection by DASI, while
CAPMAP has recently detected polarization at l~1000. The experimental methods

Anisotropic mass ejection in binary mergers,"We investigate the mass loss from a rotationally distorted envelope following
the early, rapid in-spiral of a companion star inside a common envelope. For
initially wide, massive binaries (M_1+M_2=20M_{\odot}, P\sim 10 yr), the
primary has a convective envelope at the onset of mass transfer and is able to
store much of the available orbital angular momentum in its expanded envelope.
Three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics calculations show that mass
loss is enhanced at mid-latitudes due to shock reflection from a torus-shaped
outer envelope. Mass ejection in the equatorial plane is completely suppressed
if the shock wave is too weak to penetrate the outer envelope in the equatorial
direction (typically when the energy deposited in the star is less than about
one-third of the binding energy of the envelope). We present a parameter study
to show how the geometry of the ejecta depends on the angular momentum and the
energy deposited in the envelope during a merging event. Applications to the
nearly axisymmetric, but very non-spherical nebulae around SN1987A and Sheridan
25 are discussed, as well as possible links to RY Scuti and the Small
Magellanic Cloud object R4.",2005-02-15T11:26:20Z
"The HIPASS catalogue: Omega_HI and environmental effects on the HI mass
  function of galaxies","We use the catalogue of 4315 extragalactic HI 21-cm emission line detections
from HIPASS to calculate the most accurate measurement of the HI mass function
(HIMF) of galaxies to date. The completeness of the HIPASS sample is well
characterised, which enables an accurate calculation of space densities. The
HIMF is fitted with a Schechter function with parameters: alpha=-1.37 +/- 0.03
+/- 0.05, log (M_HI/M_sun=9.80 +/- 0.03 +/- 0.03, and theta*=(6.0 +/- 0.8 +/-
0.6) x 10^{-3} Mpc^{-3} (random and systematic uncertainties at 68% CL, H0=75),
in good agreement with calculations based on the HIPASS Bright Galaxy
Catalogue, which is a complete, but smaller, sub-sample of galaxies. The
cosmological mass density of HI in the local universe is found to be
Omega_HI=(3.5 +/- 0.4 +/- 0.4) x 10^{-4}. This large homogeneous sample allows
us to test whether the shape of the HIMF depends on local galaxy density. We
find tentative evidence for environmental effects in the sense that the HIMF
becomes steeper toward higher density regions, ranging from alpha ~ -1.2 in the
lowest density environments to alpha ~ -1.5 in the highest density environments
probed by this blind HI survey. This effect appears stronger when densities are
measured on larger scales.",2005-02-13T21:59:26Z

Two Windows on Acceleration and Gravitation: Dark Energy or New Gravity?,"Small distortions in the observed shapes of distant galaxies, a cosmic shear
due to gravitational lensing, can be used to simultaneously determine the

Both of these functions are sensitive probes of the acceleration. Their
simultaneous determination allows for a consistency test and provides
sensitivity to physics beyond the standard dark energy paradigm.",2005-03-30T06:09:13Z
"Metal abundances in extremely distant Galactic old open clusters. II.
  Berkeley 22 and Berkeley 66","We report on high resolution spectroscopy of four giant stars in the Galactic
old open clusters Berkeley~22 and Berkeley~66 obtained with HIRES at the Keck
telescope. We find that $[Fe/H]=-0.32\pm0.19$ and $[Fe/H]=-0.48\pm0.24$ for
Berkeley~22 and Berkeley~66, respectively. Based on these data, we first revise
the fundamental parameters of the clusters, and then discuss them in the
context of the Galactic disk radial abundance gradient. We found that both
clusters nicely obey the most updated estimate of the slope of the gradient
from \citet{fri02} and are genuine Galactic disk objects.",2005-04-13T14:06:09Z
"Spherical Gravitational Collapse of Annihilating Dark Matter and the
  Minimum Mass of CDM Black Holes","Spherical gravitational collapse of a cold gas of annihilating particles
involves a competition between the free-fall rate $\propto\sqrt{\rho}$ and the
(s-wave) annihilation rate $\propto\rho$. Thus, there is a critical density
$\rhoann$ above which annihilation proceeds faster than free fall.
Gravitational collapse of a cloud of (initial) mass $M$ to a black hole is only
possible if $3/32\pi G^3M^2\lesssim\rhoann$, or $M\gtrsim\Mann\equiv (3/32\pi
G^3\rhoann)^{1/2}$. For a particle mass $m$ and freeze-out temperature
$T_f=m/x_f$, the minimum black hole mass is $\Mann\approx 10^{10}\msun
\times(x_f\sqrt{g_\star}/100\omcdm g_{\star S}m({\rm Gev}))$, where $g_{\star
S}$ and $g_\star$ are degeneracy factors. The formation of a black hole of
initial mass $M_{BH}$ is accompanied by the annihilation of about $M_{ann}$
released in a burst lasting a time $\sim GM_{BH}$ that could reach a total
annihilation luminosity $\sim 10^{59} {\rm erg s^{-1}}$. The absence of
astronomical observations of such spectacular events suggests either: (i) the
branching ratio for CDM annihilation to $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs or quarks $\lesssim
10^{-10}$, while the branching ratio to $\nu{\bar{\nu}}$ is $\lesssim 10^{-5}$;
or (ii) CDM is not made of annihilating particles, but may be in some
non-annihilating form, such as axions; or (iii) CDM black holes never form.",2005-05-25T14:14:13Z
Rapid Growth of Black Holes in Massive Star-Forming Galaxies,"The tight relationship between the masses of black holes and galaxy spheroids
in nearby galaxies implies a causal connection between the growth of these two
components. Optically luminous quasars host the most prodigious accreting black
holes in the Universe and can account for >30% of the total cosmological
black-hole growth. As typical quasars are not, however, undergoing intense star
formation and already host massive black holes [>10^(8) M(Sun)], there must
have been an earlier pre-quasar phase when these black holes grew [mass range
  ~10^(6)-10^(8) M(Sun)]. The likely signature of this earlier stage is
simultaneous black-hole growth and star formation in distant (i.e., z>1; >8
billion light years away) luminous galaxies. Here we report ultra-deep X-ray
observations of distant star-forming galaxies that are bright at submillimetre
wavelengths. We find that the black holes in these galaxies are growing almost
continuously throughout periods of intense star formation. This activity
appears to be more tightly associated with these galaxies than any other coeval
galaxy populations. We show that the black-hole growth from these galaxies is
consistent with that expected for the pre-quasar phase.",2005-03-21T21:12:46Z
A Supernova Factory in Mrk 273?,"We report on 1.6 and 5.0 GHz observations of the ultraluminous infrared
galaxy (ULIRG) Mrk 273, using the European VLBI Network (EVN) and the
Multi-Element Radio-Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN). We also make use of
published 1.4 GHz VLBA observations of Mrk 273 by Carilli & Taylor (2000). Our
5 GHz images have a maximum resolution of 5-10 mas, which corresponds to linear
resolutions of 3.5-7 pc at the distance of Mrk 273, and are the most sensitive
high-resolution radio observations yet made of this ULIRG. Component N1, often
pinpointed as a possible AGN, displays a steep spectral index ($\alpha = 1.2
\pm 0.1; S_\nu \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$); hence it is very difficult to reconcile
with N1 being an AGN, and rather suggests that the compact nonthermal radio
emission is produced by an extremely high luminous individual radio supernova
(RSN), or a combination of unresolved emission from nested supernova remnants
(SNR), luminous RSNe, or both. Component N2 is partly resolved out into several
compact radio sources --none of which clearly dominates-- and a region of
extended emission about 30 pc in size. The integrated spectral index of this
region is flat ($\alpha = 0.15 \pm 0.1$), which can be interpreted as due to a
superposition of several unresolved components, e.g., RSNe or SNRs, whose radio
emission peaks at different frequencies and is partially free-free absorbed.
The overall extended radio emission from component N is typical of nonthermal,
optically thin radio emission ($\alpha = 0.8 \pm 0.1$), and its 1.4 GHz
luminosity ($L_{1.4 \rm GHz} = (2.2 \pm 0.1)\times 10^{23} $ WHz$^{-1}$) is
consistent with being produced by relativistic electrons diffused away from
supernova remnants in an outburst.",2005-05-18T11:13:17Z
Two-mirror Schwarzschild aplanats. Basic relations,"It is shown that the theory of aplanatic two-mirror telescopes developed by

"HST and UKIRT imaging observations of z~1 6C radio galaxies - II. Galaxy
  morphologies and the alignment effect","(abridged) Powerful radio galaxies often display enhanced optical/UV emission
regions, elongated and aligned with the radio jet axis. The aim of this series
of papers is to separately investigate the effects of radio power and redshift
on the alignment effect, together with other radio galaxy properties. In this
second paper, we present a deeper analysis of the morphological properties of
these systems, including both the host galaxies and their surrounding aligned
emission. The host galaxies of our 6C subsample are well described as de
Vaucouleurs ellipticals, with typical scale sizes of ~10kpc. This is comparable
to the host galaxies of low-z radio sources of similar powers, and also the
more powerful 3CR sources at the same redshift. The contribution of nuclear
point source emission is also comparable, regardless of radio power. The 6C
alignment effect is remarkably similar to that seen around more powerful 3CR
sources at the same redshift in terms of extent and degree of alignment with
the radio source axis, although it is generally less luminous. The bright,
knotty features observed in the case of the z~1 3CR sources are far less
frequent in our 6C subsample; neither do we observe such strong evidence for
evolution in the strength of the alignment effect with radio source size/age.
However, we do find a very strong link between the most extreme alignment
effects and emission line region properties indicative of shocks, regardless of
source size/age or power. In general, the 6C alignment effect is still
considerably stronger than that seen around lower redshift galaxies of similar
radio powers. (abridged)",2005-03-02T17:44:26Z
"Reconstruction of the One-point Distribution of Convergence from Weak
  Lensing by Large-scale Structure","Weak lensing measurements are starting to provide statistical maps of the
distribution of matter in the universe that are increasingly precise and
complementary to cosmic microwave background maps. The probability distribution
(PDF) provides a powerful tool to test non-Gausian features in the convergence
field and to discriminate the different cosmological models. In this letter, we
present a new PDF space Wiener filter approach to reconstruct the probability
density function of the convergence from the noisy convergence field. We find
that for parameters comparable to the CFHT legacy survey, the averaged PDF of
the convergence in a 3 degree field can be reconstructed with an uncertainty of
about 10%, even though the pointwise PDF is noise dominated.",2005-03-03T06:58:47Z
"The Emergence of the Thick Disk in a CDM Universe II: Colors and
  Abundance Patterns","The recently emerging conviction that thick disks are prevalent in disk
galaxies, and their seemingly ubiquitous old ages, means that the formation of
the thick disk, perhaps more than any other component, holds the key to
unravelling the evolution of the Milky Way, and indeed all disk galaxies. In
Paper I, we proposed that the thick disk was formed in an epoch of gas rich
mergers, at high redshift. This hypothesis was based on comparing N-body/SPH
simulations to a variety of Galactic and extragalactic observations, including
stellar kinematics, ages and chemical properties.Here examine our thick disk
formation scenario in light of the most recent observations of extragalactic
thick disks. In agreement, our simulted thick disks are old and relatively
metal rich, with V-I colors that do not vary significantly with distance from
the plane. Further, we show that our proposal results in an enhancement of
alpha-elements in thick disk stars as compared with thin disk stars, consistent
with observations of the relevant populations of the Milky Way. We also find
that our scenario naturally leads to the formation of an old metal weak stellar
halo population with high alpha-element abundances.",2005-03-11T20:59:28Z
"The VLT-FLAMES Survey of Massive Stars: Observations in the Galactic
  Clusters NGC 3293, NGC 4755 and NGC 6611","We introduce a new survey of massive stars in the Galaxy and the Magellanic
Clouds using the Fibre Large Array Multi-Element Spectrograph (FLAMES)
instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Here we present observations of
269 Galactic stars with the FLAMES-Giraffe Spectrograph (R ~ 25,000), in fields
centered on the open clusters NGC 3293, NGC 4755 and NGC 6611. These data are
supplemented by a further 50 targets observed with the Fibre-Fed Extended Range
Optical Spectrograph (FEROS, R = 48,000). Following a description of our
scientific motivations and target selection criteria, the data reduction
methods are described; of critical importance the FLAMES reduction pipeline is
found to yield spectra that are in excellent agreement with less automated
methods. Spectral classifications and radial velocity measurements are
presented for each star, with particular attention paid to morphological
peculiarities and evidence of binarity. These observations represent a
significant increase in the known spectral content of NGC 3293 and NGC 4755,
and will serve as standards against which our subsequent FLAMES observations in
the Magellanic Clouds will be compared.",2005-03-30T13:15:13Z
The connection between shear and star formation in spiral galaxies,"We present a sample of 33 galaxies for which we have calculated (i) the
average rate of shear from publish rotation curves, (ii) the far-infrared
luminosity from IRAS fluxes and (iii) The K-band luminosity from 2MASS. We show
that a correlation exists between the shear rate and the ratio of the
far-infrared to K-band luminosity. This ratio is essentially a measure of the
star formation rate per unit mass, or the specific star formation rate. From
this correlation we show that a critical shear rate exists, above which star
formation would turn off in the disks of spiral galaxies. Using the correlation
between shear rate and spiral arm pitch angle, this shear rate corresponds to
the lowest pitch angles typically measured in near-infrared images of spiral
galaxies.",2005-04-25T17:40:51Z
"Gemini Near Infrared Spectrograph Observations of a Red Star Forming
  Galaxy at z=2.225: Evidence for Shock-Ionization due to a Galactic Wind","Recent studies have shown that K-luminous galaxies at 2<z<2.5 have high
Halpha line widths and high [NII]/Halpha ratios. If these lines arise from
photo-ionization by massive stars in HII regions these results imply that
massive, metal rich galaxies exist at high redshift. Here we investigate the
ionization mechanism in a galaxy with Ks=19.1 and z=2.225 in the Chandra Deep
Field South, using the new Gemini Near Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS). GNIRS'
cross-dispersed mode gives simultaneous access to the entire 1-2.5 micron
wavelength range, allowing accurate measurements of line ratios of distant
galaxies. From the ratio of Halpha/Hbeta we infer that the line emitting gas is
heavily obscured, with E(B-V)=0.8. The reddening is higher than that inferred
previously from the UV-optical continuum emission, consistent with findings for
nearby star burst galaxies. We find that the galaxy has Seyfert-like line
ratios, [NII]/Halpha ~ 0.6 and [OIII]/Hbeta ~ 6, which can be caused by
photo-ionization by an active galactic nucleus (AGN) or shock ionization due to
a strong galactic wind. Although we cannot exclude the presence of an AGN, the
lack of AGN spectral features in the rest-frame ultraviolet, the consistency of
radio, X-ray, and rest-frame UV star formation indicators, the fact that the
[OIII]/Hbeta ratio remains high out to ~10 kpc from the nucleus, and the
observed gas kinematics all argue for the wind hypothesis. Similar
shock-induced ionization is seen in nearby star burst galaxies with strong
winds. The evidence for shock ionization implies that measurements of
metallicities and dynamical masses of star forming z>2 galaxies should be
regarded with caution, especially since the existence of strong galactic winds
in these objects is well established. [ABRIDGED]",2005-02-03T21:00:09Z
RETROCAM: A Versatile Optical Imager for Synoptic Studies,"We present RETROCAM, an auxiliary CCD camera that can be rapidly inserted
into the optical beam of the MDM 2.4m telescope. The speed and ease of
reconfiguring the telescope to use the imager and a straightforward user
interface permit the camera to be used during the course of other observing
programs. This in turn encourages RETROCAM's use for a variety of monitoring
projects.",2005-02-14T20:59:29Z
The SZ effect from cluster cavities,"In this Letter we derive the SZ effect (SZE) observable in the direction of
the giant X-ray cavities found in the atmospheres of galaxy clusters. We
explore specifically the case of the cluster MS0735.6+7421. The SZE produced in
the cavities embedded in the cluster thermal atmosphere is of non-thermal
nature: it dominates the overall cluster SZE at the frequency x_{0,th} - at
which the thermal SZE from the cluster vanishes - and appears, at mm and sub-mm
frequencies, as a negative SZE located only in the regions of the intracluster
space occupied by the cavities. We show that SZ observations, combined with
X-ray and radio data, are able to shed light on the morphology, on the physical
structure, on the dynamics and the origin of these recently discovered
non-thermal features of galaxy clusters. These studies will be also relevant to
determine the impact of specific events of the nature of cavities on the use of
SZ and X-ray clusters as probes for cosmology and for the large scale structure
of the universe.",2005-03-30T09:55:21Z
"Afterglow Light Curves from Impulsive Relativistic Jets with an
  Unconventional Structure","The jet structure in gamma-ray burst (GRB) sources is still largely an open
question. The leading models invoke either (i) a roughly uniform jet with sharp
edges, or (ii) a jet with a narrow core and wide wings where the energy per
solid angle drops as a power law with the angle $\theta$ from the jet symmetry
axis. Recently, a two component jet model has also been considered, with a
narrow uniform jet of initial Lorentz factor $\Gamma_0 \gtrsim 100$ surrounded
by a wider uniform jet with $\Gamma_0 \sim 10-30$. Some models predict more
exotic jet profiles, such as a thin uniform ring (i.e. the outflow is bounded
by two concentric cones of half opening angle $\theta_c$ and $\theta_c +
\Delta\theta$, with $\Delta\theta \ll \theta_c$) or a fan (a thin outflow with
$\Delta\theta \ll 1$ along the rotational equator, $\theta_c = \pi/2 +
\Delta\theta/2$). In this paper we calculate the expected afterglow light
curves from such jet structures, using a simple formalism that is developed
here for this purpose, and could also have other applications. These light
curves are qualitatively compared to observations of GRB afterglows. It is
shown that the two component jet model cannot produce sharp features in the
afterglow model due to the deceleration of the wide jet or the narrow jet
becoming visible at lines of sight outside of it. We find that a ""ring"" shaped
jet or a ""fan"" shaped jet produce a jet break in the afterglow light curve that
is too shallow compared to observations, where the change in the temporal decay
index across the jet break is about half of that for a uniform conical jet. For
a ""ring"" jet, the jet break is divided into two distinct and smaller breaks,
the first occurring when $\gamma\Delta\theta \sim 1-2$ and the second when
$\gamma\theta_c \sim 1/2$.",2005-04-11T23:05:41Z
A Dynamical Simulation of the Debris Disk Around HD 141569A,"We study the dynamical origin of the structures observed in the
scattered-light images of the resolved debris disk around HD 141569A. We
explore the roles of radiation pressure from the central star, gas drag from
the gas disk, and the tidal forces from two nearby stars in creating and
maintaining these structures. We use a simple one-dimensional axisymmetric
model to show that the presence of the gas helps confine the dust and that a
broad ring of dust is produced if a central hole exists in the disk. This model
also suggests that the disk is in a transient, excited dynamical state, as the
observed dust creation rate applied over the age of the star is inconsistent
with submillimeter mass measurements. We model in two dimensions the effects of
a fly-by encounter between the disk and a binary star in a prograde, parabolic,
coplanar orbit. We track the spatial distribution of the disk's gas,
planetesimals, and dust. We conclude that the surface density distribution
reflects the planetesimal distribution for a wide range of parameters. Our most
viable model features a disk of initial radius 400 AU, a gas mass of 50
M_earth, and beta = 4 and suggests that the system is being observed within
4000 yr of the fly-by periastron. The model reproduces some features of HD
141569A's disk, such as a broad single ring and large spiral arms, but it does
not reproduce the observed multiple spiral rings or disk asymmetries nor the
observed clearing in the inner disk. For the latter, we consider the effect of
a 5 M_Jup planet in an eccentric orbit on the planetesimal distribution of HD
141569A.",2005-03-21T16:00:53Z
"INTEGRAL spectroscopy of the accreting millisecond pulsar XTE J1807-294
  in outburst","The fourth transient accreting millisecond pulsar XTE J1807-294 was observed
during its February/March 2003 outburst by INTEGRAL, partly simultaneously with
the XMM-Newton and RXTE satellites. We present here the first study of the
0.5-200 keV broad-band spectra of the source. On February 28, the source
spectrum was consistent with thermal Comptonization by electrons of temperature
\~40 keV, considerably larger than the value (~10 keV) previously derived from
the low energy XMM-Newton data alone. The source is detected by INTEGRAL up to
200 keV with a luminosity in the energy band (0.1-200) keV of 1.3 x 10E37 erg/s
(assuming a distance of 8 kpc). 22 days later the luminosity dropped to 3.6 x
10E36 erg/s. A re-analysis of XMM-Newton data yields the orbital Doppler
variations of the pulse period and refines the previous ephemeris. For this
source having shortest orbital period of any known binary radio or X-ray
millisecond pulsar, we constrain the companion mass Mc < 0.022 Msun, assuming
minimum mass transfer driven by gravitational radiation. Only evolved dwarfs
with a C/O composition are consistent with the Roche lobe and gravitational
radiation constraints, while He dwarfs require an unlikely low inclination.",2005-03-14T12:30:52Z
"Three-dimensional MHD simulations of X-ray emitting subcluster plasmas
  in cluster of galaxies","Recent high resolution observations by the {\it Chandra} X-ray satellite
revealed various substructures in hot X-ray emitting plasmas in cluster of
galaxies. For example, {\it Chandra} revealed the existence of sharp
discontinuities in the surface brightness at the leading edge of subclusters in
merging clusters (e.g., Abell 3667), where the temperature drops sharply across
the fronts. These sharp edges are called cold fronts. We present results of
three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the interaction
between a dense subcluster plasma and ambient magnetized intracluster medium.
Anisotropic heat conduction along magnetic field lines is included. At the
initial state, magnetic fields are assumed to be uniform and transverse to the
motion of the dense subcluster. Since magnetic fields ahead of the subcluster
slip toward the third direction in the 3D case, the strength of magnetic fields
in this region can be reduced compared to that in the 2D case. Nevertheless, a
cold front can be maintained because the magnetic field lines wrapping around
the forehead of the subcluster suppress the heat conduction across them. On the
other hand, when the magnetic field is absent, a cold front cannot be
maintained because isotropic heat conduction from the hot ambient plasma
rapidly heats the cold subcluster plasma.",2005-04-09T20:17:50Z
Evidence for a co-moving sub-stellar companion of GQ Lup,"We present a companion of the \le 2 Myr young classical T Tauri star GQ Lup
in the Lupus star forming region at 140 \pm 50 pc from imaging, astrometry, and
spectroscopy. With direct K-band imaging using VLT/NACO, we detected an object
6 mag fainter than GQ Lup located 0.7 arc sec west of it. Compared to images
obtained 2 to 5 years earlier with Subaru/CIAO and HST/PC, this object shares
the proper motion of GQ Lup by 5 and 7 sigma, respectively, hence it is a
co-moving companion. Its K-L' color is consistent with a spectral type early to
mid L. Our NACO K-band spectrum yields spectral type M9-L4 with H2O and CO
absorption, consistent with the new GAIA-Dusty template spectrum for log g = 2
to 3 and Teff = 2000 K with ~2 Rjup radius at ~140 pc, hence few Jupiter
masses. Using the theoretical models from Wuchterl & Tscharnuter (2003),
Burrows et al. (1997), and Baraffe et al. (2002), the mass lies between 1 and
42 Jupiter masses.",2005-03-31T11:33:27Z
"Orbits in Extended Mass Distributions: General Results and the
  Spirographic Approximation","This paper explores orbits in extended mass distributions and develops an
analytic approximation scheme based on epicycloids (spirograph patterns). We
focus on the Hernquist potential which provides a good model for many
astrophysical systems, including elliptical galaxies, dark matter halos, and
young embedded star clusters. For a given potential, one can readily calculate
orbital solutions as a function of energy and angular momentum using numerical
methods. In contrast, this paper presents a number of analytic results for the
Hernquist potential and proves a series of general constraints showing that
orbits have similar properties for any extended mass distribution (including,
e.g., the NFW profile). We discuss circular orbits, radial orbits, zero energy
orbits, different definitions of eccentricity, analogs of Kepler's law, the
definition of orbital elements, and the relation of these orbits to spirograph
patterns (epicycloids). Over much of parameter space the orbits can be
adequately described (with accuracy better than 10%) using the parametric
equations of epicycloids, thereby providing an analytic description of the
orbits. As an application of this formal development, we find a solution for
the orbit of the Large Magellanic Cloud in the potential of our Galaxy.",2005-04-29T13:34:45Z
"Spitzer Studies of Ultracool Subdwarfs: Metal-poor Late-type M, L and T
  Dwarfs","Recent discoveries from red optical proper motion and wide-field
near-infrared surveys have uncovered a new population of ultracool subdwarfs,
metal-poor stars and brown dwarfs extending into the late-type M, L and
possibly T spectral classes. These objects are among the first low-mass stars
and brown dwarfs formed in the Galaxy, and are valuable tracers of metallicity
effects in low-temperature atmospheres. Like solar metallicity late-type
dwarfs, ultracool subdwarfs emit the majority of their emergent flux at
infrared wavelengths. Here I discuss how Spitzer observations will contribute
to the study of these objects, enabling measurement of the temperature scale,
tests for dust formation and the identification of surface gravity and
metallicity diagnostics in the coldest brown dwarfs.",2005-02-24T22:33:09Z
"Influence of two updated nuclear reaction rates on the evolution of low
  and intermediate mass stars","Two key reactions of hydrostatic nuclear burning in stars have recently been
revised by new experimental data - the 14N(p,gamma)15O and triple alpha
reaction rates. We investigate how much the new rates influence the evolution
of low-mass, metal-poor and metal-free, stars and of an intermediate-mass star
of solar-type composition. We concentrate on phases of helium ignition or
thermally unstable helium burning. Our global result is that the new triple
alpha rate has no significant influence on such stars, but that there is a
noticable, though small, effect of the new 14N(p,gamma)15O rate, in particular
on the core helium flash and the blue loop during core helium burning in the
intermediate-mass star.",2005-03-18T10:03:12Z
Phantom damping of matter perturbations,"Cosmological scaling solutions are particularly important in solving the
coincidence problem of dark energy. We derive the equations of sub-Hubble
linear matter perturbations for a general scalar-field Lagrangian--including
quintessence, tachyon, dilatonic ghost condensate and k-essence--and solve them
analytically for scaling solutions. We find that matter perturbations are
always damped if a phantom field is coupled to dark matter and identify the
cases in which the gravitational potential is constant. This provides an
interesting possibility to place stringent observational constraints on scaling
dark energy models.",2005-06-09T22:47:31Z
Discovery of a high-redshift Einstein ring,"We report the discovery of a partial Einstein ring of radius 1.48arcsec
produced by a massive (and seemingly isolated) elliptical galaxy. The
spectroscopic follow-up at the VLT reveals a 2L* galaxy at z=0.986, which is
lensing a post-starburst galaxy at z=3.773. This unique configuration yields a
very precise measure of the mass of the lens within the Einstein radius,
(8.3e11 +- 0.4)/h70 Msolar. The fundamental plane relation indicates an
evolution rate of d [log (M/L)B] / dz = -0.57+-0.04, similar to other massive
ellipticals at this redshift. The source galaxy shows strong interstellar
absorption lines indicative of large gas-phase metallicities, with fading
stellar populations after a burst. Higher resolution spectra and imaging will
allow the detailed study of an unbiased representative of the galaxy population
when the universe was just 12% of its current age.",2005-04-27T04:33:18Z
"Fully Threaded Transport Engine: New Method for Multi-Scale Radiative
  Transfer","A new, very fast method for 3D radiative transfer on fully threaded grids
with arbitrarily high angular resolution is presented. The method uses
completely cell-based discretization, and is ideally suited for problems with
diffuse background radiation, often encountered in cosmological and star
formation models. We find that for accurate statistical study of intergalactic
Ly-alpha absorption lines one needs of order of few hundred angular
discretization elements even for models without radiative feedback from star
forming galaxies.",2005-05-09T19:27:02Z
The basic parameters of gamma-ray-loud blazars,"We determined the basic parameters, such as the central black hole mass
($M$), the boosting factor (or Doppler factor) ($\delta$), the propagation
angle ($\Phi$) and the distance along the axis to the site of $\gamma$-ray
production ($d$) for 23 $\gamma$-ray-loud blazars using their available
variability timescales. In this method, the absorption effect depends on the
$\gamma$-ray energy, emission size and property of the accretion disk. Using
the intrinsic $\gamma$-ray luminosity as a fraction $\lambda$ of the Eddington
luminosity, $L^{in}_{\gamma}=\lambda L_{Ledd.}$ and the optical depth equal to
unity, we can determine the upper limit of the central black hole masses. We
found that the black hole masses range between $10^{7}M_{\odot}$ and
$10^{9}M_{\odot}$ when $\lambda$ = 0.1 and 1.0 are adopted. Since this method
is based on gamma-ray emissions and the short time-scale of the sources, it can
also be used for central black hole mass determination of high redshift
gamma-ray sources. In the case of the upper limit of black hole mass there is
no clear difference between BLs and FSRQs, which suggests that the central
black hole masses do not play an important role in the evolutionary sequence of
blazars.",2005-03-31T14:16:40Z
"Quasi-periodic oscillations: Resonant shear Alfv`en waves in neutron
  star magnetospheres","In this paper we propose a new model for quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs)
based on oscillating magnetohydrodynamic modes in neutron star magnetospheres.
We argue that the interaction of the accretion disk with the magnetosphere can
excite resonant shear Alfv`en waves in a region of enhanced density gradients,
the region where accretion material flows along the magnetic field lines in the
magnetosphere. We demonstrate that depending on the distance of this region
from the star and the magnetic field strength, the frequency of the field line
resonance can range from several Hz (weaker field, farther from star), to
approximately kHz frequencies (stronger field, ~ 2-10 stellar radii from the
star). We show that such oscillations are able to significantly modulate inflow
of matter from the high density region toward the star's surface, and possibly
produce the observed X-ray spectrum. In addition, we show that the observed 2:3
frequency ratio of QPOs is a natural result of our model.",2005-03-01T05:47:55Z
"Stochastic chemical enrichment in metal-poor systems II. Abundance
  ratios and scatter","A stochastic model of the chemical enrichment of metal-poor systems by
core-collapse supernovae is used to study the scatter in stellar abundance
ratios. The resulting scatter in abundance ratios, e.g. as functions of the
overall metallicity, is demonstrated to be crucially dependent on the as yet
uncertain supernovae yields. The observed abundance ratios and their scatters
therefore have diagnostic power as regards the yields. The relatively small
star-to-star scatter observed in many chemical abundance ratios, e.g. by Cayrel
et al. (2004) for stars down to [Fe/H] = -4, is tentatively explained by the
averaging of a large number of contributing supernovae and by the cosmic
selection effects favoring contributions from supernovae in a certain mass
range for the most metal-poor stars. The scatter in observed abundances of
alpha-elements is understood in terms of observational errors only, while
additional spread in yields or sites of nucleosynthesis may affect the odd-even
elements Na and Al. For the iron-group elements we find systematically too high
predicted Cr/Fe and Cr/Mg ratios, as well as differences between the different
sets of yields, both in terms of predicted abundance ratios and scatter. The
semi-empirical yields recently suggested by Francois et al. (2004) are found to
lead to scatter in abundance ratios significantly greater than observed, when
applied in the inhomogeneous models. ""Spurs"", very narrow sequences in
abundance-ratio diagrams, may disclose a single-supernova origin of the
elements of the stars on the sequence. Verification of the existence of such
features, called single supernova sequences (SSSs), is challenging. This will
require samples of several hundred stars with abundance ratios observed to
accuracies of 0.05 dex or better.",2005-04-27T20:39:05Z
"The Growth of the Local Void and the Origin of the Local Velocity
  Anomaly","The Local Void is the nearest void from us and is thought to be playing an
important role in the kinematics of the local universe, especially as one of
the suspected source of the motion of the Local Group. The imbalance between
the mass in the Local Void region and that contained in the concentration at
the opposite side might contribute to the velocity of the Local group
perpendicular to the Supergalactic plane, and this would be a prototype of the
evolution of the large-scale structure. The proximity of the Local Void
provides us the exclusive opportunity to investigate the kinematics around a
void. Here we report the results of our observational study of the peculiar
velocities of about 40 galaxies at the far-side of the Local Void, using the
near-infrared Tully-Fisher relation. The galaxies at the boundary of the void
shows an excess of receding motion, suggesting the expansion of the Local Void.
We examined the effect of selection biases on the peculiar velocity
distribution, and concluded that the excess of receding motion could not fully
attribute to selection biases.",2005-05-26T10:58:26Z
"Energisation of interstellar media and cosmic ray production by jets
  from X-ray binaries","Drawing on recent estimates of the power of jets from X-ray binary systems as
a function of X-ray luminosity, combined with improved estimates of the
relevant Log(N)-Log(L_X) luminosity functions, we calculate the total energy
input to the interstellar medium (ISM) from these objects. The input of kinetic
energy to the ISM via jets is dominated by those of the black hole systems, in
contrast to the radiative input, which is dominated by accreting neutron stars.
Summing the energy input from black hole jets L_J in the Milky Way, we find
that it is likely to correspond to >1% of L_SNe, the time-averaged kinetic
luminosity of supernovae, and >5% of L_CR, the cosmic ray luminosity. Given
uncertainties in jet power estimates, significantly larger contributions are
possible. Furthermore, in elliptical galaxies with comparable distributions of
low mass X-ray binaries, but far fewer supernovae, the ratio L_J / L_SNe is
likely to be larger by a factor of ~5. We conclude that jets from X-ray
binaries may be an important, distributed, source of kinetic energy to the ISM
in the form of relativistic shocks, and as a result are likely to be a major
source of cosmic rays.",2005-04-08T14:27:56Z
Neutrino Detection with Inclined Air Showers,"The possibilities of detecting high energy neutrinos through inclined showers
produced in the atmosphere are addressed with an emphasis on the detection of
air showers by arrays of particle detectors. Rates of inclined showers produced
by both down-going neutrino interactions and by up-coming $\tau$ decays from
earth-skimming neutrinos as a function of shower energy are calculated with
analytical methods using two sample neutrino fluxes with different spectral
indices. The relative contributions from different flavors and charged, neutral
current and resonant interactions are compared for down-going neutrinos
interacting in the atmosphere. No detailed description of detectors is
attempted but rough energy thresholds are implemented to establish the ranges
of energies which are more suitable for neutrino detection through inclined
showers. Down-going and up-coming rates are compared.",2005-04-27T19:48:39Z
"Parameters of the prompt gamma-ray burst emission estimated with the
  opening angle of jets","We present in this paper an approach to estimate the initial Lorentz factor
of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) without referring to the delayed emission of the
early afterglow. Under the assumption that the afterglow of the bursts
concerned occurs well before the prompt emission dies away, the Lorentz factor
measured at the time when the duration of the prompt emission is ended could be
estimated by applying the well-known relations of GRB jets. With the concept of
the efficiency for converting the explosion energy to radiation, this Lorentz
factor can be related to the initial Lorentz factor of the source. The
corresponding rest frame peak energy can accordingly be calculated. Applying
this method, we estimate the initial Lorentz factor of the bulk motion and the
corresponding rest frame spectral peak energy of GRBs for a new sample where
the redshift and the break time in the afterglow are known. Our analysis shows
that, in the circumstances, the initial Lorentz factor of the sample would peak
at 200 and would be distributed mainly within $(100,400)$, and the peak of the
distribution of the corresponding rest frame peak energy would be $0.8keV$ and
its main region would be $(0.3keV,3keV)$.",2005-04-04T14:38:09Z
AGN feedback and gas mixing in the core of NGC 4636,"Chandra observations of NGC 4636 show disturbances in the galaxy X-ray halo,
including arm-like high surface brightness features (tentatively identified as
AGN driven shocks) and a possible cavity on the west side of the galaxy core.
We present Chandra and XMM spectral maps of NGC 4636 which confirm the presence
of the cavity and show it to be bounded by the arm features. The maps also
reveal a ~15 kpc wide plume of low temperature, high abundance gas extending
25-30 kpc to the southwest of the galaxy. The cavity appears to be embedded in
this plume, and we interpret the structure as being entrained gas drawn out of
the galaxy core during previous episodes of AGN activity. The end of the plume
is marked by a well defined edge, with significant falls in surface brightness,
temperature and abundance, indicating a boundary between galaxy and
group/cluster gas. This may be evidence that as well as preventing gas cooling
through direct heating, AGN outbursts can produce significant gas mixing,
disturbing the temperature structure of the halo and transporting metals out
from the galaxy into the surrounding intra-group medium.",2005-03-25T16:51:37Z
"VLT Spectroscopy of Globular Cluster Systems, I. The Photometric and
  Spectroscopic Dataset","We present Lick line-index measurements of extragalactic globular clusters in
seven early-type galaxies (NGC 1380, 2434, 3115, 3379, 3585, 5846, and 7192)
with different morphological types (E-S0) located in field and group/cluster
environments. High-quality spectra were taken with the FORS2 instrument at
ESO's Very Large Telescope. About 50% of our data allow an age resolution dt/t
~ 0.3 and a metallicity resolution ~0.25-0.4 dex, depending on the absolute
metallicity. Globular cluster candidates are selected from deep B, V, R, I, K
FORS2/ISAAC photometry with 80-100% success rate inside one effective radius.
Using combined optical/near-infrared colour-colour diagrams we present a method
to efficiently reduce fore-/background contamination down to <10%. We find
clear signs for bi-modality in the globular cluster colour distributions of NGC
1380, 3115, and 3585. The colour distributions of globular clusters in NGC
2434, 3379, 5846, and 7192 are consistent with a broad single-peak
distribution. For the analysed globular cluster systems the slopes of projected
radial surface density profiles, of the form Sigma(R) ~ R^-Gamma, vary between
~0.8 and 2.6. Using globular clusters as a tracer population we determine total
dynamical masses of host galaxies out to large radii (~1.6 - 4.8 Reff). For the
sample we find masses in the range ~8.8*10^10 Msolar up to ~1.2*10^12 Msolar.
The line index data presented here will be used in accompanying papers of this
series to derive ages, metallicities and abundance ratios. A compilation of
currently available high-quality Lick index measurements for globular clusters
in elliptical, lenticular, and late-type galaxies is provided and will serve to
augment the current data set. [abridged]",2005-05-20T17:11:31Z
A Reverse-Shock Model for the Early Afterglow of GRB 050525A,"The prompt localization of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 050525A by {\em Swift}
allowed the rapid follow-up of the afterglow. The observations revealed that
the optical afterglow had a major rebrightening starting at $\sim 0.01$ days
and ending at $\sim 0.03$ days, which was followed by an initial power-law
decay. Here we show that this early emission feature can be interpreted as the
reverse shock emission superposed by the forward shock emission in an
interstellar medium environment. By fitting the observed data, we further
constrain some parameters of the standard fireball-shock model: the initial
Lorentz factor of the ejecta $\gamma_0>120$, the magnetic energy fraction
$\epsilon_B>4\times10^{-6}$, and the medium density $n<2 {\rm cm^{-3}}$. These
limits are consistent with those from the other very-early optical afterglows
observed so far. In principle, a wind environment for GRB 050525A is
disfavored.",2005-06-07T09:18:08Z
"The Molecular Connection to the FIR-Radio Continuum Correlation in
  Galaxies","We have studied the relationships between the radio continuum (RC) and CO
emission for a set of galaxies selected from the BIMA Survey of Nearby
Galaxies. We find that the global CO-RC correlation is as tight as the global
FIR-RC correlation for the 24 galaxies studied. Within 9 galaxies with ~6
arcsec CO and RC data available, the CO and RC emission is as tightly
correlated as its global value; the radially averaged correlation is nearly
linear, extends over four order of magnitude and holds down to the smallest
linear resolution of the observations, which is ~100 pc. We define qco as the
log of the ratio of the CO to RC flux as a way to characterize the CO-RC
correlation. Combining 6 arcsec pixel-by-pixel comparisons across all sources
yields an average small-scale correlation of qco = 1.1 +/- 0.28; that is, the
spatially resolved correlation has a dispersion that is less than a factor of
2. There are however systematic variations in the CO/RC ratio; the strongest
organized structures in qco tend to be found along spiral arms and on size
scales much larger than the resolution of the observations. We do not measure
any systematic trend in CO/RC ratio as a function of radius in galaxies. The
constancy of the CO/RC ratio stands in contrast to the previously measured
decrease in the FIR/RC ratio as a function of radius in galaxies. We suggest
that the excellent correlation between the CO, RC and FIR emission in galaxies
is a consequence of regulation by hydrostatic pressure; this model links all
three emissions without invoking an explicit dependence on a star formation
scenario.",2005-03-25T17:20:47Z
"Discovery of a Radio Supernova Remnant and Non-thermal X-rays Coincident
  with the TeV Source HESS J1813-178","We present the discovery of non-thermal radio and X-ray emission positionally
coincident with the TeV $\gamma$-ray source HESS J1813--178. We demonstrate
that the non-thermal radio emission is due to a young shell-type supernova
remnant (SNR) G12.8--0.0, and constrain its distance to be greater than 4 kpc.
The X-ray emission is primarily non-thermal and is consistent with either an
SNR shell or unidentified pulsar/pulsar wind nebula origin; pulsed emission is
not detected in archival ASCA data. A simple synchrotron+inverse Compton model
for the broadband emission assuming that all of the emission arises from the
SNR shell implies maximum energies of $(30-450)(B/10 microG)^{-0.5}$ TeV.
Further observations are needed to confirm that the broadband emission has a
common origin and better constrain the X-ray spectrum.",2005-05-07T23:39:53Z
"Signature of Galactic Outflows as Absorption-Free Gaps in the Ly-alpha
  Forest","Powerful outflows from star-forming galaxies are expected to push away the
neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) around those galaxies, and produce
absorption-free gaps in the Ly-alpha forest. We analyze the abundance of gaps
of various sizes in three high resolution spectra of quasars at z ~ 3 - 3.5.
The gap statistics agrees well with a model in which galactic halos above a
minimum mass scale of M_min ~ 10^10 M_sun produce bubbles with a characteristic
radius of R_b ~ 0.48 Mpc/h. Both numbers are consistent with naive theoretical
expectations, where the minimum galaxy mass reflects the threshold for infall
of gas out of a photo-ionized IGM. The observed gaps are typically bounded by
deep absorption features as expected from the accumulation of swept-up gas on
the bubble walls.",2005-05-10T04:36:41Z
Bulk viscosity driving the acceleration of the Universe,"The possibility that the present acceleration of the universe is driven by a
kind of viscous fluid is exploited. At background level this model is similar
to the generalized Chaplygin gas model (GCGM). But, at perturbative level, the
viscous fluid exhibits interesting properties. In particular the oscillations
in the power spectrum that plagues the GCGM are not present. Possible
fundamental descriptions for this viscous dark energy are discussed.",2005-03-16T18:24:13Z
"Discovery of a candidate protoplanetary disk around the embedded source
  IRc9 in Orion","We report the detection of spatially-extended mid-infrared emission around
the luminous embedded star IRc9 in OMC-1, as seen in 8.8, 11.7, and 18.3 micron
images obtained with T-ReCS on Gemini South. The extended emission is
asymmetric, and the morphology is reminiscent of warm dust disks around other
young stars. The putative disk has a radius of roughly 1.5 arcsec (700 AU), and
a likely dust mass of almost 10 Earth masses. The infrared spectral energy
distribution of IRc9 indicates a total luminosity of about 100 Lsun, implying
that it shall become an early A-type star when it reaches the main sequence.
Thus, the candidate disk around IRc9 may be a young analog of the planetary
debris disks around Vega-like stars and the disks of Herbig Ae stars, and may
provide a laboratory in which to study the earliest phases of planet formation.
A disk around IRc9 may also add weight to the hypothesis that an enhanced T
Tauri-like wind from this star has influenced the molecular outflow from the
OMC-1 core.",2005-02-08T22:24:23Z
A new approach to the Sachs-Wolfe effect,"We present a new approach to the Sachs-Wolfe effect, which is based on the
dynamics of photons in a space and time varying gravitational field. We
consider the influence of plasma dispersion effects on photon propagation, and
establish the limits of validity of the usual results of the standard
cosmological approach, for the large scale temperature anisotropies of the
cosmic microwave background. New dynamical contributions to the integrated
Sachs-Wolfe effect are also discussed.",2005-03-14T18:51:25Z
Flare X-ray observations of AB Dor: evidence for Stellar Coronal Opacity,"X-ray spectra of the late-type star AB Dor, obtained with the XMM-Newton
satellite are analysed. AB Dor was particularly active during the observations.
An emission measure reconstruction technique is employed to analyse flare and
quiescent spectra, with emphasis on the Fe XVII 15-17 A wavelength region. The
Fe XVII 16.78 A/15.01 A line ratio increases significantly in the hotter flare
plasma. This change in the ratio is opposite to the theoretical predictions and
is attributed to the scattering of 15.01 A line photons from the line-of-sight.
The escape probability technique indicates an optical depth of about 0.4 for
the 15.01 A line. During the flare, the electron density is 4.4*10^10 cm^-3 and
the fractional Fe abundance is 0.5 +/- 0.1 of the solar photospheric value.
Using these parameters a path length of about 8,000 km is derived. There is no
evidence for opacity in the quiescent X-ray spectrum of the star.",2005-02-03T11:13:25Z
"Self-Similar Evolution of Relativistic Shock Waves Emerging from
  Plane-Parallel Atmospheres","We study the evolution of the ultra-relativistic shock wave in a
plane-parallel atmosphere adjacent to a vacuum and the subsequent breakout
phenomenon. When the density distribution has a power law with the distance
from the surface, there is a self-similar motion of the fluid before and after
the shock emergence. The time evolution of the Lorentz factor of the shock
front is assumed to follow a power law when the time is measured from the
moment at which the shock front reaches the surface. The power index is found
to be determined by the condition for the flow to extend through a critical
point. The energy spectrum of the ejected matter as a result of the shock
breakout is derived and its dependence on the strength of the explosion is also
deduced. The results are compared with the self-similar solution for the same
problem with non-relativistic treatment.",2005-03-11T02:39:04Z
Transit Lightcurve Signatures of Artificial Objects,"The forthcoming space missions, able to detect Earth-like planets by the
transit method, will a fortiori also be able to detect the transit of
artificial planet-size objects. Multiple artificial objects would produce
lightcurves easily distinguishable from natural transits. If only one
artificial object transits, detecting its artificial nature becomes more
difficult. We discuss the case of three different objects (triangle, 2-screen,
louver-like 6-screen) and show that they have a transit lightcurve
distinguishable from the transit of natural planets, either spherical or
oblate, although an ambiguity with the transit of a ringed planet exists in
some cases. We show that transits, especially in the case of multiple
artificial objects, could be used for the emission of attention-getting
signals, with a sky coverage comparable to the laser pulse method. The large
number of expected planets (several hundreds) to be discovered by the transit
method by next space missions will allow to test these ideas.",2005-03-27T17:30:43Z
"The detection of Class I methanol masers towards regions of low-mass
  star formation","Six young bipolar outflows in regions of low-to-intermediate-mass star
formation were observed in the 7_0-6_1A+, 8_0-7_1A+, and 5_{-1}-4_0E methanol
lines at 44, 95, and 84 GHz, respectively. Narrow features were detected
towards NGC 1333IRAS4A, HH 25MMS, and L1157 B1. Flux densities of the detected
lines are no higher than 11 Jy, which is much lower than the flux densities of
strong maser lines in regions of high-mass star formation. Analysis shows that
most likely the narrow features are masers.",2005-05-11T10:37:14Z
Implications of the Curvaton on Inflationary Cosmology,"We study implications of the curvaton, a late-decaying light scalar field, on
inflationary cosmology, paying particular attentions to modifications of
observable quantities such as the scalar spectral index of the primordial power
spectrum and the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We consider this issue from a general
viewpoint and discuss how the observable quantities are affected by the
existence of the curvaton. It is shown that the modification owing to the
curvaton depends on class of inflation models. We also study the effects of the
curvaton on inflation models generated by the inflationary flow equation.",2005-05-17T06:45:39Z
In-situ Particle Acceleration in Collisionless Shocks,"The outflows from gamma ray bursts, active galactic nuclei and relativistic
jets in general interact with the surrounding media through collisionless
shocks. With three dimensional relativistic particle-in-cell simulations we
investigate such shocks. The results from these experiments show that
small--scale magnetic filaments with strengths of up to percents of
equipartition are generated and that electrons are accelerated to power law
distributions N(E)~E^{-p} in the vicinity of the filaments through a new
acceleration mechanism. The acceleration is locally confined, instantaneous and
differs from recursive acceleration processes such as Fermi acceleration. We
find that the proposed acceleration mechanism competes with thermalization and
becomes important at high Lorentz factors.",2005-02-18T09:53:19Z
Searching for Transiting Planets in Stellar Systems,"We analyze the properties of searches devoted to finding planetary transits
by observing simple stellar systems, such as globular clusters, open clusters,
and the Galactic bulge. We develop the analytic tools necessary to predict the
number of planets that a survey will detect as a function of the parameters of
the system, the observational setup, site properties, and planet properties. We
find that the detection probability is generally maximized for I-band
observations. The signal-to-noise ratio of a planetary transit is weakly
dependent on the mass of the primary for sources with flux above the sky
background, and falls very sharply for sources below sky. Therefore the number
of detectable planets is roughly proportional to the number of stars with
fluxes above sky (and not necessarily the number of sources with photometric
error less a given threshold). In order to maximize the number of detections,
experiments should be tailored such that stars near sky are above the detection
threshold. Once this requirement is met, the number of detected planets is
relatively weakly dependent on the detection threshold, diameter of the
telescope, exposure time, seeing, age of the system, and planet radius. The
number of detected planets is a strongly decreasing function of the distance to
the system, implying that the nearest, richest clusters may prove to be optimal
targets.",2005-04-06T20:01:46Z
The Vega Debris Disk -- A Surprise from Spitzer,"We present high spatial resolution mid- and far-infrared images of the Vega
debris disk obtained with the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS).
The disk is well resolved and its angular size is much larger than found
previously. The radius of the disk is at least 43"" (330 AU), 70""(543 AU), and
105"" (815 AU) in extent at 24, 70 and 160 um, respectively. The disk images are
circular, smooth and without clumpiness at all three wavelengths. The radial
surface brightness profiles imply an inner boundary at a radius of 11""+/-2"" (86
AU). Assuming an amalgam of amorphous silicate and carbonaceous grains, the
disk can be modeled as an axially symmetric and geometrically thin disk, viewed
face-on, with the surface particle number density following an r^-1 power law.
The disk radiometric properties are consistent with a range of models using
grains of sizes ~1 to ~50 um. We find that a ring, containing grains larger
than 180 um and at radii of 86-200 AU from the star, can reproduce the observed
850 um flux, while its emission does not violate the observed MIPS profiles.
This ring could be associated with a population of larger asteroidal bodies
analogous to our own Kuiper Belt. Cascades of collisions starting with
encounters amongthese large bodies in the ring produce the small debris that is
blown outward by radiation pressure to much larger distances where we detect
its thermal emission. The dust production rate is >~10^15 g/s based on the MIPS
results. This rate would require a very massive asteroidal reservoir for the
dust to be produced in a steady state throughout Vega's life. Instead, we
suggest that the disk we imaged is ephemeral and that we are witnessing the
aftermath of a large and relatively recent collisional event, and subsequent
collisional cascade.",2005-04-04T21:33:42Z
"Subaru Mid-infrared Imaging of the Quadruple Lenses PG1115+080 and
  B1422+231: Limits on Substructure Lensing","We present mid-infrared imaging at 11.7 mu m for the quadruple lens systems,
PG1115+080 and B1422+231, using the cooled mid-infrared camera and spectrometer
(COMICS) attached on the Subaru telescope. These lensed QSOs are characterized
by their anomalous optical and radio flux ratios as obtained for (A1, A2)
images of PG1115+080 and (A, B, C) images of B1422+231, respectively, i.e.,
such flux ratios are hardly reproduced by lens models with smooth mass
distribution. Our mid-infrared observations for these images have revealed that
the mid-infrared flux ratio A2/A1 of PG1115+080 is virtually consistent with
smooth lens models (but inconsistent with the optical flux ratio), whereas for
B1422+231, the mid-infrared flux ratios among (A, B, C) are in good agreement
with the radio flux ratios. We also identify a clear infrared bump in the
spectral energy distributions of these QSOs, thereby indicating that the
observed mid-infrared fluxes originate from a hot dust torus around a QSO
nucleus. Based on the size estimate of the dust torus, we place limits on the
mass of a substructure in these lens systems, causing the anomalous optical or
radio flux ratios. For PG1115+080, the mass of a substructure inside an
Einstein radius, M_E, is < 16 Msun, corresponding to either a star or a
low-mass CDM subhalo having the mass of M_{100}^{SIS} < 2.2 * 10^4 Msun inside
radius of 100 pc if modeled as a singular isothermal sphere (SIS). For
B1422+231, we obtain M_E > 209 Msun, indicating that a CDM subhalo is more
likely, having the mass of M_{100}^{SIS} > 7.4 * 10^4 Msun",2005-03-22T21:47:31Z
"Effective equation of state for dark energy: mimicking quintessence and
  phantom energy through a variable Lambda","While there is mounting evidence in all fronts of experimental cosmology for
a non-vanishing dark energy component in the Universe, we are still far away
from understanding its ultimate nature. A fundamental cosmological constant,
Lambda, is the most natural candidate, but many dynamical mechanisms to
generate an effective Lambda have been devised which postulate the existence of
a peculiar scalar field (so-called quintessence, and generalizations thereof).
These models are essentially ad hoc, but they lead to the attractive
possibility of a time-evolving dark energy with a non-trivial equation of state
(EOS). Most, if not all, future experimental studies on precision cosmology
(e.g. the SNAP and PLANCK projects) address very carefully the determination of
an EOS parametrized ``a la quintessence''. Here we show that by fitting
cosmological data to an EOS of that kind can also be interpreted as a hint of a
fundamental, but time-evolving, cosmological term: Lambda=Lambda(t). We
exemplify this possibility by studying the effective EOS associated to a
renormalization group (RG) model for Lambda. We find that the effective EOS can
correspond to both normal quintessence and phantom dark energy, depending on
the value of a single parameter of the RG model. We conclude that behind a
non-trivial EOS of a purported quintessence or phantom scalar field there can
actually be a running cosmological term of a fundamental quantum field theory.",2005-05-06T18:28:51Z
"Relativistic r-modes and Shear viscosity: regularizing the continuous
  spectrum","Within a fully relativistic framework, we derive and solve numerically the
perturbation equations of relativistic stars, including the stresses produced
by a non-vanishing shear viscosity in the stress-energy tensor. With this
approach, the real and imaginary parts of the frequency of the modes are
consistently obtained. We find that, approaching the inviscid limit from the
finite viscosity case, the continuous spectrum is regularized and we can
calculate the quasi-normal modes for stellar models that do not admit solutions
at first order in perturbation theory when the coupling between the polar and
axial perturbations is neglected. The viscous damping time is found to agree
within factor 2 with the usual estimate obtained by using the eigenfunctions of
the inviscid limit and some approximation for the energy dissipation integrals.
We find that the frequencies and viscous damping times for relativistic
$r-$modes lie between the Newtonian and Cowling results. We compare the results
obtained with homogeneous, polytropic and realistic equations of state and find
that the frequencies depend only on the rotation rate and on the compactness
parameter (M/R), being almost independent of the equation of state. Our
numerical results for realistic neutron stars give viscous damping times with
the same dependence on mass and radius as previously estimated, but
systematically larger of about 60%.",2005-04-04T10:11:00Z
Effects of photon escape on diagnostic diagrams for HII regions,"In this article we first outline the mounting evidence that a significant
fraction of the ionizing photons emitted by OB stars within HII regions escape
from their immediate surroundings and explain how an HII region structure
containing high density contrast in homogeneities facilitates this escape. Next
we describe sets of models containing inhomogeneities which are used to predict
tracks in the commonly used diagnostic diagrams (based on ratios of emission
lines) whose only independent variable is the photon escape fraction, xi. We
show that the tracks produced by the models in two of the most cited of these
diagrams conform well to the distribution of observed data points, with the
models containing optically thick inhomogeneities (""CLUMPY"" models) yielding
somewhat better agreement than those with optically thin inhomogeneities (""FF""
models). We show how variations in the ionization parameter U, derived from
emission line ratios, could be due to photon escape. Using a rather wide range
of assumptions about the filling factor of dense clumps we find, for a selected
set of regions observed in M51 photon escape fraction ranging between 30% and
50%. We show, using oxygen as the test element, that models with different
assumptions about the gas inhomogeneity will give variations in the abundance
values derived from diagnostic diagrams, but do not claim here to have a fully
developed set of diagnostic tools to improve abundance determinations made in
this way. We finally propose a combination of line ratios with the absolute
Halpha luminosity of a given HII region, which allows us to determine the
photon escape fraction, and hence resolve the degeneracy between U and xi.",2005-04-11T09:46:30Z
"Searching for galaxy clusters using the aperture mass statistics in 50
  VLT fields","Application of the aperture mass (Map-) statistics provides a weak lensing
method for the detection of cluster-sized dark matter halos. We present a new
aperture filter function and maximise the effectiveness of the Map-statistics
to detect cluster-sized halos using analytical models. We then use weak lensing
mock catalogues generated from ray-tracing through N-body simulations, to
analyse the effect of image treatment on the expected number density of halos.
Using the Map-statistics, the aperture radius is typically several arcminutes,
hence the aperture often lies partly outside a data field, consequently the
signal-to-noise ratio of a halo detection decreases. We study these border
effects analytically and by using mock catalogues. We find that the expected
number density of halos decreases by a factor of two if the size of a field is
comparable to the diameter of the aperture used. We finally report on the
results of a weak lensing cluster search applying the Map-statistics to 50
randomly selected fields which were observed with FORS1 at the VLT. Altogether
the 50 VLT fields cover an area of 0.64 square degrees. The I-band images were
taken under excellent seeing conditions (average seeing 0.6 arcsec.) which
results in a high number density of galaxies used for the weak lensing analysis
(26/sq.arcmin). In five of the VLT fields, we detect a significant Map-signal
which coincides with an overdensity of the light distribution. These detections
are thus excellent candidates for shear-selected clusters.",2005-04-28T15:03:41Z
"The Cornell High-order Adaptive Optics Survey for Brown Dwarfs in
  Stellar Systems-I: Observations, Data Reduction, and Detection Analysis","In this first of a two-paper sequence, we report techniques and results of
the Cornell High-order Adaptive Optics Survey for brown dwarf companions
(CHAOS). At the time of this writing, this study represents the most sensitive
published population survey of brown dwarf companions to main sequence stars,
for separation akin to our own outer solar system. The survey, conducted using
the Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope, consists of K-short coronagraphic
observations of 80 main sequence stars out to 22 parsecs. At 1 arcsecond
separations from a typical target system, the survey achieves median
sensitivities 10 magnitudes fainter than the parent star. In terms of companion
mass, the survey achieves typical sensitivities of 25 Jupiter masses (1 Gyr),
50 Jupiter masses (solar age), and 60 Jupiter masses (10 Gyr), using
evolutionary models of Baraffe et al. (2003). Using common proper motion to
distinguish companions from field stars, we find that no systems show positive
evidence of a substellar companion (searchable separation 1-15 arcseconds
[projected separation ~ 10-155 AU at the median target distance]). In the
second paper of the series we shall present our Monte Carlo population
simulations.",2005-06-13T19:30:03Z

Can LISA Resolve Distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud?,"The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to detect N ~ 22
[x10^(+/- 1)] close white dwarf binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)
through their gravitational radiation with signal-to-noise ratios greater than
10 in observational durations of 3 years or more. In addition to chirp mass,
location on the sky, and other binary parameters, the distance to each binary
is an independent parameter that can be extracted from an analysis of
gravitational waves from these binaries. Using a sample of binaries, one can
establish the mean distance to the LMC as well as the variance of this
distance. Assuming no confusion noise at frequencies above 2 mHz, LISA might
determine the LMC distance to ~ 4.5 (N/22)^(1/2)% and the line of sight extent
of LMC to ~ 15 (N/22)^(1/4)$%, relative to its distance, at the one-sigma
confidence. These estimates are competitive to some of the proposed direct
geometric techniques to measure LMC distance in future with missions such as
SIM and GAIA.",2005-02-23T23:35:57Z
"MCG-6-30-15: Long Timescale X-Ray Variability, Black Hole Mass and AGN
  High States","We present a detailed study of the long-timescale X-ray variability of the
Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) Galaxy MCG-6-30-15, based on 8 years of frequent
observations with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. Combined with short
timescale XMM-Newton observations, we derive the powerspectral density (PSD)
covering 6 decades from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-2} Hz. As with NGC4051, another NLS1,
the PSD of MCG-6-30-15 is a close analogue of the PSD of a Galactic Black Hole
X-ray binary system (GBH) in a `high' rather than a `low' state. Like high
state GBHs, its PSD is better fitted by a smoothly bending rather than sharply
breaking powerlaw model and the break frequency is 7.6^{+10}_{-3} x 10^{-5} Hz.
Assuming linear scaling of break frequency with mass, we estimate the black
hole (BH) mass in MCG-6-30-15 to be ~2.9^{+1.8}_{-1.6} X 10^{6} solar masses.
We also derive the BH mass using a variety of new optical observations and find
a value between 3.6 and 6 x 10^{6} solar masses, consistent with the mass
derived from the PSD. Combining these data with revised reverberation masses
for other AGN we update the BH mass/break timescale diagram. The observations
are consistent with NLS1s having shorter break timescales, for a given mass,
than broad line AGN, probably reflecting a higher accretion rate. However the
data are also consistent with all of the X-ray bright AGN being high state
objects. This result may simply be a selection effect, based on their selection
from X-ray all sky catalogues, and their consequent typically high X-ray/radio
ratios, which indicate high state systems.",2005-03-04T16:16:42Z
Is FIRST J102347.6+003841 Really a Cataclysmic Binary?,"The radio source FIRST J102347.6+003841 was presented as the first
radio-selected cataclysmic. In the discovery paper, Bond et al. (2002) show a
spectrum consistent with a magnetic AM Her-type system and a light curve with
rapid, irregular flickering. In contrast, Woudt, Warner, and Pretorius (2004)
found a smoothly-varying light curve with a period near 4.75 h and one minimum
per orbit, indicating a dramatic change. We present time-resolved spectra
showing a superficially normal, mid-G type photosphere, with no detectable
emission lines. The absorption-line radial velocity varies sinusoidally, with
semi-amplitude 268 +- 4 km/s, on the orbital period, which is refined to
0.198094(2) d. At this orbital period the secondary's spectral type is
atypically early, suggesting an unusual evolutionary history. We also obtained
BVI photometry around the orbit. The light curve resembles that given by Woudt
et al., and the color modulation is consistent with a heating effect. A simple
illumination model matches the observations strikingly well with a Roche-lobe
filling secondary near 5650 kelvin being illuminated by a primary giving out
around 2 solar luminosities. The modest amplitude of the observed modulation
constrains the orbital inclination to be less than about 55 deg, unless the
gravity darkening is artificially reduced. The resulting primary star mass is
above the Chandrasekhar limit (assuming conventional gravity darkening). We
examine the possibility that the compact object in this system is not a white
dwarf, in which case this is not actually a cataclysmic variable. On close
examination, FIRST J102347.6+003841 defies easy classification.",2005-04-24T01:02:52Z

Paschen-Back regime for typical conditions found in solar and stellar

the Zeeman structure of this multiplet in the Paschen-Back regime are
approximated here by polynomials. The fitting errors are smaller than
$\sim10^{-2}$ m\AA in the component positions and $\sim10^{-3}$ in the relative
strengths. The approximant polynomials allow for a very fast implementation of
the incomplete Paschen-Back regime in numerical codes for the synthesis and
inversion of polarization profiles in this important multiplet.",2005-05-16T15:21:58Z
"Lorentz violation at high energy: concepts, phenomena and astrophysical
  constraints","We consider here the possibility of quantum gravity induced violation of
Lorentz symmetry (LV). Even if suppressed by the inverse Planck mass such LV
can be tested by current experiments and astrophysical observations. We review
the effective field theory approach to describing LV, the issue of naturalness,
and many phenomena characteristic of LV. We discuss some of the current
observational bounds on LV, focusing mostly on those from high energy
astrophysics in the QED sector at order E/M_Planck. In this context we present
a number of new results which include the explicit computation of rates of the
most relevant LV processes, the derivation of a new photon decay constraint,
and modification of previous constraints taking proper account of the helicity
dependence of the LV parameters implied by effective field theory.",2005-05-12T19:55:28Z
"Open Cluster Birth Analysis and Multiple Spiral Arm Sets in the Milky
  Way","The Milky Way spiral arm dynamics is studied using the birth place of open
clusters. We separately study the nearby spiral arms, and find evidence for
multiple spiral sets. In particular, the Sagittarius-Carina arm appears to be a
superposition of two sets. The first has a pattern speed of
Omega_P,Carina,1=16.5^{+1.2}_{-1.4sys}+/-1.1_{stat} (km/s)/kpc, while the
second has Omega_P,Carina,2=29.8^{+0.6}_{-1.3sys}+/-1.3_{stat} (km/s)/kpc. The
Perseus arm located at larger galactic radii exhibits only one clear set with
Omega_P,Perseus=20.0^{+1.7}_{-1.2sys}+/-1.6_{stat} (km/s)/kpc. The Perseus and
""slower"" Carina arms are most probably part of an m=4 set. The Orion ""armlet""
appears to have a pattern speed of Omega_P,Orion=28.9
^{+1.3}_{-1.2sys}+/-0.8_{stat} (km/s)/kpc. In other words, both the ""faster""
Carina arm and the Orion arm are nearly corotating with the solar system.",2005-03-06T13:08:40Z
Jet Formation in Black Hole Accretion Systems II: Numerical Models,"In a companion theory paper, we presented a unified model of jet formation.
We suggested that primarily two types of relativistic jets form near accreting
black holes: a potentially ultrarelativistic Poynting-dominated jet and a
Poynting-baryon jet. We showed that, for the collapsar model, the
neutrino-driven enthalpy flux (classic fireball model) is probably dominated by
the Blandford-Znajek energy flux, which predicts a jet Lorentz factor of
$\Gamma\sim 100-1000$. We showed that radiatively inefficient AGN, such as M87,
are synchrotron-cooling limited to $\Gamma\sim 2-10$. Radiatively efficient
x-ray binaries, such as GRS1915+105, are Compton-drag limited to $\Gamma
\lesssim 2$, but the jet may be destroyed by Compton drag. However, the
Poynting-baryon jet is a collimated outflow with $\Gamma \sim 1-3$. Here we
present general relativistic hydromagnetic simulations of black hole accretion
with pair creation used to simulate jet formation in GRBs, AGN, and x-ray
binaries. Our collapsar model shows the development of a patchy ``magnetic
fireball'' with typically $\Gamma\sim 100-1000$ and a Gaussian structure.
Temporal variability of the jet is dominated by toroidal field instabilities
for $\gtrsim 10^2$ gravitational radii. A broader Poynting-baryon jet with
$\Gamma\sim 1.5$ could contribute to a supernova.",2005-06-16T06:13:47Z
"Precision X-ray Timing of RX J0806.3+1527 with CHANDRA: Evidence for
  Gravitational Radiation from an Ultracompact Binary","RX J0806.3+1527 is a candidate double degenerate binary with possibly the
shortest known orbital period. The source shows an 100% X-ray intensity
modulation at the putative orbital frequency of 3.11 mHz (321.5 s). If the
system is a detached, ultracompact binary gravitational radiation should drive
spin-up with a magnitude of ~10-16 Hz/s. Here we describe the results of the
first phase coherent X-ray monitoring campaign on RX J0806.3+1527 with Chandra.
We obtained a total of 70 ksec of exposure in 6 epochs logarithmically spaced
over 320 days. These data conclusively show that the X-ray frequency is
increasing at a rate of 3.77 +- 0.8 x 10-16 Hz/s. Using our new ephemeris we
are able to phase up all the earlier Chandra and ROSAT data and show they are
consistent with a rate of 3.63 +- 0.06 x 10-16 Hz/s over the past decade. This
value appears consistent with that recently derived by Israel et al. largely
from monitoring of the optical modulation, and is in rough agreement with the
solutions reported initially by Hakala et al., based on ground-based optical
observations. The large spin-up is consistent with gravitational radiation
losses driving the evolution. An intermediate polar (IP) scenario where the
observed X-ray period is the spin period of an accreting white dwarf appears
less tenable. If the ultracompact scenario is correct, then the X-ray flux
cannot be powered by stable accretion which would drive the components apart,
suggesting a new type of energy source (perhaps electromagnetic) may power the
X-ray flux.",2005-04-06T13:42:08Z
Discovery of disc precession in the M31 dipping X-ray binary Bo 158,"We present results from three XMM-Newton observations of the M31 low mass
X-ray binary XMMU J004314.4+410726.3 (Bo 158), spaced over 3 days in 2004,
July. Bo 158 was the first dipping LMXB to be discovered in M31. Periodic
intensity dips were previously seen to occur on a 2.78-hr period, due to
absorption in material that is raised out of the plane of the accretion disc.
The report of these observations stated that the dip depth was anti-correlated
with source intensity. However, our new observations do not favour a strict
intensity dependance, but rather suggest that the dip variation is due to
precession of the accretion disc. This is to be expected in LMXBs with a mass
ratio <~ 0.3 (period <~ 4 hr), as the disc reaches the 3:1 resonance with the
binary companion, causing elongation and precession of the disc. A smoothed
particle hydrodynamics simulation of the disc in this system shows retrograde
rotation of a disc warp on a period of ~11 P_orb, and prograde disc precession
on a period of ~29 P_orb. This is consistent with the observed variation in the
depth of the dips. We find that the dipping behaviour is most likely to be
modified by the disc precession, hence we predict that the dipping behaviour
repeats on a 81+/-3 hr cycle.",2005-03-11T13:08:03Z
Polarized Diffuse Emission at 2.3 GHz in a High Galactic Latitude Area,"Polarized diffuse emission observations at 2.3 GHz in a high Galactic
latitude area are presented. The 2\degr X 2\degr field, centred in
(\alpha=5^h,\delta=-49\degr), is located in the region observed by the
BOOMERanG experiment. Our observations has been carried out with the Parkes
Radio telescope and represent the highest frequency detection done to date in
low emission areas. Because of a weaker Faraday rotation action, the high
frequency allows an estimate of the Galactic synchrotron contamination of the
Cosmic Microwave Background Polarization (CMBP) that is more reliable than that
done at 1.4 GHz. We find that the angular power spectra of the E- and B-modes
have slopes of \beta_E = -1.46 +/- 0.14 and \beta_B = -1.87 +/- 0.22,
indicating a flattening with respect to 1.4 GHz. Extrapolated up to 32 GHz, the
E-mode spectrum is about 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of the CMBP,
allowing a clean detection even at this frequency. The best improvement
concerns the B-mode, for which our single-dish observations provide the first
estimate of the contamination on angular scales close to the CMBP peak (about 2
degrees). We find that the CMBP B-mode should be stronger than synchrotron
contamination at 90 GHz for models with T/S > 0.01. This low level could move
down to 60-70 GHz the optimal window for CMBP measures.",2005-03-02T14:59:09Z
"Supernova Remnants in the Magellanic Clouds. V. The Complex Interior
  Structure of the N206 SNR","The N206 supernova remnant (SNR) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) has long
been considered a prototypical ""mixed morphology"" SNR. Recent observations,
however, have added a new twist to this familiar plot: an elongated,
radially-oriented radio feature seen in projection against the SNR face.
Utilizing the high resolution and sensitivity available with the Hubble Space
Telescope, Chandra, and XMM-Newton, we have obtained optical emission-line
images and spatially resolved X-ray spectral maps for this intriguing SNR. Our
findings present the SNR itself as a remnant in the mid to late stages of its
evolution. X-ray emission associated with the radio ""linear feature"" strongly
suggests it to be a pulsar-wind nebula (PWN). A small X-ray knot is discovered
at the outer tip of this feature. The feature's elongated morphology and the
surrounding wedge-shaped X-ray enhancement strongly suggest a bow-shock PWN
structure.",2005-04-27T17:53:55Z
High Energy Neutrinos from the TeV Blazar 1ES 1959+650,"The AMANDA neutrino telescope has recently reported the detection of
high-energy neutrinos spatially and temporally coincident with the flaring of
the TeV blazar 1ES 1959+650. At present, the statistical significance of this
observation cannot be reliably assessed, however. In this letter, we
investigate whether circumstances exist where the source can produce the flux
implied by the coincident events. We show that if the TeV gamma-ray emission
observed from 1ES 1959+650 or other nearby TeV blazars is the result of
accelerated protons interacting with nucleons, it is reasonable that AMANDA
could detect several events during a flaring period. Such rates require that
the spectral index of the source be rather high (for instance $\sim2.8$ for 1ES
1959+650) and that the Lorentz factor of the jet be fairly small ($\Gamma \sim
1$).",2005-02-22T11:54:17Z
The Classical Gravitational N-Body Problem,"Let a number, N, of particles interact classically through Newton's Laws of
Motion and Newton's inverse square Law of Gravitation. The resulting equations
of motion provide an approximate mathematical model with numerous applications
in astrophysics, including the motion of the moon and other bodies in the Solar
System (planets, asteroids, comets and meteor particles); stars in stellar
systems ranging from binary and other multiple stars to star clusters and
galaxies; and the motion of dark matter particles in cosmology. For N=1 and N=2
the equations can be solved analytically. The case N=3 provides one of the
richest of all unsolved dynamical problems -- the general three-body problem.
For problems dominated by one massive body, as in many planetary problems,
approximate methods based on perturbation expansions have been developed. In
stellar dynamics, astrophysicists have developed numerous numerical and
theoretical approaches to the problem for larger values of N, including
treatments based on the Boltzmann equation and the Fokker-Planck equation; such
N-body systems can also be modelled as self-gravitating gases, and
thermodynamic insights underpin much of our qualitative understanding.",2005-03-28T22:01:56Z
From Little Bangs to the Big Bang,"The `Little Bangs' made in particle collider experiments reproduce the
conditions in the Big Bang when the age of the Universe was a fraction of a
second. It is thought that matter was generated, the structures in the Universe
were formed and cold dark matter froze out during this very early epoch when
the equation of state of the Universe was dominated by the quark-gluon plasma
(QGP). Future Little Bangs may reveal the mechanism of matter generation and
the nature of cold dark matter. Knowledge of the QGP will be an essential
ingredient in quantitative understanding of the very early Universe.",2005-04-22T15:01:03Z
Forming a Primordial Star in a Relic HII Region,"There has been considerable theoretical debate over whether photoionization
and supernova feedback from the first Population III stars facilitate or
suppress the formation of the next generation of stars. We present results from
an Eulerian adaptive mesh refinement simulation demonstrating the formation of
a primordial star within a region ionized by an earlier nearby star. Despite
the higher temperatures of the ionized gas and its flow out of the dark matter
potential wells, this second star formed within 23 million years of its
neighbor's death. The enhanced electron fraction within the HII region
catalyzes rapid molecular hydrogen formation that leads to faster cooling in
the subsequent star forming halos than in the first halos. This ""second
generation"" primordial protostar has a much lower accretion rate because,
unlike the first protostar, it forms in a rotationally supported disk of
approx. 10-100 solar masses. This is primarily due to the much higher angular
momentum of the halo in which the second star forms. In contrast to previously
published scenarios, such configurations may allow binaries or multiple systems
of lower mass stars to form. These first high resolution calculations offer
insight into the impact of feedback upon subsequent populations of stars and
clearly demonstrate how primordial chemistry promotes the formation of
subsequent generations of stars even in the presence of the entropy injected by
the first stars into the IGM.",2005-03-15T23:32:48Z
Latitudinal Shear Instabilities during Type I X-ray Bursts,"Coherent oscillations have been observed during Type I X-ray bursts from 14
accreting neutron stars in low mass X-ray binaries, providing important
information about their spin frequencies. However, the origin of the brightness
asymmetry on the neutron star surface producing these oscillations is still not
understood. We study the stability of a zonal shearing flow on the neutron star
surface using a shallow water model. We show that differential rotation of >2%
between pole and equator, with the equator spinning faster than the poles, is
unstable to hydrodynamic shear instabilities. The unstable eigenmodes have
properties well-matched to burst oscillations: low azimuthal wavenumber m, wave
speeds 1 or 2% below the equatorial spin rate, and e-folding times close to a
second. Instability is related to low frequency buoyantly driven r-modes that
have a mode frequency within the range of rotation frequencies in the
differentially rotating shell. We discuss the implications for burst
oscillations. Growth of shear instabilities may explain the brightness
asymmetry in the tail of X-ray bursts, although some fine tuning of the level
of differential rotation and a spin frequency near 300 Hz are required in order
for the fastest growing mode to have m=1. If shear instabilities are to operate
during a burst, temperature contrasts of 30% across the star must be created
during ignition and spreading of the flash.",2005-05-04T03:49:12Z
The Detection of Silicate Emission from Quasars at 10 and 18 Microns,"We report the spectroscopic detection of silicate emission at 10 and 18
microns in five PG quasars, the first detection of these two features in
galaxies outside the Local Group. This finding is consistent with the
unification model for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), which predicts that an AGN
torus seen pole-on should show a silicate emission feature in the mid-infrared.
The strengths of the detected silicate emission features range from 0.12 to
1.25 times the continuum at 10 microns and from 0.20 to 0.79 times the
continuum at 18 microns. The silicate grain temperatures inferred from the
ratio of 18-to-10 micron silicate features under the assumption of optically
thin emission range from 140 to 220K.",2005-04-19T20:00:01Z
Is There a Microlensing Puzzle?,"Using neural networks, Belokurov, Evans & Le Du (2003, 2004) showed that 7
out of the 29 microlensing candidates towards the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)
of the MACHO collaboration are consistent with blended microlensing and added
Gaussian noise. They then estimated the microlensing optical depth to the LMC
to be between 0.3 x 10^{-7} and 0.5 x 10^{-7}, lower by about a factor of two
than that found by the MACHO collaboration. There has been a recent independent
claim of a low optical depth to the LMC by the EROS collaboration, who find
0.15 x 10^{-7} from 3 candidates (Tisserand et al 2006). Griest & Thomas (2005)
have contested our calculations. Unfortunately, their paper contains a number
of scientific misrepresentations of our work. We stand by our application of
neural networks to microlensing searches and believe it to be a technique of
great promise. Rather, the main cause of the disparity between Griest & Thomas
and Belokurov et al. lies in the very different datasets through which these
investigators look for microlensing events. We don't exclude the possibility
that some of our non-microlensing designations may change with access to clean
data. Whilst not everything is understood about the microlensing datasets
towards the LMC, the latest downward revisions of the optical depth means that
Griest & Thomas' microlensing puzzle is a roughly 1 sigma effect. Efficiency
calculations can correct for the effects of false negatives, but they cannot
correct for the effects of false positives (variable stars that are mistaken
for microlensing). Therefore, the best strategy in a microlensing experiment is
to eschew a decision boundary altogether. Rather, each lightcurve should be
assigned a probability and the microlensing rate calculated by summing over the
probabilities of all such lightcurves.",2005-05-09T11:29:59Z
Particle acceleration efficiencies in astrophysical shear flows,"The acceleration of energetic particles in astrophysical shear flows is
analyzed. We show that in the presence of a non-relativistic gradual velocity
shear, power law particle momentum distributions $f(p) \propto p^{-(3+\alpha)}$
may be generated, assuming a momentum-dependent scattering time $\tau \propto
p^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha > 0$. We consider possible acceleration sites in
astrophysical jets and study the conditions for efficient acceleration. It is
shown, for example, that in the presence of a gradual shear flow and a
gyro-dependent particle mean free path, synchrotron radiation losses no longer
stop the acceleration once it has started to work efficiently. This suggests
that shear acceleration may naturally account for a second, non-thermal
population of energetic particles in addition to a shock-accelerated one. The
possible relevance of shear acceleration is briefly discussed with reference to
the relativistic jet in the quasar 3C 273.",2005-02-04T11:46:14Z
Star formation in Perseus,"We present a complete survey of current star formation in the Perseus
molecular cloud, made at 850 and 450 micron with SCUBA at the JCMT. Covering 3
deg^2, this submillimetre continuum survey for protostellar activity is second
in size only to that of rho Ophiuchus (Johnstone et al. 2004). Complete above
0.4 msun (5 sigma detection in a 14'' beam), we detect a total of 91 protostars
and prestellar cores. Of these, 80% lie in clusters, representative of star
formation across the Galaxy. Two of the groups of cores are associated with the
young stellar clusters IC348 and NGC1333, and are consistent with a steady or
reduced star formation rate in the last 0.5 Myr, but not an increasing one. In
Perseus, 40--60% of cores are in small clusters (< 50 msun) and isolated
objects, much more than the 10% suggested from infrared studies. Complementing
the dust continuum, we present a C^18O map of the whole cloud at 1' resolution.
The gas and dust show filamentary structure of the dense gas on large and small
scales, with the high column density filaments breaking up into clusters of
cores. The filament mass per unit length is 5--11 msun per 0.1 pc. Given these
filament masses, there is no requirement for substantial large scale flows
along or onto the filaments in order to gather sufficient material for star
formation. We find that the probability of finding a submillimetre core is a
strongly increasing function of column density, as measured by C^18O integrated
intensity, prob(core) proportional to I^3.0. This power law relation holds down
to low column density, suggesting that there is no A_v threshold for star
formation in Perseus, unless all the low-A_v submm cores can be demonstrated to
be older protostars which have begun to lose their natal molecular cloud.",2005-05-20T15:12:03Z
Dip in UHECR spectrum as signature of proton interaction with CMB,"Ultrahigh energy (UHE) extragalactic protons propagating through cosmic
microwave radiation (CMB) acquire the spectrum features in the form of the dip,
bump (pile-up protons) and the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff. We have
performed the analysis of these features in terms of the modification factor.
This analysis is weakly model-dependent, especially in case of the dip. The
energy shape of the dip is confirmed by the Akeno-AGASA data with
$\chi^2=19.06$ for d.o.f. =17 with two free parameters used for comparison. The
agreement with HiRes data is also very good. This is the strong evidence that
UHE cosmic rays observed at energies $1\times 10^{18}$ eV - $4\times 10^{19}$
eV are extragalactic protons propagating through CMB. The dip is also present
in case of diffusive propagation in magnetic field.",2005-02-28T18:23:43Z
"The Century Survey Galactic Halo Project II: Global Properties and the
  Luminosity Function of Field Blue Horizontal Branch Stars","We discuss a 175 deg^2 spectroscopic survey for blue horizontal branch (BHB)
stars in the Galactic halo. We use the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to select BHB candidates, and find that the
2MASS and SDSS color-selection is 38% and 50% efficient, respectively, for BHB
stars. Our samples include one likely run-away B7 star 6 kpc below the Galactic
plane. The global properties of the BHB samples are consistent with membership
in the halo population: the median metallicity is [Fe/H]=-1.7, the velocity
dispersion is 108 km/s, and the mean Galactic rotation of the BHB stars
3<|z|<15 kpc is -4 +- 30 km/s. We discuss the theoretical basis of the Preston,
Shectman & Beers M_V-color relation for BHB stars, and conclude that intrinsic
shape of the BHB M_V-color relation results from the physics of stars on the
horizontal branch. We calculate the luminosity function for the field BHB star
samples using the Efstathiou, Ellis, & Peterson maximum-likelihood method which
is unbiased by density variations. The field BHB luminosity function exhibits a
steep rise at bright luminosities, a peak between 0.8 < M_V < 1.0, and a tail
at faint luminosities. We compare the field BHB luminosity functions with the
luminosity functions derived from sixteen different globular cluster BHBs.
Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests suggest that field BHB stars and BHB stars in globular
clusters share a common distribution of luminosities, with the exception of
globular clusters with extended BHBs.",2005-05-16T19:57:57Z
"Oxygen and neon abundances of planetary nebulae in the elliptical galaxy
  NGC 4697","This paper presents deep spectra of 14 planetary nebulae (PNs) at a variety
of angular distances from the center of the flattened elliptical galaxy NGC
4697. Both near the center and among the most outlying PNs we have found
several examples of very strong [O III] 5007, about 20 times brighter than
Hbeta. This, together with strong [Ne III] lines, implies a lower limit for O
and Ne abundances near solar at the center and also at more than two effective
radii from the center of NGC 4697. Thus we have found, for the first time from
individual stars, direct evidence of the existence of a metal-rich population
in elliptical galaxies, confirming metallicities derived from absorption-line
indices and extending the information to angular distances where the stellar
surface brightness is too low for absorption-line studies. A comparison with
abundances obtained closer to the center of NGC 4697 from integrated
absorption-line spectra indicates that the metallicity gradient, which is quite
steep within one effective radius, becomes much less pronounced beyond one
effective radius. The only alternative to this interpretation would be the
presence of a very metal-poor PN population with [Z/H] below -1, which we
cannot rule out but would require an extremely bimodal metallicity distribution
with almost no intermediate metallicities.",2005-03-29T05:00:41Z
"X-ray reflection in the Seyfert galaxy 1H0419-577 revealing strong
  relativistic effects in the vicinity of a Kerr black hole","We report results obtained from six XMM-Newton observations of the Seyfert
galaxy 1H 0419-577. Here we show that the X-ray spectrum and variability are
well described by a two-component model comprising a power law with constant
spectral shape and variable normalisation and a much more constant ionised
reflection component from the inner accretion. One of the observations was
performed when the source was in a particularly low flux state in which the
X-ray spectrum is rather peculiar and exhibits a very flat hard spectrum with
broad residuals below 6.6 keV and a steep soft excess below about 1 keV. We
interpret the spectrum as being reflection-dominated by X-ray reprocessed
emission from the inner accretion disc. The primary continuum is almost
completely unobserved possibly because of strong light bending towards the
central black hole. The ionised reflection model simultaneously accounts for
the broad residuals and hard flat spectrum and for the soft excess. The same
model provides an excellent description of the data at all the other flux
levels, the most important difference being a variation in the power law
normalisation. Our results imply that most of the X-ray emission in this source
originates from within few gravitational radii from the central black hole and
requires that the compact object is an almost maximally spinning Kerr black
hole. (abridged)",2005-04-21T15:03:32Z
New insights on the AU-scale circumstellar structure of FU Orionis,"We report new near-infrared, long-baseline interferometric observations at
the AU scale of the pre-main-sequence star FU Orionis with the PTI, IOTA and
VLTI interferometers. This young stellar object has been observed on 42 nights
over a period of 6 years from 1998 to 2003. We have obtained 287 independent
measurements of the fringe visibility with 6 different baselines ranging from
20 to 110 meters in length, in the H and K bands. Our extensive (u,v)-plane
coverage, coupled with the published spectral energy distribution data, allows
us to test the accretion disk scenario. We find that the most probable
explanation for these observations is that FU Ori hosts an active accretion
disk whose temperature law is consistent with standard models. We are able to
constrain the geometry of the disk, including an inclination of 55 deg and a
position angle of 47 deg. In addition, a 10 percent peak-to-peak oscillation is
detected in the data (at the two-sigma level) from the longest baselines, which
we interpret as a possible disk hot-spot or companion. However, the oscillation
in our best data set is best explained with an unresolved spot located at a
projected distance of 10 AU at the 130 deg position angle and with a magnitude
difference of DeltaK = 3.9 and DeltaH = 3.6 mag moving away from the center at
a rate of 1.2 AU/yr. we propose to interpret this spot as the signature of a
companion of the central FU Ori system on an extremely eccentric orbit. We
speculate that the close encounter of this putative companion and the central
star could be the explanation of the initial photometric rise of the luminosity
of this object.",2005-03-29T16:46:20Z
"The FWHM of local pulses and the corresponding power-law index of
  gamma-ray burst FRED pulses","The FWHM of gamma-ray burst (GRB) pulses is known to be related with energy
by a power-law. We wonder if the power-law index $\alpha$ is related with the
corresponding local pulse width $FWHM_0$. Seven FRED (fast rise and exponential
decay) pulse GRBs are employed to study this issue, where six of them were
interpreted recently by the relativistic curvature effect (the Doppler effect
of fireballs) and the corresponding local pulses were intensely studied. A
regression analysis shows an anti-correlation between $log \alpha$ and $log
FWHM_0$ with a slope of $-0.37\pm0.13$. This suggests that, for the class of
the GRB pulses which are consequences of the curvature effect, the difference
of the local pulse width might lead to the variation of the power law index,
where the smaller the width the larger the value of $\alpha$. Since the number
of sources employed in this analysis is small, our result is only a preliminary
one which needs to be confirmed by larger samples.",2005-05-14T15:19:47Z
"Microlensing optical depth toward the Galactic Bulge using bright
  sources from OGLE-II","We present a measurement of the microlensing optical depth toward the
Galactic Bulge based on 4 years of the OGLE-II survey using Red Clump Giant
(RCG). Using 32 events we find tau=2.55_{-0.46}^{+0.57}* 10^{-6} at
(l,b)=(1.16, -2.75). Taking into account the measured gradient along the
Galactic latitude b, tau = [ (4.48+/- 2.37) + (0.78+/- 0.84)* b]* 10^{-6}, this
value is consistent with previous measurements using RCG sources and recent
theoretical predictions. We determine the microlensing parameters and select
events using a model light curve with the flux blending. We find that ~38% of
the OGLE-II events which appear to have RCG sources are actually due to much
fainter stars blended with a bright companion. We show explicitly that model
fits without blending result in similar tau estimates through partial
cancellation of contributions from higher detection efficiency, underestimated
time-scales and larger number of selected events. This approach, however, leads
to biased time-scale distributions and event rates. Consequently, microlensing
studies should carefully consider source confusion effects even for bright
stars.",2005-02-17T21:32:06Z
Can we escape from the big rip in the achronal cosmic future?,"Recently Pedro F. Gonzalez-Diaz had shown that phantom energy can results in
achronal cosmic future where the wormholes become infinite before the
occurrence of the big rip singularity. After that, while the phantom energy
continues its accretion, any wormhole becomes the Einstein-Rosen bridge. Pedro
F. Gonzalez-Diaz has suggested that such objects can be used by an advanced
civilization as the means of escape from the big rip. Using the Bekenstein
Bound we'll show that it is impossible due to the very strong upper bound laid
on the total amount of information which can be sent through this bridge.",2005-03-20T19:30:54Z
The Redshift-Space Two Point Correlation Function of ELAIS-S1 Galaxies,"We investigate the clustering properties of galaxies in the recently
completed ELAIS-S1 redshift survey through their spatial two point
autocorrelation function. We used a sub-sample of the ELAIS-S1 catalog covering
approximately 4 deg^2 and consisting of 148 objects selected at 15 micron with
a flux >0.5 mJy and redshift z<0.5. We detected a positive signal in the
correlation function that, in the range of separations 1-10 h mpc is well
approximated by a power law with a slope gamma = 1.4 and a correlation length s
=5.4 h mpc. This result is in good agreement with the redshift-space
correlation function measured in more local samples of mid infrared selected
galaxies like the IRAS PSC$z$ redshift survey. This suggests a lack of
significant clustering evolution of infrared selected objects out to $z=0.5$
that is further confirmed by the consistency found between the correlation
functions measured in a local (z<0.2) and a distant (0.2<z<0.5) subsample of
ELAIS-S1 galaxies. We also confirm that optically selected galaxies in the
local redshift surveys, especially those of the SDSS sample, are significantly
more clustered than infrared objects.",2005-03-11T12:04:11Z
"Neural Networks as a Composition Diagnostic for Ultra-high Energy Cosmic
  Rays","We analyze here the possibility of studying mass composition in the Auger
data sample using neural networks as a diagnostic tool. Extensive air showers
were simulated using the AIRES code, for the two hadronic interaction models in
current use: QGSJet and Sibyll. Both, photon and hadron primaries were
simulated and used to generate events. The output parameters from the ground
array were simulated for the typical instrumental and environmental conditions
at the Malarg\""ue Auger site using the code SAMPLE. Besides photons, hydrogen,
helium, carbon, oxygen, magnesium, silicon, calcium and iron nuclei were also
simulated. We show that Principal Components Analysis alone is enough to
separate individual photon from hadron events, but the same technique cannot be
applied to the classification of hadronic events. The latter requires the use
of a more robust diagnostic. We show that neural networks are potentially
powerful enough to discriminate proton from iron events almost on an
event-by-event basis. However, in the case of a more realistic multi-component
mixture of primary nuclei, only a statistical estimate of the average mass can
be reliably obtained. Although hybrid events are not explicitly simulated, we
show that, whenever hybrid information in the form of $X_{max}$ is introduced
in the training procedure of the neural networks, a considerable improvement
can be achieved in mass discrimination analysis.",2005-02-13T14:13:44Z
"A Resonance Model of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations of Low-Mass X-Ray
  Binaries","We try to understand the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in low-mass
neutron-star and black-hole X-ray binaries by a resonance model in warped disks
with precession. Our main concern is high-frequency QPOs, hectohertz QPOs, and
horizontal-branch QPOs in the z sources and the atoll sources, and the
correponding QPOs in black-hole X-ray binaries. Our resonance model can
qualitatively, but systematically, explain these QPOs by regarding hectohertz
QPOs as a precession of warp.",2005-05-11T00:29:55Z
Possible hot spots excited by the relativistic jets of Cygnus X-3,"We present the results of a deep search for associated radio features in the
vicinity of the microquasar Cygnus X-3. The motivation behind is to find out
evidence for interaction between its relativistic jets and the surrounding
interstellar medium, which could eventually allow us to perform calorimetry of
the total energy released by this microquasar during its flaring lifetime.
Remarkably, two radio sources with mJy emission level at centimeter wavelengths
have been detected in excellent alignment with the position angle of the inner
radio jets. We propose that these objects could be the hot spots where the
relativitic outflow collides with the ambient gas in analogy with
Fanaroff-Riley II radio galaxies. These candidate hot spots are within a few
arc-minutes of Cygnus X-3 and, if physically related, the full linear extent of
the jet would reach tens of parsecs. We discuss here the evidence currently
available to support this hypothesis based on both archival data and our own
observations.",2005-05-20T09:29:19Z
An old quasar in a young dark energy-dominated universe?,"Dark energy is the invisible fuel that seems to drive the current
acceleration of the Universe. Its presence, which is inferred from an
impressive convergence of high-quality observational results along with some
apparently sucessful theoretical predictions, is also supported by the current
estimates of the age of the Universe from dating of local and high-$z$ objects.
In this paper we test the viability of several dark energy scenarios in the
light of the age estimates of the high redshift ($z=3.91$) quasar APM
08279+5255. Using a chemodinamical model for the evolution of spheroids, we
first reevaluate its current estimated age, as given by Hasinger et al. (2002).
An age of 2.1 Gyr is set by the condition that Fe/O abundance ratio (normalized
to solar values) of the model reaches 3.3, which is the best fit value obtained
in the above reference. It is shown that for the currently accepted value of
the matter density parameter, most of the existing dark energy scenarios cannot
accomodate this old high redshift object unless the Hubble parameter is as low
as $H_o = 58$ $\rm{km.s^{-1}.Mpc^{-1}}$, as recently advocated by Sandage and
collaborators. Even considering less stringent age limits, only cosmological
models that predicts a considerably old Universe at high-$z$ can be compatible
with the existence of this object. This is the case of the conventional
$\Lambda$CDM scenario and some specific classes of brane world cosmologies.",2005-04-01T17:47:50Z
"Characterizing a new class of variability in GRS 1915+105 with
  simultaneous INTEGRAL/RXTE observations","We report on the analysis of 100 ks INTEGRAL observations of the Galactic
microquasar GRS 1915+105. We focus on INTEGRAL Revolution number 48 when the
source was found to exhibit a new type of variability as preliminarily reported
in Hannikainen et al. (2003). The variability pattern, which we name $\xi$, is
characterized by a pulsing behaviour, consisting of a main pulse and a shorter,
softer, and smaller amplitude precursor pulse, on a timescale of 5 minutes in
the JEM-X 3-35 keV lightcurve. We also present simultaneous RXTE data. From a
study of the individual RXTE/PCA pulse profiles we find that the rising phase
is shorter and harder than the declining phase, which is opposite to what has
been observed in other otherwise similar variability classes in this source.
The position in the colour-colour diagram throughout the revolution corresponds
to State A (Belloni et al. 2000) but not to any previously known variability
class. We separated the INTEGRAL data into two subsets covering the maxima and
minima of the pulses and fitted the resulting two broadband spectra with a
hybrid thermal--non-thermal Comptonization model. The fits show the source to
be in a soft state characterized by a strong disc component below ~6 keV and
Comptonization by both thermal and non-thermal electrons at higher energies.",2005-02-22T02:58:43Z
On the excitation of PG1159-type pulsations,"Stability properties are presented of dipole and quadrupole nonradial
oscillation modes of model stars that experienced a late helium shell flash on
their way to the white-dwarf cooling domain. The computed instability domains
are compared with the observed hot variable central stars of planetary nebulae
and the GW Vir pulsators.",2005-04-22T09:24:15Z
Revealing the Supernova--Gamma-Ray Burst Connection with TeV Neutrinos,"Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are rare but powerful explosions displaying highly
relativistic jets. It has been suggested that a significant fraction of the
much more frequent core-collapse supernovae are accompanied by comparably
energetic but mildly relativistic jets, which would indicate an underlying
supernova--GRB connection. We calculate the neutrino spectra from the decays of
pions and kaons produced in jets in supernovae, and show that the kaon
contribution is dominant and provides a sharp break near 20 TeV, which is a
sensitive probe of the conditions inside the jet. For a supernova at 10 Mpc, 30
events above 100 GeV are expected in a 10 s burst in the IceCube detector.",2005-02-24T20:37:03Z
"Nonlinear Perpendicular Diffusion in Strong Turbulent Electromagnetic
  Fields","A nonlinear description for perpendicular particle diffusion in strong
electromagnetic fluctuations is developed by using the fundamental
Newton-Lorentz equation. Although not based on the same approach, the recently
presented nonlinear guiding center (NLGC) theory is recovered as a special
case. The approach used here is rather based on the argument that a well
defined particle gyromotion does not exist in strong fluctuations than on the
assumption that the particle gyrocenter follows magnetic field lines which
themselves separate diffusively. The assumption of a guiding center motion and
the diffusive separation of magnetic field lines is absolutely central to the
NLGC theory. It is argued that the NLGC result should provide most accurate
results for strong fluctuations. Furthermore, as a direct consequence of the
particle equation of motion, it is shown that particle diffusion in one
perpendicular direction is governed by the fluctuations in the other normal
direction. This results contradicts the NLGC result, where perpendicular
diffusion is triggered by fluctuations in the same direction. This is of
particular interest for anisotropic perpendicular diffusion in a
non-axisymmetric turbulence. Future numerical simulation results for
non-axisymmetric magnetic turbulence and their comparison with the approach
presented here and the NLGC theory have to provide an answer whether particle
diffusion in one perpendicular direction is governed by the fluctuations in the
other normal direction or by fluctuations in the same direction.",2005-02-23T08:11:14Z
"Dry Mergers in GEMS: The Dynamical Evolution of Massive Early-Type
  Galaxies","We have used the 28'x 28' HST image mosaic from the GEMS (Galaxy Evolution
from Morphology and SEDs) survey in conjunction with the COMBO-17 photometric
redshift survey to constrain the incidence of major mergers between
spheroid-dominated galaxies with little cold gas (dry mergers) since z = 0.7. A
set of N-body merger simulations was used to explore the morphological
signatures of such interactions: they are recognizable either as < 5kpc
separation close pairs or because of broad, low surface brightness tidal
features and asymmetries. Data with the depth and resolution of GEMS are
sensitive to dry mergers between galaxies with M_V < -20.5 for z < 0.7; dry
mergers at higher redshifts are not easily recovered in single-orbit HST
imaging. Six dry mergers (12 galaxies) with luminosity ratios between 1:1 and
4:1 were found from a sample of 379 red early-type galaxies with M_V < -20.5
and 0.1 < z < 0.7. The simulations suggest that the morphological signatures of
dry merging are visible for ~250Myr and we use this timescale to convert the
observed merger incidence into a rate. On this basis we find that present day
spheroidal galaxies with M_V < -20.5 on average have undergone between 0.5 and
2 major dry mergers since z ~ 0.7. We have compared this result with the
predictions of a Cold Dark Matter based semi-analytic galaxy formation model.
The model reproduces the observed declining major merger fraction of bright
galaxies and the space density of luminous early-type galaxies reasonably well.
The predicted dry merger fraction is consistent with our observational result.
Hence, hierarchical models predict and observations now show that major dry
mergers are an important driver of the evolution of massive early-type galaxies
in recent epochs.",2005-06-17T20:46:17Z
"Evaporation and Condensation of HI clouds in thermally bistable
  interstellar media: semi-analytic description of isobaric dynamics of curved
  interfaces","We analyze the evaporation and condensation of spherical and cylindrical HI
clouds of the cold neutral medium surrounded by the warm neutral medium.
Because the interstellar medium including those two phases is well described as
a thermally bistable fluid, it is useful to apply pattern formation theories to
the dynamics of the interface between the two phases. Assuming isobaric
evolution of fluids and a simple cubic form of the heat-loss function, we show
the curvature effects of the interface. We find that approximate solutions for
spherical clouds are in good agreement with numerically obtained solutions. We
extend our analysis to general curved fronts taking into account the curvature
effects explicitly. We find that the curvature effects always stabilise curved
interfaces under assumptions such as isobaric evolution we adopt in this
Letter.",2005-03-07T11:36:17Z
Radio Spectral Index Variations of the SNR HB3,"We present images of the SNR HB3 at both 408 MHz and 1420 MHz from the
Canadian Galactic Plane Survey mainly based on data from the Synthesis
Telescope of the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory. We reproduce the
100m-Effelsberg HB3 image at 2695 MHz at large scale, and find that there
exists a background emission gradient across the HB3 area. Based on our
analysis of background emission and the boundary between W3 and HB3, we give
HB3's flux density as 68.6 +/- 11.5 Jy at 408 MHz and 44.8 +/- 12.0 Jy at 1420
MHz, after subtracting flux from compact sources within HB3. The integrated
flux-density-based spectral index between 408 MHz and 1420 MHz is 0.34 +/-
0.15. The averaged T-T plot spectral index using all subareas is 0.36. Our
measurement values are less than a previously published value of 0.6. The
408-1420 MHz spectral index varies spatially in HB3 in the range 0.1 to 0.7. We
investigate the data used by previous authors, and consider more data at 232
MHz, 3650 MHz and 3900 MHz which are not included in previous calculations.
There is evidence for two spectral indices for HB3 in the radio band, i.e.,
0.63 (38 - 610 MHz) and 0.32 (408 - 3900 MHz). This is consistent with the
spatial variations: the low frequency data mainly reflects the steeper indices
and the high frequency data mainly reflects the flatter indices.",2005-04-13T17:36:39Z
The excitation of water in the S140 photon dominated region,"We consider the excitation of water in the Photon Dominated Region (PDR).
With the use of a three-dimensional escape probability method we compute the
level populations of ortho- and para-H_2O up to 350 K (i.e., 8 levels), as well
as line intensities for various transitions. Homogeneous and inhomogeneous
models are presented with densities of 10^4-10^5 cm^{-3} and the differences
between the resulting intensities are displayed. Density, temperature, and
abundance distributions inside the cloud are computed with the use of a
self-consistent physi-chemical (in)homogeneous model in order to reproduce the
line intensities observed with SWAS, and to make predictions for various lines
that HIFI will probe in the future. Line intensities vary from 10^{-13} erg
cm^{-2} s^{-1} sr^{-1} to a few times 10^{-6} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} sr^{-1}. We
can reproduce the intensity for the 1_{10}-1_{01} line observed by the SWAS
satellite. It is found that the 2_{12}-1_{01} line is the strongest, whereas
the 3_{12}-2_{21} line is the weakest, in all the models. It is found that the
1_{10}-1_{01} line probes the total column, while higher excitation lines probe
the higher density gas (e.g., clumps).",2005-06-06T15:26:39Z
"Multiwavelength Observations and State Transitions of an Ultra-luminous
  Supersoft X-ray Source: Evidence for an Intermediate-Mass Black Hole","We report the results of Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of an
ultra-luminous supersoft X-ray source in M101. M101 ULX-1 underwent 2 outbursts
in 2004 during which the peak bolometric luminosities reached 1e41 erg/s. The
outburst spectra were very soft and can generally be fitted with a blackbody
model with temperatures of 50-160 eV. In two of the observations, absorption
edges at 0.33 keV, 0.56 keV, 0.66 keV, and 0.88 keV were found. A cool
accretion disk was also found in the 2004 December outburst. During the low
luminosity state, a power-law tail was seen up to 7 keV. It is clear the source
changed from a low/hard state to a high/soft state. In addition, it showed at
least 5 outbursts between 1996 and 2004. This is the first ultra-luminous X-ray
source for which recurrent outbursts with state transitions similar to Galactic
X-ray binaries have been observed. From the Hubble Space Telescope data, we
found an optical counterpart to the source. During the 2004 outbursts, we also
performed radio and ground-based optical observations. All the results strongly
suggest that the accreting object is a > 2800 solar mass black hole.",2005-03-22T03:59:03Z
Evidence for Planet-Planet Scattering in Upsilon Andromedae,"Doppler spectroscopy has detected 136 planets around nearby stars. A major
puzzle is why their orbits are highly eccentric, while all planets in our Solar
System are on nearly circular orbits, as expected if they formed by accretion
processes in a protostellar disk. Several mechanisms have been proposed to
generate large eccentricities after planet formation, but so far there has been
little observational evidence to support any particular one. Here we report
that the current orbital configuration of the three giant planets around
Upsilon Andromedae (ups And) provides evidence for a close dynamical
interaction with another planet, now lost from the system. The planets started
on nearly circular orbits, but chaotic evolution caused the outer planet (ups
And d) to be perturbed suddenly into a higher-eccentricity orbit. The coupled
evolution of the system then causes slow periodic variations in the
eccentricity of the middle planet (ups And c). Indeed, we show that ups And c
periodically returns to a very nearly circular state every 9000 years. Our
analysis shows that strong planet-planet scattering, one of several mechanisms
previously discussed for increasing orbital eccentricities, must have operated
in this system.",2005-02-22T06:46:18Z
Intrinsic Curvature in the X-ray Spectra of BL Lacertae Objects,"We report results from {\it XMM-Newton} observations of thirteen X-ray bright
BL Lacertae objects, selected from the {\it Einstein} Slew Survey sample. The
survey was designed to look for evidence of departures of the X-ray spectra
from a simple power law shape (i.e., curvature and/or line features), and to
find objects worthy of deeper study. Our data are generally well fit by
power-law models, with three cases having hard ($\Gamma<2; dN/dE \propto
E^{-\Gamma}$) spectra that indicate synchrotron peaks at $E \gsim 5$ keV.
Previous data had suggested a presence of absorption features in the X-ray
spectra of some BL Lacs. In contrast, none of these spectra show convincing
examples of line features, either in absorption or emission, suggesting that
such features are rare amongst BL Lacs, or, more likely, artifacts caused by
instrumental effects. We find significant evidence for intrinsic curvature
(steepening by $d\Gamma / d({\rm log} E) = 0.4 \pm 0.15$) in fourteen of the
seventeen X-ray spectra. This cannot be explained satisfactorily via excess
absorption, since the curvature is essentially constant from $0.5-6$ keV, an
observation which is inconsistent with the modest amounts of absorption that
would be required. We use the {\it XMM-Newton} Optical Monitor data with
concurrent radio monitoring to derive broadband spectral energy distributions
and peak frequency estimates. From these we examine models of synchrotron
emission and model the spectral curvature we see as the result of episodic
particle acceleration.",2005-02-15T17:12:54Z
"Nuclear Properties of Nearby Spiral Galaxies from Hubble Space Telescope
  NICMOS imaging and STIS Spectroscopy","We investigate the central regions of 23 spiral galaxies using archival
NICMOS imaging and STIS spectroscopy. The sample is taken from our program to
determine the masses of central massive black holes (MBH) in 54 nearby spiral
galaxies. Stars are likely to contribute significantly to any dynamical central
mass concentration that we find in our MBH program and this paper is part of a
series to investigate the nuclear properties of these galaxies. We use the
Nuker law to fit surface brightness profiles, derived from the NICMOS images,
to look for nuclear star clusters and find possible extended sources in 3 of
the 23 galaxies studied (13 per cent). The fact that this fraction is lower
than that inferred from optical Hubble Space Telescope studies is probably due
to the greater spatial resolution of those studies. Using R-H and J-H colors
and equivalent widths of H-alpha emission (from the STIS spectra) we
investigate the nature of the stellar population with evolutionary models.
Under the assumption of hot stars ionizing the gas, as opposed to a weak AGN,
we find that there are young stellar populations (~10-20 Myr) however these
data do not allow us to determine what percentage of the total nuclear stellar
population they form. Also, in an attempt to find any unknown AGN we use [N II]
and [S II] line flux ratios (relative to H-alpha) and find tentative evidence
for weak AGN in NGC 1300 and NGC 4536.",2005-03-31T12:22:12Z
Unusual high-redshift radio BAL quasar 1624+3758,"We present observations of the most radio-luminous BAL quasar known,
1624+3758, at redshift z = 3.377. The quasar has several unusual properties:
(1) The FeII UV191 1787-A emission line is very prominent. (2) The BAL trough
(BALnicity index 2990 km/s) is detached by 21000 km/s and extends to velocity v
= -29000 km/s. There are additional intrinsic absorbers at -1900 and -2800
km/s. (3) The radio rotation measure of the quasar, 18350 rad/m^2, is the
second-highest known.
  The radio luminosity is P(1.4GHz) = 4.3 x 10^27 W/Hz (H0 = 50 km/s/Mpc, q0 =
0.5), radio loudness R* = 260. The radio source is compact (<~ 2.8 kpc) and the
radio spectrum is GHz-peaked, consistent with it being relatively young. The
width of the CIV emission line, in conjunction with the total optical
luminosity, implies black-hole mass ~ 10^9 M(sun), L/L(Eddington) ~ 2. The high
Eddington ratio, and the radio-loudness, place this quasar in one corner of
Boroson's (2002) 2-component scheme for the classification of AGN, implying a
very high accretion rate, and this may account for some of the unusual observed
properties.
  A complex mini-BAL absorber at v = -3000 km/s is detected in each of CIV, NV
and OVI. The blue and red components of the CIV doublet happen to be unblended,
allowing both the covering factor and optical depth to be determined as a
function of velocity. Variation of covering factor with velocity dominates the
form of the mini-BAL...",2005-04-22T15:29:33Z
Convective Dynamos and the Minimum X-ray Flux in Main Sequence Stars,"The objective of this paper is to investigate whether a convective dynamo can
account quantitatively for the observed lower limit of X-ray surface flux in
solar-type main sequence stars. Our approach is to use 3D numerical simulations
of a turbulent dynamo driven by convection to characterize the dynamic
behavior, magnetic field strengths, and filling factors in a non-rotating
stratified medium, and to predict these magnetic properties at the surface of
cool stars. We use simple applications of stellar structure theory for the
convective envelopes of main-sequence stars to scale our simulations to the
outer layers of stars in the F0--M0 spectral range, which allows us to estimate
the unsigned magnetic flux on the surface of non-rotating reference stars. With
these estimates we use the recent results of \citet{Pevtsov03} to predict the
level of X-ray emission from such a turbulent dynamo, and find that our results
compare well with observed lower limits of surface X-ray flux. If we scale our
predicted X-ray fluxes to \ion{Mg}{2} fluxes we also find good agreement with
the observed lower limit of chromospheric emission in K dwarfs. This suggests
that dynamo action from a convecting, non-rotating plasma is a viable
alternative to acoustic heating models as an explanation for the basal emission
level seen in chromospheric, transition region, and coronal diagnostics from
late-type stars.",2005-06-01T18:49:08Z
Observations of Mkn 421 in 2004 with H.E.S.S. at large zenith angles,"Mkn 421 was observed during a high flux state for nine nights in April and
May 2004 with the fully operational High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.)
in Namibia. The observations were carried out at zenith angles of
60$^\circ$--65$^\circ$, which result in an average energy threshold of 1.5 TeV
and a collection area reaching 2~km$^2$ at 10~TeV. Roughly 7000 photons from
Mkn~421 were accumulated with an average gamma-ray rate of 8 photons/min. The
overall significance of the detection exceeds 100 standard deviations. The
light-curve of integrated fluxes above 2~TeV shows changes of the diurnal flux
up to a factor of 4.3. For nights of high flux, intra-night variability is
detected with a decay time of less than 1 hour. The time averaged energy
spectrum is curved and is well described by a power-law with a photon index
$\egamm$ and an exponential cutoff at $\ecut$~TeV and an average integral flux
above 2~TeV of 3 Crab flux units. Significant variations of the spectral shape
are detected with a spectral hardening as the flux increases. Contemporaneous
multi-wavelength observations at lower energies (X-rays and gamma-rays above
$\approx 300$~GeV) indicate smaller relative variability amplitudes than seen
above 2~TeV during high flux state observed in April 2004.",2005-06-14T20:00:06Z
Magnetars,"Ultramagnetized neutron stars or magnetars are magnetically powered neutron
stars. Their strong magnetic fields dominate the physical processes in their
crusts and their surroundings. The past few years have seen several advances in
our theoretical and observational understanding of these objects. In spite of a
surfeit of observations, their spectra are still poorly understood. I will
discuss the emission from strongly magnetized condensed matter surfaces of
neutron stars, recent advances in our expectations of the surface composition
of magnetars and a model for the non-thermal emission from these objects.",2005-04-04T18:45:39Z
Gravitational Lensing of Distant Supernovae,"We use a series of ray-tracing experiments to determine the magnification
distribution of high-redshift sources by gravitational lensing. We determine
empirically the relation between magnification and redshift, for various
cosmological models. We then use this relation to estimate the effect of
lensing on the determination of the cosmological parameters from observations
of high-z supernovae. We found that, for supernovae at redshifts z<1.8, the
effect of lensing is negligible compared to the intrinsic uncertainty in the
measurements. Using mock data in the range 1.8<z<8, we show that the effect of
lensing can become significant. Hence, if a population of very-high-z
supernovae was ever discovered, it would be crucial to fully understand the
effect of lensing, before these SNe could be used to constrain cosmological
models.",2005-03-21T16:46:08Z
"Galactic Wind Shells and High Redshift Radio Galaxies On the Nature of
  Associated Absorbers","A jet is simulated on the background of a galactic wind headed by a radiative
bow shock. The wind shell, which is due to the radiative bow shock, is
effectively destroyed by the impact of the jet cocoon, thanks to
Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. Associated strong HI absorption, and possibly
also molecular emission, in high redshift radio galaxies which is observed
preferentially in the smaller ones may be explained by that model, which is an
improvement of an earlier radiative bow shock model. The model requires
temperatures of $\approx 10^6$ K in the proto-clusters hosting these objects,
and may be tested by high resolution spectroscopy of the Ly$\alpha$ line. The
simulations show that -- before destruction -- the jet cocoon fills the wind
shell entirely for a considerable time with intact absorption system.
Therefore, radio imaging of sources smaller than the critical size should
reveal the round central bubbles, if the model is correct.",2005-03-15T18:33:23Z
Confinement of supernova explosions in a collapsing cloud,"We analyze the confining effect of cloud collapse on an expanding supernova
shockfront. We solve the differential equation for the forces on the shockfront
due to ram pressure, supernova energy, and gravity. We find that the expansion
of the shockfront is slowed and in fact reversed by the collapsing cloud.
Including radiative losses and a potential time lag between supernova explosion
and cloud collapse shows that the expansion is reversed at smaller distances as
compared to the non-radiative case. We also consider the case of multiple
supernova explosions at the center of a collapsing cloud. For instance, if we
scale our self-similar solution to a single supernova of energy 10^51 ergs
occurring when a cloud of initial density 10^2 H/cm^3 has collapsed by 50%, we
find that the shockfront is confined to ~15 pc in ~1 Myrs. Our calculations are
pertinent to the observed unusually compact non-thermal radio emission in blue
compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs). More generally, we demonstrate the potential of
a collapsing cloud to confine supernovae, thereby explaining how dwarf galaxies
would exist beyond their first generation of star formation.",2005-05-13T19:59:55Z
"On the He II Emission In Eta Carinae and the Origin of Its Spectroscopic
  Events","We describe and analyze Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of
transient emission near 4680 {\AA} in Eta Car, reported earlier by Steiner &
Damineli (2004). If, as seems probable, this is He II $\lambda$4687, then it is
a unique clue to Eta Car's 5.5-year cycle. According to our analysis, several
aspects of this feature support a mass-ejection model of the observed
spectroscopic events, and not an eclipse model. The He II emission appeared in
early 2003, grew to a brief maximum during the 2003.5 spectroscopic event, and
then abruptly disappeared. It did not appear in any other HST spectra before or
after the event. The peak brightness was larger than previously reported, and
is difficult to explain even if one allows for an uncertainty factor of order
3. The stellar wind must provide a temporary larger-than-normal energy supply,
and we describe a special form of radiative amplification that may also be
needed. These characteristics are consistent with a class of mass-ejection or
wind-disturbance scenarios, which have implications for the physical structure
and stability of Eta Car.",2005-04-06T17:49:50Z
Comment on non-Gaussianity in hybrid inflation,"In the literature there have been incompatible estimates for the amount of
non-Gaussianity in hybrid inflation. In this note we point out the sources for
the discrepancies and show that the results for the amount of non-Gaussianity
in hybrid inflation obtained by two different methods, namely, perturbing
Einstein equation to second order and the separate universe approach, indeed
are compatible. This provides confidence in the methods themselves and in the
actual computation of non-Gaussianities.",2005-06-14T16:36:47Z
The Galex Ultraviolet Variability (GUVV) Catalog,"We present Version 1.0 of the NASA Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX)
ultraviolet variability catalog (GUVV) that contains information on 84
time-variable and transient sources gained with simultaneous near and far
ultraviolet photometric observations. These time-variable sources were
serendipitously revealed in the various 1.2 degree star fields currently being
surveyed by the GALEX satellite in two ultraviolet bands (NUV 1750-2750A, FUV
1350-1750A) with limiting AB magnitudes of 23-25. The largest-amplitude
variable objects presently detected by GALEX are M-dwarf flare stars, which can
brighten by 5-10 mag in both the NUV and FUV bands during short duration (<
500s) outbursts. Other types of large-amplitude ultraviolet variable objects
include ab-type RR Lyrae stars, which can vary periodically by 2-5mag in the
GALEX FUV band. This first GUVV catalog lists galactic positions and possible
source identifications in order to provide the astronomical community with a
list of time-variable objects that can now be repeatedly observed at other
wavelengths. We expect the total number of time-variable source detections to
increase as the GALEX mission progresses, such that later version numbers of
the GUVV catalog will contain substantially more variable sources.",2005-04-21T21:57:27Z
The need for small-scale turbulence in atmospheres of substellar objects,"Brown dwarfs and giant gas planets are substellar objects whose spectral
appearance is determined by the chemical composition of the gas and the
solids/liquids in the atmosphere. Atmospheres of substellar objects possess two
major scale regimes: large-scale convective motions + gravitational settling
and small-scale turbulence + dust formation. Turbulence initiates dust
formation spot-like on small scale, while the dust feeds back into the
turbulent fluid field by its strong radiative cooling. Small, imploding dust
containing areas result which eventually become isothermal. Multi-dimensional
simulations show that these small-scale dust structures gather into large-scale
structures, suggesting the formation of clouds made of dirty dust grains. The
chemical composition of the grains, and thereby the chemical evolution of the
gas phase, is a function of temperature and depends on the grain's history.",2005-06-09T13:54:28Z
"Precision of Inflaton Potential Reconstruction from CMB Using the
  General Slow-Roll Approximation","Through a principal component analysis, we study how accurately CMB
observables can constrain inflaton potentials in a model independent manner. We
apply the general slow-roll approximation in our analysis where we allow, in
contrast to the standard slow-roll approximation, the possibility of variations
in $V''(\phi)$ and take into account the fact that horizon crossing is not an
instantaneous event. Our analysis provides a set of modes to be used in fitting
observables. We find that of order five of these modes will be constrained by
future observations, so a fully general data analysis package could use the
amplitudes of just a handful of modes as free parameters and retain all
relevant information in the data.",2005-05-09T02:42:43Z
A simple model for the complex lag structure of microquasars,"The phase lag structure between the hard and soft X-ray photons observed in
GRS 1915+105 and XTE J1550+564 has been said to be ``complex'' because the
phase of the Quasi-Periodic Oscillation fundamental Fourier mode changes with
time and because the even and odd harmonics signs behave differentely.
  From simultaneous X-ray and radio observations this seems to be related to
the presence of a jet (level of radio emission). We propose a simple idea where
a partial absorption of the signal can shift the phases of the Fourier modes
and account for the phase lag reversal. We also briefly discuss a possible
physical mechanism that could lead to such an absorption of the quasi-periodic
oscillation modulation.",2005-02-14T16:47:55Z
Probing 3-D matter distribution at z~2 with QSO multiple lines of sight,"We investigate the 3-D matter distribution at z~2 with high resolution (R ~
40000) spectra of QSO pairs and groups obtained with the UVES spectrograph at
ESO VLT. Our sample is unique for the number density of objects and the variety
of separations, between 0.5 and 7 proper Mpc. We compute the real space
cross-correlation function of the Lyman-alpha forest transmitted fluxes. There
is a significant clustering signal up to ~2 proper Mpc, which is still present
when absorption lines with high column density (log N > 13.8) are excluded.",2005-06-09T09:31:29Z
"Spectrum and amplitudes of internal gravity waves excited by penetrative
  convection in solar-type stars","The excitation of internal gravity waves by penetrative convective plumes is
investigated using 2-D direct simulations of compressible convection. The wave
generation is quantitatively studied from the linear response of the radiative
zone to the plumes penetration, using projections onto the g-modes solutions of
the associated linear eigenvalue problem for the perturbations. This allows an
accurate determination of both the spectrum and amplitudes of the
stochastically excited modes. Using time-frequency diagrams of the mode
amplitudes, we then show that the lifetime of a mode is around twice its period
and that during times of significant excitation up to 40% of the total kinetic
energy may be contained into g-modes.",2005-02-07T15:25:56Z
Freeze-out and coagulation in pre-protostellar collapse,"We study the changes in physical and chemical conditions during the collapse
of a pre--protostellar core, starting from initial conditions appropriate to a
dense molecular cloud and proceeding to the ``completely depleted'' limit. We
follow the evolution of the ionization degree and the ionic composition as
functions of time and density. The processes of freeze--out on to the dust
grains and coagulation of the grains were treated simultaneously with the
chemical evolution of the medium.When proceeding at close to its maximum rate,
coagulation has important consequences for the degree of ionization and the
ionic composition of the medium, but its effect on the freeze--out of the
neutral species is modest.An innovation of our study is to calculate the grain
charge distribution which is significant because H+ ions recombine on the
surfaces of negatively charged grains. We also consider the observational
result that N-containing species, such as NH3 and N2H+,remain in the gas phase
at densities for which CO and other C--containing molecules appear to have
frozen on to grain surfaces. We conclude that recent measurements of the
adsorption energies of N2 and CO invalidate the interpretation of these
observations in terms of the relative volatilities of N2 and CO. We consider an
alternative explanation,in terms of low sticking coefficients for either
molecular or atomic N. We find that, irrespective of the nitrogen chemistry,the
main gas phase ion is either H+ or H3+ (and its deuterated isotopes) at
densities above 10^5; whether H+ or H3+ predominates depends sensitively on the
rate of increase in grain size (decrease in grain surface area per unit volume
of gas) during core contraction.Our calculations show that H+ will predominate
if grain coagulation proceeds at close to its maximum rate, and H3+ otherwise.",2005-03-23T15:44:49Z
"Abundances from disentangled component spectra: the eclipsing binary
  V578 Mon","Chemical abundances of the early-B type components of the binary V578 Mon are
derived from disentangled component spectra. This is a pilot study showing
that, even with moderately high line-broadening, metal abundances can be
derived from disentangled spectra with a precision 0.1 dex, relative to
sharp-lined single stars of the same spectral type. This binary is well-suited
for such an assessment because of its youth as a member of the Rosette Nebula
cluster NGC 2244, strengthening the expectation of an unevolved ZAMS chemical
composition. The method is of interest to study rotational driven mixing in
main-sequence stars, with fundamental stellar parameters known with higher
accuracy in (eclipsing) binaries. The paper also includes an evaluation of the
bias that might be present in disentangled spectra.",2005-04-20T12:53:46Z
Confinement-Driven Spatial Variations in the Cosmic Ray Flux,"Low-energy cosmic rays (CRs) are confined by self-generated MHD waves in the
mostly neutral ISM. We show that the CR transport equation can be expressed as
a continuity equation for the CR number density involving an effective
convection velocity. Assuming balance between wave growth and ion-neutral
damping, this equation gives a steady-state condition n_cr ~ n_i^1/2 up to a
critical density for free streaming. This relation naturally accounts for the
heretofore unexplained difference in CR ionization rates derived for dense
diffuse clouds (McCall et al. 2003) and dark clouds, and predicts large spatial
variations in the CR heating rate and pressure.",2005-03-28T07:22:17Z
A Parameter-free Statistical Measurement of Halos with Power Spectra,"We show that, in the halo model of large-scale structure formation, the
difference between the Fourier and the DWT (discrete wavelet transform) power
spectra provides a statistical measurement of the halos. This statistical
quantity is free from parameters related to the shape of the mass profile and
the identification scheme of halos. That is, the statistical measurement is
invariant in the sense that models with reasonably defined and selected
parameters of the halo models should yield the same difference of the Fourier
and DWT spectra. This feature is useful to extract ensemble averaged properties
of halos, which cannot be obtained with the identification of individual halo.
To demonstrate this point, we show with WIGEON hydrodynamical simulation
samples that the spectrum difference provides a quantitative measurement of the
discrepancy of the distribution of baryonic gas from that of the underlying
dark matter field within halos. We also show that the mass density profile of
halos in physical space can be reconstructed with this statistical measurement.
This profile essentially is the average over an ensemble of halos, including
well virialized halos as well as halos with significant internal substructures.
Moreover, this reconstruction is sensitive to the tail of the mass density
profile. We showed that the profile with $1/r^3$ tail gives very different
result from that of $1/r^2$. Other possible applications of this method are
discussed as well.",2005-04-04T16:49:24Z
"SGR giant flares in the BATSE short GRB catalogue: constraints from
  spectroscopy","The giant flare observed on Dec. 27th 2004 from SGR 1806-20 has revived the
idea that a fraction of short (<2 s) Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) is due to giant
flares from Soft Gamma Ray Repeaters located in nearby galaxies. One of the
distinguishing characteristics of these events is the thermal (black body)
spectrum with temperatures ranging from ~50 to ~180 keV, with the highest
temperature observed for the initial 0.2 s spike of the Dec. 27th 2004 event.
We analyzed the spectra of a complete sample of short GRBs with peak fluxes
greater than 4 photon s^(-1) cm^(-2) detected by BATSE. Of the 115 short GRBs
so selected only 76 had sufficient signal to noise to allow the spectral
analysis. We find only 3 short GRBs with a spectrum well fitted by a black
body, with 60<kT<90 keV, albeit with a considerably longer duration (i.e. >1
sec) and a more complex light curve than the Dec. 27th 2004 event. This implies
a stringent limit on the rate of extragalactic SGR giant flares with spectral
properties analogous to the Dec. 27th flare. We conclude that up to 4 per cent
of the short GRBs could be associated to giant flares (2 sigma confidence).
This implies that either the distance to SGR 1806-20 is smaller than 15 kpc or
the rate of Galactic giant flares is lower than the estimated 0.033 per year.",2005-04-13T20:21:45Z
Galactic Globular Cluster Relative Ages. II,"We present accurate relative ages for a sample of 55 Galactic globular
clusters. The ages have been obtained by measuring the difference between the
horizontal branch and the turnoff in two, internally photometrically
homogeneous databases. The mutual consistency of the two data sets has been
assessed by comparing the ages of 16 globular clusters in common between the
two databases. We have also investigated the consistency of our relative age
determination within the recent stellar model framework. All clusters with
[Fe/H]<-1.7 are found to be old, and coeval, with the possible exception of two
objects, which are marginally younger. The age dispersion for the metal poor
clusters is 0.6 Gyr (rms), consistent with a null age dispersion. Intermediate
metallicity clusters (-1.7<[Fe/H]<-0.8) are on average 1.5 Gyr younger than the
metal poor ones, with an age dispersion of 1.0 Gyr (rms), and a total age range
of ~3 Gyr. About 15% of the intermediate metallicity clusters are coeval with
the oldest clusters. All the clusters with [Fe/H]>-0.8 are ~1 Gyr younger than
the most metal poor ones, with a relatively small age dispersion, though the
metal rich sample is still too small to allow firmer conclusions. There is no
correlation of the cluster age with the Galactocentric distance. We briefly
discuss the implication of these observational results for the formation
history of the Galaxy.",2005-03-28T18:36:14Z
"Measuring the halo mass of MgII absorbers from their cross-correlation
  with Luminous Red Galaxies","We study the cross-correlation between 716 MgII quasar absorption systems and
about 100,000 Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) selected from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey Data Release 3 in the redshift range 0.4<z<0.8. The MgII systems were
selected to have 2796 & 2803 rest-frame equivalent widths greater than 1.0 \AA
and identifications confirmed by the FeII 2600 or MgI 2852 lines. Over
co-moving scales 0.2--13/h Mpc, the MgII--LRG cross-correlation has an
amplitude 0.69+/-0.09 times that of the LRG--LRG auto-correlation. Since LRGs
have halo-masses of 10^{13} \msun, this strong cross-correlation implies that
the absorber host-galaxies have halo-masses 1--2 times 10^{12} \msun.",2005-04-19T14:56:22Z
Climatic and Biogeochemical Effects of a Galactic Gamma-Ray Burst,"It is likely that one or more gamma-ray bursts within our galaxy have
strongly irradiated the Earth in the last Gy. This produces significant
atmospheric ionization and dissociation, resulting in ozone depletion and
DNA-damaging ultraviolet solar flux reaching the surface for up to a decade.
Here we show the first detailed computation of two other significant effects.
Visible opacity of NO2 is sufficient to reduce solar energy at the surface up
to a few percent, with the greatest effect at the poles, which may be
sufficient to initiate glaciation. Rainout of dilute nitric acid is could have
been important for a burst nearer than our conservative nearest burst. These
results support the hypothesis that the characteristics of the late Ordovician
mass extinction are consistent with GRB initiation.",2005-03-29T16:18:37Z
"Upper limits on CO 4.7 micron emission from disks around five Herbig
  Ae/Be stars","We present the results of medium-resolution spectroscopy of five nearby
Herbig Ae/Be stars at 4.7 micron: UX Ori, HD 34282, HD 50138, V380 Ori, HK Ori.
The goal was to search for CO fundamental ro-vibrational emission. None of the
targets show CO features, either in absorption nor in emission. We derive a
5sigma upper limit of < 10^-12 cm^-2 to the column density of hot CO (T ~ 1500
K) in the sources. These upper limits are considerably lower than the values of
Herbig Ae/Be stars for which warm and hot CO emission has been reported.The
non-detection of CO v=1-0 emission in these five targets suggest that Herbig
Ae/Be stars are not a homogeneous group with respect to the structure of the
gaseous disk and/or the amount of CO in the inner 50 AU of their disks.",2005-03-15T15:15:43Z
Earth-mass dark halos are torn into dark mini-streams by stars,"The promising neutralino dark matter particles generically condense into
numerous earth-mass dark halos with smaller substructures suppressed by free
streaming\cite{berezinsky}. The recent {\it Letter to Nature}\cite{moore}
claims that these 0.01pc-sized dense halos emerged at redshifts 60--26 are
rarely destructed inside galaxies, hence the nearest halos at about 0.1pc from
Earth are bright in annihilation-powered gamma-rays, but are inaccessible to
direct detections. However, most mini-halos reaching solar neighbourhood should
experience strong impulses by individual stars in the Galactic disk and bulge,
and have been torn into pc-long tidal streams over a Hubble time with only
modest overdensity, reducing indirect annihilation signals. Sweeping across the
solar system per century, mini-streams leave directional and temporal
signatures for direct searches of neutralinos.",2005-02-02T20:24:53Z
"MACHe3, a prototype for non-baryonic dark matter search: KeV event
  detection and multicell correlation","Superfluid He3 at ultra-low temperatures (100 microKelvins) is a sensitive
medium for the bolometric detection of particles. MACHe3 (MAtrix of Cells of
Helium 3) is a project for non-baryonic dark matter search using He3 as a
sensitive medium. Simulations made on a high granularity detector show a very
good rejection to background signals. A multicell prototype including 3
bolometers has been developed to allow correlations between the cells for
background event discrimination. One of the cells contains a low activity Co57
source providing conversion electrons of 7.3 and 13.6 keV to confirm the
detection of low energy events. First results on the multicell prototype are
presented. A detection threshold of 1 keV has been achieved. The detection of
low energy conversion electrons coming from the Co57 source is highlighted as
well as the cosmic muon spectrum measurement. The possibility to reject
background events by using the correlation among the cells is demonstrated from
the simultaneous detection of muons in different cells.",2005-04-28T13:11:14Z
Blank Field Sources in the ROSAT HRI Brera Multiscale Wavelet catalog,"The search for Blank Field Sources (BFS), i.e. X-ray sources without optical
counterparts, paves the way to the identification of unusual objects in the
X-ray sky. Here we present four BFS detected in the Brera Multiscale Wavelet
catalog of ROSAT HRI observations. This sample has been selected on the basis
of source brightness, distance from possible counterparts at other wavelengths,
point-like shape and good estimate of the X-ray flux (f_X). The observed f_X
and the limiting magnitude of the optical catalogs fix a lower limit for our
BFS on f_X/f_opt~40. This value puts them well beyond 90% threshold for usual
source classes once HRI energy band and proper spectral shape are taken into
account, leaving room for speculation on their nature. Three BFS show also
evidence of a transient behaviour.",2005-05-13T16:06:19Z
"Non-Gaussianity of Large-Scale Cosmic Microwave Background Anisotropies
  beyond Perturbation Theory","We compute the fully non-linear Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
anisotropies on scales larger than the horizon at last-scattering in terms of
only the curvature perturbation, providing a generalization of the linear
Sachs-Wolfe effect at any order in perturbation theory. We show how to compute
the n-point connected correlation functions of the large-scale CMB anisotropies
for generic primordial seeds provided by standard slow-roll inflation as well
as the curvaton and other scenarios for the generation of cosmological
perturbations. As an application of our formalism, we compute the three- and
four-point connected correlation functions whose detection in future CMB
experiments might be used to assess the level of primordial non-Gaussianity,
giving the theoretical predictions for the parameters of quadratic and cubic
non-linearities f_NL and g_NL.",2005-06-17T12:57:58Z
"A 10 micron spectroscopic survey of Herbig Ae star disks: grain growth
  and crystallization","We present spectroscopic observations of a large sample of Herbig Ae stars in
the 10 micrometer spectral region. We perform compositional fits of the spectra
based on properties of homogeneous as well as inhomogeneous spherical
particles, and derive the mineralogy and typical grain sizes of the dust
responsible for the 10 $\mu$m emission. Several trends are reported that can
constrain theoretical models of dust processing in these systems: i) none of
the sources consists of fully pristine dust comparable to that found in the
interstellar medium, ii) all sources with a high fraction of crystalline
silicates are dominated by large grains, iii) the disks around more massive
stars (M >~ 2.5 M_sun, L >~ 60 L_sun) have a higher fraction of crystalline
silicates than those around lower mass stars, iv) in the subset of lower mass
stars (M <~ 2.5 M_sun) there is no correlation between stellar parameters and
the derived crystallinity of the dust. The correlation between the shape and
strength of the 10 micron silicate feature reported by van Boekel et al. (2003)
is reconfirmed with this larger sample. The evidence presented in this paper is
combined with that of other studies to present a likely scenario of dust
processing in Herbig Ae systems. We conclude that the present data favour a
scenario in which the crystalline silicates are produced in the innermost
regions of the disk, close to the star, and transported outward to the regions
where they can be detected by means of 10 micron spectroscopy. Additionally, we
conclude that the final crystallinity of these disks is reached very soon after
active accretion has stopped.",2005-03-23T20:44:12Z
Dark energy and the generalized second law,"We explore the thermodynamics of dark energy taking into account the
existence of the observer's event horizon in accelerated universes. Except for
the initial stage of Chaplygin gas dominated expansion, the generalized second
law of gravitational thermodynamics is fulfilled and the temperature of the
phantom fluid results positive. This substantially extends the work of Pollock
and Singh [10] on the thermodynamics of super--inflationary expansion.",2005-05-30T14:03:02Z
"Infrared Emission from Intracluster Dust Grains and Constraints on Dust
  Properties","For 117 clusters of galaxies, we explore the detectability of intracluster
dust grains by current and future infrared facilities, taking into account both
collisional heating and sputtering of grains by ambient plasma. If the dust
grains are injected into the intergalactic space with the amount and size
comparable to the Galactic values, the dust-to-gas ratio is typically $10^{-6}$
and the mean dust temperature is $\sim 30$ K near the cluster center. The
predicted infrared intensities lie marginally above the detection thresholds
for Spitzer Space Telescope, ASTRO-F, Herschel and SPICA missions. For some
nearby clusters such as Perseus, A3571, A2319, A3112 and A2204, good detections
of intracluster dust signal are expected in the 70 $\mu$m band. Given rather
tight constraints on the dust temperature from observed electron density and
temperature, the dust mass can be inferred directly from the infrared
observations. Further constraints on the size distribution will be obtained
once multi-band data are available. They will definitely provide a powerful
probe of the dust injection processes and dust-gas interactions in the
intergalactic space.",2005-06-07T16:43:40Z
"The DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey: The Galaxy Luminosity Function to z ~
  1","The evolution of the B-band galaxy luminosity function is measured using a
sample of more than 11,000 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from the DEEP2
Redshift Survey. The rest-frame M_B versus U-B color-magnitude diagram of DEEP2
galaxies shows that the color-magnitude bi-modality seen in galaxies locally is
still present at redshifts z > 1. Dividing the sample at the trough of this
color bimodality into predominantly red and blue galaxies, we find that the
luminosity function of each galaxy color type evolves differently. Blue counts
tend to shift to brighter magnitudes at constant number density, while the red
counts remain largely constant at a fixed absolute magnitude. Using Schechter
functions with fixed faint-end slopes we find that M*_B for blue galaxies
brightens by ~ 1.3 magnitudes per unit redshift, with no significant evolution
in number density. For red galaxies M*_B brightens somewhat less with redshift,
while the formal value of phi* declines. When the population of blue galaxies
is subdivided into two halves using the rest-frame color as the criterion, the
measured evolution of both blue subpopulations is very similar.",2005-06-02T02:17:47Z
Polarization of high-energy pulsar radiation in the striped wind model,"The Stokes parameters of the pulsed synchrotron radiation produced in the
striped pulsar wind model are computed and compared with optical observations
of the Crab pulsar. We assume the main contribution to the wind emissivity
comes from a thin transition layer where the dominant toroidal magnetic field
reverses its polarity. The radial component of the field is neglected, but a
small meridional component is added. The resulting radiation is linearly
polarized (Stokes V=0). In the off-pulse region, the electric vector lies in
the direction of the projection on the sky of the rotation axis of the pulsar.
This property is unique to the wind model and in good agreement with the data.
Other properties such as a reduced degree of polarization and a characteristic
sweep of the polarization angle within the pulses are also reproduced. These
properties are qualitatively unaffected by variations of the wind Lorentz
factor, the electron injection power law index and the inclination of the line
of sight.",2005-05-20T06:14:48Z
GRACOS: Scalable and Load Balanced P3M Cosmological N-body Code,"We present a parallel implementation of the particle-particle/particle-mesh
(P3M) algorithm for distributed memory clusters. The GRACOS (GRAvitational
COSmology) code uses a hybrid method for both computation and domain
decomposition. Long-range forces are computed using a Fourier transform gravity
solver on a regular mesh; the mesh is distributed across parallel processes
using a static one-dimensional slab domain decomposition. Short-range forces
are computed by direct summation of close pairs; particles are distributed
using a dynamic domain decomposition based on a space-filling Hilbert curve. A
nearly-optimal method was devised to dynamically repartition the particle
distribution so as to maintain load balance even for extremely inhomogeneous
mass distributions. Tests using $800^3$ simulations on a 40-processor beowulf
cluster showed good load balance and scalability up to 80 processes. We discuss
the limits on scalability imposed by communication and extreme clustering and
suggest how they may be removed by extending our algorithm to include adaptive
mesh refinement.",2005-05-05T16:37:21Z
Neutrino emission rates in highly magnetized neutron stars revisited,"Magnetars are a subclass of neutron stars whose intense soft-gamma-ray bursts
and quiescent X-ray emission are believed to be powered by the decay of a
strong internal magnetic field. We reanalyze neutrino emission in such stars in
the plausibly relevant regime in which the Landau band spacing of both protons
and electrons is much larger than kT (where k is the Boltzmann constant and T
is the temperature), but still much smaller than the Fermi energies. Focusing
on the direct Urca process, we find that the emissivity oscillates as a
function of density or magnetic field, peaking when the Fermi level of the
protons or electrons lies about 3kT above the bottom of any of their Landau
bands. The oscillation amplitude is comparable to the average emissivity when
the Landau band spacing mentioned above is roughly the geometric mean of kT and
the Fermi energy (excluding mass), i. e., at fields much weaker than required
to confine all particles to the lowest Landau band. Since the density and
magnetic field strength vary continuously inside the neutron star, there will
be alternating surfaces of high and low emissivity. Globally, these
oscillations tend to average out, making it unclear whether there will be any
observable effects.",2005-05-11T23:25:40Z
The Phantom of the OPRA,"The Observed Perlmutter-Riess Acceleration (OPRA) implies that the expansion
of the Universe is currently increasing and is motivation for the so-called
phantom energy models. We consider the dynamics of phantom scalar field models.
An important physical time constraint, which can be used to rule out many
cosmological models, is obtained from the condition that all forms of energy
density, including the field causing OPRA (e.g., the phantom field), must be
non-negligible for an extended period, which is conservatively estimated to be
of the order of a few $Gyr$. We find that this physical time constraint cannot
be satisfied in conventional phantom cosmological models.",2005-03-07T22:50:25Z
"Numeric simulation of relativistic stellar core collapse and the
  formation of Reissner-Nordstrom space-times","The time evolution of a set of 22 Mo unstable charged stars that collapse is
computed integrating the Einstein-Maxwell equations. The model simulate the
collapse of an spherical star that had exhausted its nuclear fuel and have or
acquires a net electric charge in its core while collapsing. When the charge to
mass ratio is Q/M >= 1 the star do not collapse and spreads. On the other hand,
it is observed a different physical behavior with a charge to mass ratio 1 > Q/
M > 0.1. In this case, the collapsing matter forms a bubble enclosing a lower
density core. We discuss an immediate astrophysical consequence of these
results that is a more efficient neutrino trapping during the stellar collapse
and an alternative mechanism for powerful supernova explosions. The outer
space-time of the star is the Reissner-Nordstrom solution that match smoothly
with our interior numerical solution, thus the collapsing models forms
Reissner-Nordstrom black holes.",2005-03-29T20:56:03Z
"A Deep Chandra Survey of the Globular Cluster 47 Tucanae: Catalog of
  Point Sources","We have detected 300 X-ray sources within the half-mass radius (2.79') of the
globular cluster 47 Tucanae in a deep (281 ks) Chandra exposure. We perform
photometry and simple spectral fitting for our detected sources, and construct
luminosity functions, X-ray color-magnitude and color-color diagrams.
Eighty-seven X-ray sources show variability on timescales from hours to years.
Thirty-one of the new X-ray sources are identified with chromospherically
active binaries from the catalogs of Albrow et al. The radial distributions of
detected sources imply roughly 70 are background sources of some kind. Most
source spectra are well-fit by thermal plasma models, except for quiescent
low-mass X-ray binaries (qLMXBs, containing accreting neutron stars) and
millisecond pulsars (MSPs). We identify three new candidate qLMXBs with
relatively low X-ray luminosities. One of the brightest cataclysmic variables
(CVs, X10) shows evidence (a 4.7 hour period pulsation and strong soft X-ray
emission) for a magnetically dominated accretion flow as in AM Her systems.
Most of the bright CVs require intrinsic N_H columns of order 10^{21} cm^-2,
suggesting a possible DQ Her nature. A group of X-ray sources associated with
bright (sub)giant stars also requires intrinsic absorption. By comparing the
X-ray colors, luminosities, variability, and quality of spectral fits of the
detected MSPs to those of unidentified sources, we estimate that a total of
\~25-30 MSPs exist in 47 Tuc (<60 at 95% confidence), regardless of their radio
beaming fraction. We estimate that the total number of neutron stars in 47 Tuc
is of order 300, reducing the discrepancy between theoretical neutron star
retention rates and observed neutron star populations in globular clusters.

The colours of Virgo dEs as seen by SDSS,"A colour analysis of a carefully selected sample of over 200 Virgo cluster
dEs and 8 giant ellipticals (Es) in the SDSS yields the following results: a)
the nucleated dEs (dENs) follow a tight colour-magnitude relation (CMR) which
does not broaden significantly at fainter (Mr > -15) magnitudes, b) the CMR of
dENs smoothly transitions to the CMR of Es, but the latter changes its slope at
about Mr = -20, c) the brighter dENs are consistent with ages of t > 5Gyr and a
decrease of metallicity towards fainter magnitudes, but a possible additional
luminosity-age relation is not ruled out, d) it is crucial to treat dS0s
separately from dEs since their different colour properties would otherwise
bias the comparison of nucleated and non-nucleated dEs (dEnoNs), e) the dEnoNs
show a weak trend towards bluer colours than dENs.",2005-05-03T05:13:16Z
"Differential rotation and meridional flow in the solar convection zone
  and beneath","The influence of the basic rotation on anisotropic and inhomogeneous
turbulence is discussed in the context of differential rotation theory. An
improved representation for the original turbulence leads to a $\Lam$-effect
which complies with the results of 3D numerical simulations. The resulting
rotation law and meridional flow agree well with both the surface observations
($\partial\Om/\partial r<0$ and meridional flow towards the poles) and with the
findings of helioseismology. The computed equatorward flow at the bottom of
convection zone has an amplitude of about 10 m/s and may be significant for the
solar dynamo. The depth of the meridional flow penetration into the radiative
zone is proportional to $\nu^{0.5}_\mathrm{core}$, where $\nu_\mathrm{core}$ is
the viscosity beneath the convection zone. The penetration is very small if the
tachocline is laminar.",2005-06-10T14:46:32Z
Gravitational Microlensing and the Structure of Quasar Outflows,"We show that invaluable information on the structure of quasar outflows can
be obtained by considering microlensing (ML) induced variability of absorption
line troughs in lensed quasars. Depending on the structure and geometry of the
outflowing gas, such extrinsic line variability can be manifested as changes to
the equivalent width of the line as well as line profile distortions. Here we
consider several physically distinct outflow models, having very similar
spectral predictions, and show how ML induced absorption line variability can
be used to distinguish between them. The merits of future systematic studies of
these effects are exemplified.",2005-04-12T05:24:08Z
The mass of the graviton and the cosmological constant puzzle,"We propose an interpretation of the cosmological constant puzzle - i.e., the
enormous value of the ratio $\rho_{Pl}/\rho_{vac} \approx 10^{120} $- in terms
of the total number of gravitons in the observable universe based on a recently
discovered relationship between $\Lambda$ and the mass $m_{g}$ of the graviton.",2005-04-22T17:35:44Z
"The intermediate-age open clusters Ruprecht 4, Ruprecht 7 and Pismis 15","We report on $BVI$ CCD photometry to $V=22.0$ for 3 fields centered on the
region of the Galactic star clusters Ruprecht~4, Ruprecht~7 and Pismis~15 and
on 3 displaced control fields. Ruprecht~4 and Pismis~15 have never been studied
before, and we provide for the first time estimates of their fundamental
parameters, namely, radial extent, age, distance and reddening. Ruprecht~7
(Berkeley~33) however was studied by Mazur et al. (1993). We find that the
three clusters are all of intermediate age (0.8-1.3 Gyr), and with a
metallicity close to or lower than solar.",2005-03-24T18:06:26Z
Self-interaction spin effects in inspiralling compact binaries,"Gravitational radiation drives compact binaries through an inspiral phase
towards a final coalescence. For binaries with\textit{spin, mass quadrupole and
magnetic dipole moments}, various contributions add to this process, which is
characterized by the rate of increase $df/dt$ of the gravitational wave
frequency and the accumulated number $\mathcal{N}$ of gravitational wave
cycles. We present here all contributions to $df/dt$ and $% \mathcal{N}$ up to
the second post-Newtonian order. Among them we give for the first time the
contributions due to the \textit{self-interaction of individual spins}. These
are shown to be commensurable with the proper spin-spin contributions for the
recently discovered J0737-3039 double pulsar, and argued to represent the first
corrections to the radiation reaction in the Lense-Thirring approach.",2005-04-25T13:28:25Z
An Overview of the Performance of the Chandra X-Ray Observatory,"The Chandra X-ray Observatory is the X-ray component of NASA's Great
Observatory Program which includes the recently launched Spitzer Infrared
Telescope, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) for observations in the visible,
and the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO) which, after providing years of
useful data has reentered the atmosphere. All these facilities provide, or
provided, scientific data to the international astronomical community in
response to peer-reviewed proposals for their use. The Chandra X-ray
Observatory was the result of the efforts of many academic, commercial, and
government organizations primarily in the United States but also in Europe.
NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) manages the Project and provides
Project Science; Northrop Grumman Space Technology (NGST -- formerly TRW)
served as prime contractor responsible for providing the spacecraft, the
telescope, and assembling and testing the Observatory; and the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) provides technical support and is responsible
for ground operations including the Chandra X-ray Center (CXC). Telescope and
instrument teams at SAO, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the
Pennsylvania State University (PSU), the Space Research Institute of the
Netherlands (SRON), the Max-Planck Institut fur extraterrestrische Physik
(MPE), and the University of Kiel also provide technical support to the Chandra
Project. We present here a detailed description of the hardware, its on-orbit
performance, and a brief overview of some of the remarkable discoveries that
illustrate that performance.",2005-03-15T15:53:11Z
Population III and the Near-Infrared Background Excess,"We make a critical assessment of models that attribute the recently detected
near-infrared background ``excess'' (NIRBE) to the redshifted light from
Population III objects. To supply the required 25 keV/baryon at redshift 9, Pop
III massive stars must form with an efficiency exceeding 30% in all
``minihalos'' with virial temperatures above a few hundred kelvins: to avoid
excessive metal pollution, most of the baryons once in Pop III stars must end
up in intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). Gas accretion onto such IMBHs must
either be inhibited or lead to early miniquasars with steep UV/X-ray spectra,
in order not to overproduce the present-day unresolved soft X-ray background.
In the latter case (NIRBE dominated by ""X-ray quiet miniquasars""), the total
mass density of IMBHs at redshift 9 must be >50 times higher than the mass
density of supermassive black holes observed today in the nuclei of galaxies. A
stellar-dominated NIRBE is less economical energetically: more than 5% of all
baryons in the universe must be processed into Population III stars. We survey
various aspects of the Population III hypothesis for the NIRBE, and show that
the ionizing photon budget required to account for the NIRBE is much larger
than that required to explain the high electron scattering optical depth
measured by the WMAP satellite.",2005-02-15T22:32:50Z
Simulations of Dust in Interacting Galaxies I: Dust Attenuation,"A new Monte-Carlo radiative-transfer code, Sunrise, is used in conjunction
with hydrodynamic simulations of major galaxy mergers to calculate the effects
of dust in such systems. The simulations are in good agreement with
observations of dust absorption in starburst galaxies, and the dust has a
profound effect on their appearance. The dust attenuation increases with
luminosity such that at peak luminosities ~90% of the bolometric luminosity is
absorbed by dust. In general, the detailed appearance of the merging event
depends on the stage of the merger and the geometry of the encounter. The
fraction of bolometric energy absorbed by the dust, however, is a robust
quantity that can be predicted from the intrinsic properties bolometric
luminosity, baryonic mass, star-formation rate, and metallicity of the system.
This paper presents fitting formulae, valid over a wide range of masses and
metallicities, from which the absorbed fraction of luminosity (and consequently
also the infrared dust luminosity) can be predicted. The attenuation of the
luminosity at specific wavelengths can also be predicted, albeit with a larger
scatter due to the variation with viewing angle. These formulae for dust
attenuation appear to be valid for both isolated and interacting galaxies, are
consistent with earlier studies, and would be suitable for inclusion in
theoretical models, e.g. semi-analytic models of galaxy formation.",2005-03-07T03:50:11Z
"On particle acceleration around shocks II: a fully general method for
  arbitrary shock velocities and scattering media","The probability that a particle, crossing the shock along a given direction,
be reflected backwards along another direction, was shown to be the key element
in determining the spectrum of non--thermal particles accelerated via the Fermi
mechanism around a plane--parallel shock in the test--particle limit. Here an
explicit equation for this probability distribution is given, for both the
upstream and downstream sections. Though analytically intractable, this
equation is solved numerically, allowing the determination of the spectrum in
full generality, without limitation to shock speed or scattering properties. A
number of cases is then computed, making contact with previous numerical work,
in all regimes: Newtonian, trans--relativistic, and fully relativistic.",2005-03-09T15:37:43Z
Inflationary Solutions in Nonminimally Coupled Scalar Field Theory,"We study analytically and numerically the inflationary solutions for various
type scalar potentials in the nonminimally coupled scalar field theory. The
Hamilton-Jacobi equation is used to deal with nonlinear evolutions of
inhomogeneous spacetimes and the long-wavelength approximation is employed. The
constraints that lead to a sufficient inflation are found for the nonminimal
coupling constant and initial conditions of the scalar field for inflation
potentials. In particular, we numerically find an inflationary solution in the
new inflation model of a nonminimal scalar field.",2005-05-10T12:10:48Z
The SCORPIO focal reducer,"We describe the SCORPIO focal reducer that has been used since the fall of
2000 for observations on the 6-m Special Astrophysical Observatory telescope.
We give parameters of the instrument in various observing modes (direct images,
long-slit and multislit spectroscopy, spectropolarimetry, Fabry-Perot panoramic
spectroscopy). Observations of various astronomical objects are used as
examples to demonstrate the SCORPIO capabilities.",2005-02-04T11:42:56Z
Primordial non-gaussianities from multiple-field inflation,"We calculate the three-point correlation function evaluated at horizon
crossing for a set of interacting scalar fields coupled to gravity during
inflation. This provides the initial condition for the three-point function of
the curvature perturbation in the Sasaki--Stewart \delta N formulation. We find
that the effect is small, of the order of a slow-roll parameter, and that the
non-gaussianity can be determined on large scales once the unperturbed
background evolution is known. As an example of the use of our formalism, we
calculate the primordial non-gaussianity arising in a model of assisted
inflation.",2005-06-02T12:10:52Z
The C star outer disk population of M31 seen with the SLOAN filters,"We employ the CFHT Megacam camera to survey ~ one deg$^2$ of the southern
outer disc of M31, a region which includes the area where Battinelli et al.
(2003) have identified nearly one thousand C stars. In the outer M31 region not
previously surveyed, we identify 361 new C star candidates, having similar
photometric properties to the known ones, and confirm theslight decrease in the
luminosity of C stars with galactocentric distances. We show that the Sloan g',
r', i' filters are a viable approach, comparable to (CN - TiO), to identify C
stars. We find that the (g' - r') colours of cool C stars can be so red that
prohibitively long g' exposures are needed to acquire faint extragalactic C
stars. This makes the Sloan filters a less promising approach to extend a C
star survey to several Mpc. Our uniform large field survey detects the edge of
M31 disk at ~ 35 kpc. The intermediate-age population, represented by C stars,
extends further to ~ 40 kpc.",2005-04-14T12:59:44Z
"NIR observations of dEs in the Virgo cluster: a structural continuity
  with giant Ellipticals","The structural properties of a sample of 50 dEs in the Virgo cluster are here
derived from Near InfraRed (NIR, H-band 1.65 micron) surface photometry and
analysed. One-dimensional surface brightness (SB) profiles are extracted using
elliptical isophote fitting. They are characterised by means of structural
parameters, namely the half light radius R_e, the average surface brightness
within R_e (mu_e), and a concentration index (c_31). We show that typical dEs
have close-to-exponential NIR SB distributions. The relations between dEs and
giant ellipticals (Es) are investigated by comparing the NIR structural
parameters of 273 Es in nearby clusters. Further analysis is conducted using
the optical-NIR colour B-H and by studying the relationships between structural
and dynamical parameters (fundamental plane) for the two classes of galaxies.
The transition between the two regimes is smooth and no dichotomy is seen.",2005-04-21T07:58:42Z
"Iron abundances derived from RR Lyrae light curves and low-dispersion
  spectroscopy","With the aid of the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) database on the Galactic
field, we compare the iron abundances of fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars
derived from the Fourier parameters with those obtained from low-dispersion
spectroscopy. We show from a set of 79 stars, distinct from the original
calibrating sample of the Fourier method and selected without quality control,
that almost all discrepant estimates are the results of some defects or
peculiarities either in the photometry or in the spectroscopy. Omitting objects
deviating by more than 0.4dex, the remaining subsample of 64 stars yields
Fourier abundances that fit the spectroscopic ones with a standard deviation of
0.20dex. Other, more stringent selection criteria and different Fourier
decompositions lead to smaller subsamples and concomitant better agreement,
down to 0.16dex standard deviation. Except perhaps for two variables among the
163 stars, comprised of the ASAS variables and those of the original
calibrating set of the Fourier method, all discrepant values can be accounted
for by observational noise and insufficient data coverage. We suggest that the
agreement can be further improved when new, more accurate spectroscopic data
become available for a test with the best photometric data. As a by-product of
this analysis, we also compute revised periods and select Blazhko variables.",2005-04-14T14:02:48Z
On the Properties of the HI shells in the Small Magellanic CLoud,"There are 509 expanding neutral hydrogen shells catalogued in the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC), all apparently very young, with dynamical ages of a few
Myr. To examine their relationship with young stellar objects we
cross-correlated the shell catalogue with various catalogues of OB
associations, super giants, Cepheids, WR stars, supernova remnants, and star
clusters. The incidence of chance line-ups was estimated via Monte-Carlo
simulations, and found to be high. However, it is important that there are 1.5
times more shells that are {\em not} spatially correlated to an OB association,
than shells that are. Moreover, 59 of the 509 shells lie mainly in low stellar
density fields and have no young stellar objects associated with them, and
therefore no obvious energy source. It is shown that, on the whole, the
properties of these ""empty"" shells are very similar to the properties of the
rest of the shells, once selection biases are taken into account. Theoretical
implications of the results are discussed.",2005-04-20T13:30:07Z
"Deciphering the cosmic star formation history and the Nature of Type Ia
  Supernovae by Future Supernova Surveys","We investigate the prospects of future supernova searches to get meaningful
constraints about the cosmic star formation history (CSFH) and the delay time
of type Ia supernovae from star formation (tau_{Ia}), based only on supernova
data. Here we parameterize the CSFH by two parameters, alpha and beta that are
the evolutionary indices (proportional to (1+z)^{alpha, beta}) at z <~ 1 and >~
1, respectively, and quantitatively examined how well the three parameters
(alpha, beta, and tau_{Ia}) can be constrained in ongoing and future supernova
surveys. We found that the type classification of detected supernovae down to
the magnitude of I_{AB} ~ 27 is essential, to get useful constraint on beta.
The parameter tau_{Ia} can also be constrained within an accuracy of ~ 1--2
Gyr, without knowing alpha that is somewhat degenerate with tau_{Ia}. This
might be potentially achieved by ground-based surveys but depending on the
still highly uncertain type-classification by imaging data. More reliable
classification will be achieved by the SNAP mission. The supernova counts at a
magnitude level of I_{AB} or K_{AB} ~ 30 will allow us to break degeneracies
between alpha and tau_{Ia} and independently constrain all the three
parameters, even without knowing supernova types. This can be achieved by the
SNAP and JWST missions, having different strength of larger statistics and
reach to higher redshifts, respectively. The dependence of observable
quantities on survey time intervals is also quantitatively calculated and
discussed.",2005-05-15T18:22:07Z
Models of class II methanol masers based on improved molecular data,"The class II masers of methanol are associated with the early stages of
formation of high-mass stars. Modelling of these dense, dusty environments has
demonstrated that pumping by infrared radiation can account for the observed
masers. Collisions with other molecules in the ambient gas also play a
significant role, but have not been well modelled in the past. Here we examine
the effects on the maser models of newly available collision rate coefficients
for methanol. The new collision data does not alter which transitions become
masers in the models, but does influence their brightness and the conditions
under which they switch on and off. At gas temperatures above 100 K the effects
are broadly consistent with a reduction in the overall collision cross-section.
This means, for example, that a slightly higher gas density than identified
previously can account for most of the observed masers in W3(OH). We have also
examined the effects of including more excited state energy levels in the
models, and find that these play a significant role only at dust temperatures
above 300 K. An updated list of class II methanol maser candidates is
presented.",2005-04-08T01:08:18Z
"BhaBAR: Big Halpha kinematical sample of BARred spiral galaxies - I.
  Fabry-Perot Observations of 21 galaxies","The Halpha gas kinematics of twenty-one representative barred spiral galaxies
belonging to the BHaBAR sample is presented. The galaxies were observed with
FaNTOmM, a Fabry-Perot integral-field spectrometer, on three different
telescopes. The 3D data cubes were processed through a robust pipeline with the
aim of providing the most homogeneous and accurate dataset possible useful for
further analysis. The data cubes were spatially binned to a constant
signal-to-noise ratio, typically around 7. Maps of the monochromatic Halpha
emission line and of the velocity field were generated and the kinematical
parameters were derived for the whole sample using tilted-ring models. The
photometrical and kinematical parameters (position angle of the major axis,
inclination, systemic velocity and kinematical centre) are in relative good
agreement, except maybe for the later-type spirals.",2005-04-18T16:09:27Z
The fundamental plane of isolated early-type galaxies,"Here we present new measurements of effective radii, surface brightnesses and
internal velocity dispersions for 23 isolated early-type galaxies. The
photometric properties are derived from new multi-colour imaging of 10
galaxies, whereas the central kinematics for 7 galaxies are taken from
forthcoming work by Hau & Forbes. These are supplemented with data from the
literature. We reproduce the colour-magnitude and Kormendy relations and
strengthen the result of Paper I that isolated galaxies follow the same
photometric relations as galaxies in high density environments. We also find
that some isolated galaxies reveal fine structure indicative of a recent merger
while others appear undisturbed. We examine the Fundamental Plane in both
traditional R_e, mu_e and sigma space and also kappa-space. Most isolated
galaxies follow the same Fundamental Plane tilt and scatter for galaxies in
high density environments. However, a few galaxies notably deviate from the
plane in the sense of having smaller M/L ratios. This can be understood in
terms of their younger stellar populations, which are presumably induced by a
gaseous merger. Overall, isolated galaxies have similar properties to those in
roups and clusters with a slight enhancement in the frequency of recent
mergers/interactions.",2005-05-12T18:32:02Z
The Luminosity Function and Formation Rate History of GRBs,"The isotropic luminosity function (LF) and formation rate history (FRH) of
long GRBs is by the first time constrained by using jointly both the observed
GRB peak-flux and redshift distributions. Our results support an evolving LF
and a FRH that keeps increasing after z=2. We discuss some interesting
implications related to these results.",2005-04-19T15:28:58Z
"An Asymmetric, Energetic Type Ic Supernova Viewed Off-Axis, and a Link
  to Gamma-Ray Bursts","Type Ic supernovae, the explosions following the core collapse of massive
stars that have previously lost their hydrogen and helium envelopes, are
particularly interesting because of the link with long-duration gamma-ray
bursts. Although indications exist that these explosions are aspherical, direct
evidence has still been missing. Late-time observations of SN 2003jd, a
luminous Type Ic supernova, provide such evidence. Recent Subaru and Keck
spectra reveal double-peaked profiles in the nebular lines of neutral oxygen
and magnesium. These profiles are different from those of known Type Ic
supernovae, with or without a gamma-ray burst, and they can be understood if SN
2003jd was an aspherical, axisymmetric explosion viewed from near the
equatorial plane. If SN 2003jd was associated with a gamma-ray burst, we missed
the burst as it was pointing away from us.",2005-05-10T17:54:08Z
Low Mass Star Formation in the Gum Nebula: The CG~30/31/38 complex,"We present photometric and spectroscopic results for the low mass pre-main
sequence (PMS) stars with spectral types K - M in the cometary globule (CG)
30/31/38 complex. We obtained multi-object high resolution spectra for the
targets selected as possible PMS stars from multi-wavelength photometry. We
identified 11 PMS stars brighter than V = 16.5 with ages < 5 Myr at a distance
of approximately 200 pc. The spatial distribution of the PMS stars, CG clouds,
and ionizing sources (O stars and supernova remnants) suggests a possible
triggered origin of the star formation in this region. We confirm the youth of
the photometrically selected PMS stars using the lithium abundances. The radial
velocities of the low mass PMS stars are consistent with those of the cometary
globules. Most of the PMS stars show weak Halpha emission with W(Halpha) < 10
A. Only 1 out of the 11 PMS stars shows a moderate near-IR excess, which
suggests a short survival time (t < 5 Myr) of circumstellar disks in this star
forming environment. In addition, we find five young late type stars and one Ae
star which have no obvious relation to the CG 30/31/38 complex. We also discuss
a possible scenario of star formation history in the CG 30/31/38 region.",2005-02-15T07:13:38Z
Two extreme double-peaked line emitters in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,"Double-peaked Balmer lines have been observed in about 150 AGNs and were
interpreted preferably as emission from relativistic accretion disks. In this
paper, we report the discovery of extreme double-peaked lines in SDSS
J0942+0900 and SDSS J1417+6141. The FWHM of the Halpha line ~40,600 km/s in the
first object is almost twice as large as the broadest one previously known. By
comparing the line profile with accretion disk models, we find that most of the
line flux is emitted from a narrow annulus around 100Rg in SDSS J0942+0900, and
from a disk of radii between 100 and 400Rg in SDSS J1417+6141. This is the
first time that an accretion disk at radii below 100Rg can be directly probed
through optical emission lines. A certain asymmetry in the disk is required for
both objects. Another much weaker broad Halpha component (EW~20A, and FWHM
4000km/s) is also detected in both objects. Both objects show weak radio
emission and strong high-ionization narrow lines.",2005-04-14T11:01:34Z
"Dense Cloud Ablation and Ram Pressure Stripping of the Virgo Spiral NGC
  4402","We present optical, HI and radio continuum observations of the highly
inclined Virgo Cluster Sc galaxy NGC 4402, which show evidence for ram-pressure
stripping and dense cloud ablation. VLA HI and radio continuum maps show a
truncated gas disk and emission to the northwest of the main disk emission. In
particular, the radio continuum emission is asymmetrically extended to the
north and skewed to the west. The Halpha image shows numerous HII complexes
along the southern edge of the gas disk, possibly indicating star formation
triggered by the ICM pressure. BVR images at 0.5"" resolution obtained with the
WIYN Tip-Tilt Imager show a remarkable dust lane morphology: at half the
optical radius, the dust lane of the galaxy curves up and out of the disk,
matching the HI morphology. Large dust plumes extend upward for ~1.5 kpc from
luminous young star clusters at the SE edge of the truncated gas disk. These
star clusters are very blue, indicating very little dust reddening, which
suggests dust blown away by an ICM wind at the leading edge of the interaction.
To the south of the main ridge of interstellar material, where the galaxy is
relatively clean of gas and dust, we have discovered 1 kpc long linear dust
filaments with a position angle that matches the extraplanar radio continuum
tail; we interpret this angle as the projected ICM wind direction. One of the
observed dust filaments has an HII region at its head. We interpret these dust
filaments as large, dense clouds which were initially left behind as the
low-density ISM is stripped, but are then ablated by the ICM wind. These
results provide striking new evidence on the fate of molecular clouds in
stripped cluster galaxies.",2005-03-18T21:11:54Z
Hot-Jupiters and hot-Neptunes: a common origin?,"We compare evolutionary models for close-in exoplanets coupling irradiation
and evaporation due respectively to the thermal and high energy flux of the
parent star with observations of recently discovered new transiting planets.
The models provide an overall good agreement with observations, although at the
very limit of the quoted error bars of OGLE-TR-10, depending on its age. Using
the same general theory, we show that the three recently detected hot-Neptune
planets (GJ436, $\rho$ Cancri, $\mu$ Ara) may originate from more massive gas
giants which have undergone significant evaporation. We thus suggest that
hot-Neptunes and hot-Jupiters may share the same origin and evolution history.
Our scenario provides testable predictions in terms of the mass-radius
relationships of these hot-Neptunes.",2005-05-03T12:41:07Z
An HST Study of the Supernovae Accompanying GRB 040924 and GRB 041006,"We present the results from a {\it Hubble Space Telescope/ACS} study of the
supernovae associated with gamma-ray bursts 040924 ($z=0.86$) and 041006
($z=0.71$). We find evidence that both GRBs were associated with a SN
1998bw-like supernova dimmed by $\sim 1.5$ and $\sim 0.3$ magnitudes,
respectively, making GRB 040924 the faintest GRB-associated SN ever detected.
We study the luminosity dispersion in GRB/XRF-associated SNe and compare to
local Type Ibc supernovae from the literature. We find significant overlap
between the two samples, suggesting that GRB/XRF-associated SNe are not
necessarily more luminous nor produce more $^{56}$Ni than local SNe. Based on
the current (limited) datasets, we find that the two samples may share a
similar $^{56}$Ni production mechanism.",2005-04-15T20:01:07Z
RRAB Variables and Metallicity,"A preliminary analysis of the UBV light curves of RR AB variables revealed
that they contain information on the metallicities of these stars. The computed
parameters which correlate with metallicity are given in the tables for 99 RR
AB stars including 12 variables without previously determined metallicities.",2005-05-11T07:52:34Z
CMB Anisotropy of Spherical Spaces,"The first-year WMAP data taken at their face value hint that the Universe
might be slightly positively curved and therefore necessarily finite, since all
spherical (Clifford-Klein) space forms M^3 = S^3/Gamma, given by the quotient
of S^3 by a group Gamma of covering transformations, possess this property. We
examine the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) for all typical
groups Gamma corresponding to homogeneous universes. The CMB angular power
spectrum and the temperature correlation function are computed for the
homogeneous spaces as a function of the total energy density parameter
Omega_tot in the large range [1.01, 1.20] and are compared with the WMAP data.
We find that out of the infinitely many homogeneous spaces only the three
corresponding to the binary dihedral group T*, the binary octahedral group O*,
and the binary icosahedral group I* are in agreement with the WMAP
observations. Furthermore, if Omega_tot is restricted to the interval [1.00,
1.04], the space described by T* is excluded since it requires a value of
Omega_tot which is probably too large being in the range [1.06, 1.07]. We thus
conclude that there remain only the two homogeneous spherical spaces S^3/O* and
S^3/I* with Omega_tot of about 1.038 and 1.018, respectively, as possible
topologies for our Universe.",2005-04-29T10:35:36Z
"Measuring the cosmic evolution of dark energy with baryonic oscillations
  in the galaxy power spectrum","We use Monte Carlo techniques to simulate the ability of future large
high-redshift galaxy surveys to measure the temporal evolution of the dark
energy equation-of-state w(z), using the baryonic acoustic oscillations in the
clustering power spectrum as a 'standard ruler'. Our analysis only utilizes the
oscillatory component of the power spectrum and not its overall shape, which is
potentially susceptible to broadband tilts induced by a host of model-dependent
systematic effects. Our results are therefore robust and conservative. We show
that baryon oscillation constraints can be thought of, to high accuracy, as a
direct probe of the distance - redshift and expansion rate - redshift relations
where distances are measured in units of the sound horizon. Distance precisions
of 1% are obtainable for a fiducial redshift survey covering 10,000 deg^2 and
redshift range 0.5 < z < 3.5. If the dark energy is further characterized by
w(z) = w_0 + w_1 z (with a cut-off in the evolving term at z = 2), we can then
measure the parameters w_0 and w_1 with a precision exceeding current knowledge
by a factor of ten: 1 sigma accuracies Delta w_0 ~ 0.03 and Delta w_1 ~ 0.06
are obtainable (assuming a flat universe and that the other cosmological
parameters Omega_m} and h could be measured independently to a precision of +/-
0.01 by combinations of future CMB and other experiments). We quantify how this
performance degrades with redshift/areal coverage and knowledge of Omega_m and
h, and discuss realistic observational prospects for such large-scale
spectroscopic redshift surveys, with a variety of diverse techniques. We also

produce measurements of (w_0,w_1) with the baryonic oscillation method which
may be competitive in the short term.",2005-05-30T20:00:01Z
NGC 770: A Counter-Rotating Core in a Low-Luminosity Elliptical Galaxy,"We present evidence for a counter-rotating core in the low-luminosity (M_B =
-18.2) elliptical galaxy NGC 770 based on internal stellar kinematic data. This
counter-rotating core is unusual as NGC 770 is not the primary galaxy in the
region and it lies in an environment with evidence of on-going tidal
interactions. We discovered the counter-rotating core via single-slit Keck/ESI
echelle spectroscopy; subsequent integral field spectroscopy was obtained with
the Gemini/GMOS IFU. The counter-rotating region has a peak rotation velocity
of 21 km/s as compared to the main galaxy's rotation speed of greater than 45
km/s in the opposite direction. The counter-rotating region extends to a radius
of 4'' (0.6 kpc), slightly smaller than the half-light radius of the galaxy
which is 5.3'' (0.8 kpc) and is confined to a disk whose scale height is less
than 0.8'' (0.1 kpc). We compute an age and metallicity of the inner
counter-rotating region of 3 +/- 0.5 Gyr and [Fe/H] = 0.2 +/- 0.2 dex, based on
Lick absorption-line indices. The lack of other large galaxies in this region
limits possible scenarios for the formation of the counter-rotating core. We
discuss several scenarios and favor one in which NGC 770 accreted a small
gas-rich dwarf galaxy during a very minor merging event. If this scenario is
correct, it represents one of the few known examples of merging between two
dwarf-sized galaxies.",2005-03-16T21:17:56Z
"Object classification and the determination of stellar parameters with
  Gaia","Gaia will observe more than one billion objects brighter than V=20, including
stars, asteroids, galaxies and quasars. As Gaia performs real time detection
(i.e. without an input catalogue) the intrinsic properties of most of these
objects will not be known a priori. An integral part of the Gaia data
processing is therefore to classify everything observed. This will be based
primarily on multiband photometry provided by Gaia, but should also make
optimal use of the high resolution spectroscopy (for brighter stars) and the
parallaxes. In addition to a broad classification, we can also determine
fundamental stellar parameters, in particular effective temperature,
metallicity and the line-of-sight interstellar extinction. Such information
will be essential for fully exploiting the astrometric part of the Gaia
catalogue for stellar population studies. However, extracting this information
is a significant challenge, and will need to make use of appropriate
multidimensional data analysis techniques. I outline some of the problems and
the strategies being developed to tackle them.",2005-02-04T12:59:35Z
Nanodiamond dust and the far-ultraviolet quasar break,"We explore the possibility that the steepening observed shortward of 1000A in
the energy distribution of quasars may result from absorption by dust, being
either intrinsic to the quasar environment or intergalactic. We find that a
dust extinction curve consisting of nanodiamonds, composed of terrestrial cubic
diamonds or with surface impurities as found in carbonaceous chondrite
meteorites, such as Allende, is successful in reproducing the sharp break
observed. The intergalactic dust model is partially successful in explaining
the shape of the composite energy distribution, but must be discarded in the
end, as the amount of crystalline dust required is unreasonable and would imply
an improbable fine tuning among the dust formation processes. The alternative
intrinsic dust model requires a mixture of both cubic diamonds and Allende
nanodiamonds and provide a better fit of the UV break. The gas column densities
implied are of the order 10^{20} cm^{-2} assuming solar metallicity for carbon
and full depletion of carbon into dust. The absorption only occurs in the
ultraviolet and is totally negligible in the visible. The minimum dust mass
required is of the order ~ 0.003 r_{pc}^{2}M_o, where r_{pc} is the distance in
parsec between the dust screen and the continuum source. The intrinsic dust
model reproduces the flux {\it rise} observed around 660A in key quasar spectra
quite well. We present indirect evidence of a shallow continuum break near 670A
(18.5 eV), which would be intrinsic to the quasar continuum.",2005-05-29T23:48:15Z
"The Deepest Supernova Search is Realized in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field
  Survey","The Hubble Ultra Deep Field Survey has not only provided the deepest optical
and near infrared views of universe, but has enabled a search for the most
distant supernovae to z~2.2. We have found four supernovae by searching spans
of integrations of the Ultra Deep Field and the Ultra Deep Field Parallels
taken with the Hubble Space Telescope paired with the Advanced Camera for
Surveys and the Near Infrared Multi Object Spectrometer. Interestingly, none of
these supernovae were at z>1.4, despite the substantially increased sensitivity
per unit area to such objects over the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey.
We present the optical photometric data for the four supernovae. We also show
that the low frequency of Type Ia supernovae observed at z>1.4 is statistically
consistent with current estimates of the global star formation history combined
with the non-trivial assembly time of SN Ia progenitors.",2005-03-04T06:31:49Z
Emission line variability of RS Ophiuchi,"We report that the H_alpha emission line of RS Oph was strongly variable
during our 2004 observations on a time scale of 1 month. The line consisted of
both a double peaked central narrow component (FWHM ~ 220 km/s) and a strongly
variable broad one (FWHM ~ 2000 km/s). The base of the H_alpha line was very
broad with FWZI 4600 km/s on all spectra from 1986 to 2004. The variability of
the broad component extends from -2000 to +2000 km/s. Most probably this is due
to either blobs ejected from the white dwarf (with a typical blob mass
estimated to be ~10^{-10} M_solar or a variable accretion disk wind.
  We also detected variability of the HeII4686 line on a time scale shorter
than 1 day. The possible origin is discussed.",2005-06-15T09:17:58Z
Energetics of Coronal Mass Ejections,"We examine the energetics of the best examples of flux-rope CMEs observed by
LASCO in 1996-2001. We find that 69% of the CMEs in our sample experience a
driving power in the LASCO field of view. For these CMEs which are driven, we
examine if they might be deriving most of their driving energy by coupling to
the solar wind. We do not find conclusive evidence to support this hypothesis.
We adopt two different methods to estimate the energy that can possibly be
released by the internal magnetic fields of the CMEs. We find that the internal
magnetic fields are a viable source of driving power for these CMEs.",2005-02-03T04:58:50Z
"Reconstructing the Triaxial Shapes of Dark Matter Halos from the
  Anisotropic Spatial Distributions of their Substructures in the Concordance
  Cosmology","We develop an algorithm to reconstruct the triaxial shapes of dark matter
halos from the anisotropic spatial distributions of their substructures for the
concordance background cosmology. First, we construct an analytic model for the
anisotropic spatial distribution of dark halo substructures under the
assumption that the tidal field with non-zero trace in the triaxial mass
distribution of the host halos generates the substructure bulk motions toward
the major principal axes of the hosts. Our analytic model implies that the
degree of anisotropy depends sensitively on the triaxiality of the host halos
as well as the correlation between the substructure locations and the tidal
shear field. Second, we set the axis ratios of the triaxial host halos as free
parameters in the analytic model, fit the model to the numerical results from
high-resolution N-body simulation of the concordance cosmology, and reconstruct
the two axis-ratios of the host halos from the best-fit values of the free
parameters. The comparison of the reconstructed axis ratios with the numerical
results reveals a good agreement. Finally, we conclude that our analytic model
may provide a physical understanding of the anisotropic spatial distribution of
dark halo substructures and a new way to reconstruct in principle the triaxial
shapes of dark matter halos from the observables.",2005-05-10T01:19:35Z
"Cluster number counts dependence on dark energy inhomogeneities and
  coupling to dark matter","Cluster number counts can be used to test dark energy models. We investigate
dark energy candidates which are coupled to dark matter. We analyze the cluster
number counts dependence on the amount of dark matter coupled to dark energy.
Further more, we study how dark energy inhomogeneities affect cluster
abundances. It is shown that increasing the coupling reduces significantly the
cluster number counts, and that dark energy inhomogeneities increases cluster
abundances. Wiggles in cluster number counts are shown to be a specific
signature of coupled dark energy models. Future observations will possibly
detect such oscillations and discriminate among the different dark energy
models.",2005-04-23T12:34:15Z
"The Warm, Cold and Very Cold Dusty Universe","We are living in a dusty universe: dust is ubiquitously seen in a wide
variety of astrophysical environments, ranging from circumstellar envelopes
around cool red giants to supernova ejecta, from diffuse and dense interstellar
clouds and star-forming regions to debris disks around main-sequence stars,
from comets to interplanetary space to distant galaxies and quasars. In this
review I focus on interstellar grains, with particular emphasis on the
extinction (absorption plus scattering) and emission properties of cold
submicron-sized ``classical'' grains which, in thermal equilibrium with the
ambient interstellar radiation field, obtain a steady-state temperature of
\~15--25K, warm nano-sized (or smaller) ""ultrasmall"" grains which are, upon
absorption of an energetic photon, transiently heated to temperatures as high
as a few hundred to over 1000K, and the possible existence of a population of
very cold (< 10K) dust. Whether dust grains can really get down to
""temperature"" less than the 2.7K cosmic microwave background radiation
temperature will also be discussed. The robustness of the
silicate-graphite-PAHs interstellar dust model is demonstrated by showing that
the infrared emission predicted from this model closely matches that observed
for the Milky Way, the Small Magellanic Cloud, and the ringed Sb galaxy

"Gemini and Chandra observations of Abell 586, a relaxed strong-lensing
  cluster","We analyze the mass content of the massive strong-lensing cluster Abell 586
($z = 0.17$). We use optical data (imaging and spectroscopy) obtained with the
Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) mounted on the 8-m Gemini-North
telescope, together with publicly available X-ray data taken with the
\textit{Chandra} space telescope. Employing different techniques -- velocity
distribution of galaxies, weak gravitational lensing, and X-ray spatially
resolved spectroscopy -- we derive mass and velocity dispersion estimates from
each of them. All estimates agree well with each other, within a 68% confidence
level, indicating a velocity dispersion of 1000 -- 1250 \kms. The projected
mass distributions obtained through weak-lensing and X-ray emission are
strikingly similar, having nearly circular geometry. We suggest that Abell 586
is probably a truly relaxed cluster, whose last major merger occurred more than
$\sim 4$ Gyr ago",2005-04-01T20:17:09Z
"On the origin of the X-ray emission towards the early Herbig Be star MWC
  297","We present high resolution AO-corrected coronographic near-infrared imaging
on the early-type Herbig Be star MWC 297. X-ray flaring has been reported
towards this young object, however this has been difficult to reconcile with
its early spectral type (B1.5) and relatively high mass (10 Msun). Our infrared
and X-ray analysis shows that the X-ray flaring is likely due to a late-type
star in the same field. The case of MWC 297 emphasizes the need for
coronographic imaging to address the reality of X-ray emission towards Herbig
Ae/Be stars, which is needed to understand the differences between low and
high-mass star formation.",2005-06-13T12:32:14Z
Braneworld black holes in cosmology and astrophysics,"The braneworld description of our universe entails a large extra dimension
and a fundamental scale of gravity that might be lower by several orders of
magnitude compared to the Planck scale. An interesting consequence of the
braneworld scenario is in the nature of spherically symmetric vacuum solutions
to the brane gravitational field equations which could represent black holes
with properties quite distinct compared to ordinary black holes in
4-dimensions. We discuss certain key features of some braneworld black hole
geometries. Such black holes are likely to have diverse cosmological and
astrophysical ramifications. The cosmological evolution of primordial
braneworld black holes is described highlighting their longevity due to
modified evaporation and effective accretion of radiation during the early
braneworld high energy era. Observational abundance of various evaporation
products of the black holes at different eras impose constraints on their
initial mass fraction. Surviving primordial black holes could be candidates of
dark matter present in galactic haloes. We discuss gravitational lensing by
braneworld black holes. Observables related to the relativistic images of
strong field gravitational lensing could in principle be used to distinguish
between different braneworld black hole metrics in future observations.",2005-03-22T14:01:25Z
"The Magnetic Properties of an L Dwarf Derived from Simultaneous Radio,
  X-ray, and H-alpha Observations","We present the first simultaneous, multi-wavelength observations of an L
dwarf, the L3.5 candidate brown dwarf 2MASS J00361617+1821104, conducted with
the Very Large Array, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the Kitt Peak 4-m
telescope. We detect strongly variable and periodic radio emission (P=3 hr)
with a fraction of about 60% circular polarization. No X-ray emission is
detected to a limit of L_X/L_{bol}<2e-5, several hundred times below the
saturation level observed in early M dwarfs. Similarly, we do not detect
H-alpha emission to a limit of L_{H-alpha}/L_{bol}<2e-7, the deepest for any L
dwarf observed to date. The ratio of radio to X-ray luminosity is at least four
orders of magnitude in excess of that observed in a wide range of active stars
(including M dwarfs) providing the first direct confirmation that late-M and L
dwarfs violate the radio/X-ray correlation. The radio emission is due to
gyrosynchrotron radiation in a large-scale magnetic field of about 175 G, which
is maintained on timescales longer than three years. The detected 3-hour period
may be due to (i) the orbital motion of a companion at a separation of about
five stellar radii, similar to the configuration of RS CVn systems, (ii) an
equatorial rotation velocity of about 37 km/s and an anchored, long-lived
magnetic field, or (iii) periodic release of magnetic stresses in the form of
weak flares. In the case of orbital motion, the magnetic activity may be
induced by the companion, possibly explaining the unusual pattern of activity
and the long-lived signal. We conclude that fully convective stars can maintain
a large-scale and stable magnetic field, but the lack of X-ray and H-alpha
emission indicates that the atmospheric conditions are markedly different than
in early-type stars and even M dwarfs. [abridged]",2005-02-18T21:00:50Z
B-Inflation,"We propose a novel model of inflation based on a large class of covariant
effective actions containing only the second derivatives of a scalar field. The
initial conditions leading to the inflationary solutions in this model are
rather generic. The graceful exit from the inflationary regime is natural once
the first order derivative terms are included.",2005-04-25T22:51:08Z
The Luminosity Function of X-ray Point Sources in Centaurus A,"We have studied the X-ray point source population of Centaurus A (NGC 5128)
using data from four archival CHANDRA observations. We detected 272 point-like
X-ray sources within a radius of 10 arcmin from the centre. Approximately half
of these are CXB sources, with the remaining half being LMXBs. The spatial
distribution of the LMXBs, both azimuthally averaged and 2-D, is consistent
with the distribution of the K-band light observed in the 2MASS survey. After
correction for the incompleteness effect we constrain the LMXB luminosity
function down to 2 times 10^{36} erg/s, much lower than previous studies of
LMXBs in elliptical galaxies. The obtained XLF flattens significantly below L_X
= 5 times 10^{37} erg/s and follows the dN/dL proportional to 1/L law in
agreement with the behaviour found earlier for LMXBs in the Milky Way and in
the bulge of M31.",2005-05-12T17:16:19Z
"QSO 0957+561 and other large-separated double quasars: some new results

QSOs, which however once were suspected as gravitationally lensed system. We
discuss some new results on time delay determinations including optical-radio

project for observations of the gravitational lens system UM425 is briefly
discussed.",2005-02-04T06:55:45Z
X-ray emission from young brown dwarfs in the Orion Nebula Cluster,"We use the sensitive X-ray data from the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project
(COUP) to study the X-ray properties of 34 spectroscopically-identified brown
dwarfs with near-infrared spectral types between M6 and M9 in the core of the
Orion Nebula Cluster. Nine of the 34 objects are clearly detected as X-ray
sources. The apparently low detection rate is in many cases related to the
substantial extinction of these brown dwarfs; considering only the BDs with
$A_V \leq 5$ mag, nearly half of the objects (7 out of 16) are detected in
X-rays. Our 10-day long X-ray lightcurves of these objects exhibit strong
variability, including numerous flares. While one of the objects was only
detected during a short flare, a statistical analysis of the lightcurves
provides evidence for continuous (`quiescent') emission in addition to flares
for all other objects. Of these, the $\sim$ M9 brown dwarf COUP 1255 = HC 212
is one of the coolest known objects with a clear detection of quiescent X-ray
emission. The X-ray properties (spectra, fractional X-ray luminosities, flare
rates) of these young brown dwarfs are similar to those of the low-mass stars
in the ONC, and thus there is no evidence for changes in the magnetic activity
around the stellar/substellar boundary, which lies at $\sim$ M6 for ONC
sources. Since the X-ray properties of the young brown dwarfs are also similar
to those of M6--M9 field stars, the key to the magnetic activity in very cool
objects seems to be the effective temperature, which determines the degree of
ionization in the atmosphere.",2005-06-02T08:40:21Z
"Swift, INTEGRAL, RXTE, and Spitzer reveal IGR J16283-4838","We present the first combined study of the recently discovered source IGR
J16283-4838 with Swift, INTEGRAL, and RXTE. The source, discovered by INTEGRAL
on April 7, 2005, shows a highly absorbed (variable N_H = 0.4 - 1.7 x 1e23
1/cm**2) and flat (photon index = 1) spectrum in the Swift/XRT and RXTE/PCA
data. No optical counterpart is detectable (V > 20 mag), but a possible
infrared counterpart within the Swift/XRT error radius is detected in the 2MASS
and Spitzer/GLIMPSE survey. The observations suggest that IGR J16283-4838 is a
high mass X-ray binary containing a neutron star embedded in Compton thick
material. This makes IGR J16283-4838 a member of the class of highly absorbed
HMXBs, discovered by INTEGRAL.",2005-06-08T14:29:40Z
Proper motion measurements as indicators of binarity in open clusters,"We analyze 9 open clusters with ages in the range 70 Myr to 3.2 Gyr using
UCAC2 proper motion data and 2MASS photometry. For each cluster we consider the
projected velocity distributions in the core and off-core regions separately.
In the projected velocity distribution of all sample clusters we find a
well-defined low-velocity peak, as well as an excess in the number of stars at
larger velocities. The low-velocity peak is accounted for by the random motion
of the single stars, while the high-velocity excess can be attributed to the
large velocity changes produced by a significant fraction of unresolved
binaries in a cluster. We derive kinematic parameters of the single-star
distribution, in particular the projected velocity dispersion. The relatively
large velocity dispersions derived in this work may reflect the non-virialized
state of the clusters. Based on the relative number of high-velocity (binary)
and single stars, we inferred for the sample clusters unresolved binary
fractions in the range $15%-54%$, for both core and off-core regions. The
present results suggest that care must be taken when applying proper-motion
filters to sort out members, especially binaries in a star cluster. This paper
shows that proper motions turn out to be a useful tool for identifying
high-velocity stars as unresolved binary cluster members, and as a consequence,
map and quantify the binary component in colour-magnitude diagrams.",2005-02-22T12:11:49Z
Evidence for isotropic emission in GRB991216,"The issue of the possible presence or absence of jets in GRBs is here
re-examined for GRB991216. We compare and contrast our theoretically predicted
afterglow luminosity in the 2-10 keV band for spherically symmetric versus
jetted emission. At these wavelenghts the jetted emission can be excluded and
data analysis confirms spherical symmetry. These theoretical fits are expected
to be improved by the forthcoming data of the Swift mission.",2005-03-11T16:51:02Z
The stars of the galactic center,"We consider the origin of the so-called S stars orbiting the supermassive
black hole at the very center of the Galaxy. These are usually assumed to be
massive main-sequence stars. We argue instead that they are the remnants of
low-to-intermediate mass red giants which have been scattered on to near-radial
orbits and tidally stripped as they approach the central black hole. Such stars
retain only low-mass envelopes and thus have high effective temperatures. Our
picture simultaneously explains why S stars have tightly-bound orbits, and the
observed depletion of red giants in the very center of the Galaxy.",2005-03-21T18:54:42Z
"Analysis of Strong Outbursts in Selected Blazars from the Metsahovi and
  UMRAO Monitoring Databases","Frequency-dependent time lags for strong outbursts in four gamma-blazars are
determined. The time lags for two adjacent outbursts in 2230+114 are correlated
with the outburst amplitudes. There is evidence that bright outbursts in
2230+114 appear with a quasi-period of (8.0 +- 0.3) yr.",2005-02-08T21:47:05Z
Resolution limits in astronomical images,"A method is introduced to derive resolution criteria for various a priori
defined templates of brightness distribution fitted to represent structures and
objects in astronomical images. The method is used for deriving criteria for
the minimum and maximum resolvable sizes of a template. The minimum resolvable
size of a template is determined by the ratio of (SNR-1)/SNR, and the maximum
detectable size is determined by the ratio of 1/SNR. Application of these
criteria is discussed in connection to data from filled-aperture instruments
and interferometers, accounting for different aperture shapes and the effects
of Fourier sampling, tapering, apodization and visibility weighting. Specific
resolution limits are derived for four different templates of brightness
distribution: (1) two-dimensional Gaussian, (2) optically thin spherical shell,
(3) disk of uniform brightness, and (4) ring. The limiting resolution for these
templates changes with SNR similarly to the quantum limit on resolution.
Practical application of the resolution limits is discussed in two examples
dealing with measurements of maximum brightness temperature in compact
relativistic jets and assessments of morphology of young supernova remnants.",2005-03-09T18:18:00Z
A Black Hole in the Galactic Center Complex IRS 13E?,"The IRS 13E complex is an unusual concentration of massive, early-type stars
at a projected distance of ~0.13 pc from the Milky Way's central supermassive
black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Because of their similar proper motion and
their common nature as massive, young stars it has recently been suggested that
IRS 13E may be the remnant of a massive stellar cluster containing an
intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) that binds its members gravitationally in
the tidal field of Sgr A*. Here, we present an analysis of the proper motions
in the IRS~13E environment that combines the currently best available data with
a time line of 10 years. We find that an IMBH in IRS 13E must have a minimum
mass of ~10^4 solar masses in order to bind the source complex gravitationally.
This high mass limit in combination with the absence so far of compelling
evidence for a non-thermal radio and X-ray source in IRS 13E make it appear
unlikely that an IMBH exists in IRS 13E that is sufficiently massive to bind
the system gravitationally.",2005-04-21T16:23:22Z
"Velocity Dispersion of 335 Galaxy Clusters Selected from the Sloan
  Digital Sky Survey: Statistical Evidence for Dynamical Interaction, and
  Against Ram-Pressure Stripping","There has been plenty of observational evidence of cluster galaxy evolution.
However, it has been difficult to identify the origin of the cluster galaxy
evolution. Here we show that gravitational interaction/friction between
galaxies is the statistically dominant physical mechanism responsible for the
cluster galaxy evolution, and that the well-favored ram-pressure stripping by
the cluster gas is not statistically driving the cluster galaxy evolution.
  We have constructed the largest composite cluster with 14548 member galaxies
out of 335 clusters with ~>300 km/s carefully selected from the SDSS. By
measuring velocity dispersions of various subsamples of galaxies in this
composite cluster, we found that bright cluster galaxies (Mz<-23) have
significantly smaller velocity dispersion than faint galaxies (Mz>-23). We
interpret this as direct evidence of the dynamical interaction/friction between
cluster galaxies, where massive galaxies lose their velocity through the energy
equipartition during the dynamical interaction/friction with less massive
galaxies. We also found that star-forming late-type galaxies have a larger
velocity dispersion than passive late-type galaxies. This is inconsistent with
the ram-pressure stripping model; since the ram-pressure is proportional to
sigma v^2 (i.e., stronger for galaxies with high velocity), the ram-pressure
stripping cannot explain the observed trends of passive (evolved) galaxies
having low velocity rather than high velocity. On the other hand, the result is
again consistent with the dynamical galaxy-galaxy interaction/friction, where
more evolved (passive) galaxies lose their velocity through dynamical
interaction/friction.",2005-03-03T21:00:22Z
Dynamics of assisted quintessence,"We explore the dynamics of assisted quintessence, where more than one scalar
field is present with the same potential. For potentials with tracking
solutions, the fields naturally approach the same values; in the context of
inflation this leads to the assisted inflation phenomenon where several fields
can cooperate to drive a period of inflation though none is able to
individually. For exponential potentials, we study the fixed points and their
stability confirming results already in the literature, and then carry out a
numerical analysis to show how assisted quintessence is realized. For inverse
power-law potentials, we find by contrast that there is no assisted behaviour;
indeed those are the unique (monotonic) potentials where several fields
together behave just as a single field in the same potential. More generally,
we provide an algorithm for generating a single-field potential giving
equivalent dynamics to multi-field assisted quintessence.",2005-06-03T13:30:30Z
"Towards a deterministic model of planetary formation. III. Mass
  distribution of short-period planets around stars of various masses","The origin of a recently discovered close-in Neptune-mass planet around GJ436
poses a challenge to the current theories of planet formation. Based on the
sequential accretion hypothesis and the standard theory of gap formation and
orbital migration, we show that around M dwarf stars, close-in Neptune-mass
ice-giant planets may be relatively common, while close-in Jupiter-mass
gas-giant planets are relatively rare. The mass distribution of close-in
planets generally has two peaks at about Neptune mass and Jupiter mass. The
lower-mass peak takes the maximum frequency for M dwarfs. Around more massive
solar-type stars (G dwarfs), the higher-mass peak is much more pronounced.
These are because planets tend to undergo type II migration after fully
accreting gas around G dwarfs while they tend to migrate faster than gas
accretion around M stars. Close-in Neptune-mass planets may also exist around G
dwarfs, though they tend to be mostly composed of silicates and iron cores and
their frequency is expected to be much smaller than that of Neptune-mass
planets around M dwarfs and that of gas giants around G dwarfs. We also show
that the conditions for planets' migration due to their tidal interaction with
the disk and the stellar-mass dependence in the disk-mass distribution can be
calibrated by the mass distribution of short-period planets around host stars
with various masses.",2005-02-28T08:34:54Z
Power Spectrum Estimation II. Linear Maximum Likelihood,"This second paper of two companion papers on the estimation of power spectra
specializes to the topic of estimating galaxy power spectra at large, linear
scales using maximum likelihood methods. As in the first paper, the aims are
pedagogical, and the emphasis is on concepts rather than technical detail. The
paper covers most of the salient issues, including selection functions,
likelihood functions, Karhunen-Loeve compression, pair-integral bias, Local
Group flow, angular or radial systematics (arising for example from
extinction), redshift distortions, quadratic compression, decorrelation, and
disentanglement. The procedures are illustrated with results from the IRAS PSCz
survey. Most of the PSCz graphics included in this paper have not been
published elsewhere.",2005-03-29T01:49:17Z
"Realistic Event Rates for Detection of Supermassive Black Hole
  Coalescence by LISA","The gravitational waves generated during supermassive black hole (SMBH)
coalescence are prime candidates for detection by the satellite LISA. We use
the extended Press-Schechter formalism combined with empirically motivated
estimates for the SMBH--dark matter halo mass relation and SMBH occupation
fraction to estimate the maximum coalescence rate for major SMBH mergers.
Assuming efficient binary coalescence, and guided by the lowest nuclear black
hole mass inferred in local galactic bulges and nearby low-luminosity active
galactic nuclei (10^5 Msun) we predict approximately 15 detections per year at
a signal to noise greater than five, in each of the inspiral and ringdown
phases. Rare coalescences between SMBHs having masses in excess of 10^7 Msun
will be more readily detected via gravitational waves from the ringdown phase.",2005-03-09T12:00:08Z
"The HIPASS Catalogue: III - Optical Counterparts & Isolated Dark

are members of galaxy groups. From these multiple galaxy matches, 714 (16%)
have confirmed optical velocities and a further 258 (6%) galaxies are without
confirmed velocities. For 481 (11%), multiple galaxies are present but no
single optical counterpart can be chosen and 216 (5%) have no obvious optical
galaxy present. Most of these 'blank fields' are in crowded fields along the
Galactic plane or have high extinctions.
  Isolated 'Dark galaxy' candidates are investigated using an extinction cut of
ABj < 1 mag and the blank fields category. Of the 3692 galaxies with an ABj
extinction < 1 mag, only 13 are also blank fields. Of these, 12 are eliminated
either with follow-up Parkes observations or are in crowded fields. The
remaining one has a low surface brightness optical counterpart. Hence, no
isolated optically dark galaxies have been found within the limits of the
Hipass survey.",2005-05-30T06:33:29Z
A Unified Model for Gamma-Ray Bursts,"A possible unified model of short and long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), X-ray
rich GRBs, and X-ray flashes is proposed. It is assumed that the jet of a GRB
consists of many emitting sub-shells (i.e., an inhomogeneous jet model). The
multiplicity of the sub-shells along a line of sight n_s is an important
parameter. If n_s is large (>>1) the event looks like a long GRB, while if
n_s=1, the event looks like a short GRB. Finally, when n_s=0, the event looks
like an X-ray flash or an X-ray rich GRB. Furthermore, our model may also
explain the bimodal distributions of T90 duration of BATSE-GRBs. Clearly, our
model predicts that short GRBs should be associated with energetic SNe.",2005-02-23T03:00:45Z
"First and second-type self-similar solutions of implosions and
  explosions containing ultra-relativistic shocks","We derive self similar solutions for ultra-relativistic shock waves
propagating into cold material of powerlaw density profile in radius rho ~
r^-k. We treat both implosions and explosions in three geometries: planar,
cylindrical and spherical. For spherical explosions these are the first type
solutions of Blandford and McKee for k<4 and the second type solutions found by
Best and Sari for k>5-sqrt(3/4). In addition we find new, hollow (with
evacuated interior), first type solutions that may be applicable for 4<k<17/4.
This ``sequence'' with increasing k of first type solutions, hollow first type
solutions, and then second type solutions is reminiscent of the
non-relativistic sequence. However, while in the non relativistic case there is
a range of k which corresponds to a ``gap'' - a range in $k$ with neither first
nor second type solutions which separates the hollow first type solutions and
the second type solutions, here there is an ``overlap'': a range of k for which
current considerations allow for both hollow first and second type solutions.
Further understanding is needed to determine which of the two solutions apply
in this overlap regime. We provide similar exploration for the other geometries
and for imploding configurations. Interestingly, we find a gap for imploding
spherical shocks and exploding planar shocks and an overlap for imploding
planar solutions. Cylindrical configurations have no hollow solutions and
exhibit direct transition from first type to second type solutions, without a
gap or an overlap region.",2005-05-09T21:02:18Z
Neutralino annihilation in the Large Magellanic Cloud,"I present results with respect to the gamma-ray and synchrotron fluxes due to

"COSMOGRAIL: the COSmological MOnitoring of GRAvItational Lenses I. How
  to sample the light curves of gravitationally lensed quasars to measure
  accurate time delays","We use numerical simulations to test a broad range of plausible observational
strategies designed to measure the time delay between the images of
gravitationally lensed quasars. Artificial quasar light curves are created
along with Monte-Carlo simulations in order to determine the best temporal
sampling to adopt when monitoring the photometric variations of systems with
time delays between 5 and 120 days, i.e., always shorter than the visibility
window across the year. Few and realistic assumptions are necessary on the
quasar photometric variations (peak-to-peak amplitude and time-scale of the
variations) and on the accuracy of the individual photometric points. The
output of the simulations is the (statistical) relative error made on the time
delay measurement, as a function of 1- the object visibility over the year, 2-
the temporal sampling of the light curves and 3- the time delay. Also
investigated is the effect of long term microlensing variations which must be
below the 5 % level (either intrinsically or by subtraction) if the goal is to
measure time delays with an accuracy of 1-2 %. However, while microlensing
increases the random error on the time delay, it does not significantly
increase the systematic error, which is always a factor 5 to 10 smaller than
the random error. Finally, it is shown that, when the time delay is comparable
to the visibility window of the object, a logarithmic sampling can
significantly improve the time delay determination. All results are presented
in the form of compact plots to be used to optimize the observational strategy
of future monitoring programs.",2005-03-01T15:05:55Z
"Modeling optical properties of cosmic dust grains using a distribution
  of hollow spheres","In this paper we study the combined effects of size and shape of small solid
state particles on the absorption, emission and scattering characteristics. We
use the statistical approach to calculate these optical properties. In this
approach the average optical properties of an ensemble of particles in random
orientation are represented by the average optical properties of an ensemble of
simple shapes. The validity of this approach is studied in detail for a uniform
distribution of hollow spheres where the fractional volume of the central
inclusion is varied. We apply the results to two different areas of interest,
i) infrared spectroscopy and ii) polarization of scattered light. The effects
of particle size and shape on the optical characteristics are discussed. We
compare the results using the distribution of hollow spheres with those
obtained by using randomly oriented spheroids. Also we compare the results with
observations and laboratory measurements. The distribution of hollow spheres is
very successful in reproducing laboratory measurements of the scattering angle
distribution of the degree of linear polarization for incident unpolarized
light of randomly oriented irregular quartz particles. Furthermore, we show
that we are able to derive the size distribution of dust grains by fitting the
measured degree of linear polarization using computational result for hollow
spheres. It is shown that the distribution of hollow spheres is a powerful tool
for studying light scattering, absorption and emission by cosmic dust grains
and in particular when large numbers of particle parameters need to be
considered since the computational demand of the distribution of hollow spheres
is small.",2005-03-03T12:35:15Z
"An exceptionally bright flare from SGR1806-20 and the origins of
  short-duration gamma-ray bursts","Soft-gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) are galactic X-ray stars that emit numerous
short-duration (about 0.1 s) bursts of hard X-rays during sporadic active
periods. They are thought to be magnetars: strongly magnetized neutron stars
with emissions powered by the dissipation of magnetic energy. Here we report
the detection of a long (380 s) giant flare from SGR 1806-20, which was much
more luminous than any previous transient event observed in our Galaxy. (In the
first 0.2 s, the flare released as much energy as the Sun radiates in a quarter
of a million years.) Its power can be explained by a catastrophic instability
involving global crust failure and magnetic reconnection on a magnetar, with
possible large-scale untwisting of magnetic field lines outside the star. From
a great distance this event would appear to be a short-duration, hard-spectrum
cosmic gamma-ray burst. At least a significant fraction of the mysterious
short-duration gamma-ray bursts therefore may come from extragalactic
magnetars.",2005-02-16T21:22:19Z
"Luminosity-Dependent Quasar Lifetimes: Reconciling the Optical and X-ray
  Quasar Luminosity Functions","We consider implications of our new model of quasar lifetimes and light
curves for the quasar luminosity function (LF) at different frequencies and
redshifts. In our picture, quasars evolve rapidly and the lifetime depends on
both their instantaneous and peak luminosities. The bright end of the LF traces
the peak intrinsic quasar activity, but the faint end consists of quasars which
are either undergoing exponential growth to much larger masses and
luminosities, or are in sub-Eddington quiescent states going into or coming out
of a period of peak activity. The 'break' in the observed LF corresponds
directly to the maximum in the intrinsic distribution of peak luminosities,
which falls off at both brighter and fainter luminosities. We study this model
using simulations of galaxy mergers which successfully reproduce a wide range
of observed quasar phenomena, including the observed column density
distribution. By combining quasar lifetimes and the distribution of maximum
quasar luminosities determined from the observed hard X-ray LF with the
corresponding luminosity and host-system dependent column densities, we produce
the expected soft X-ray and B-band LFs. Our predictions agree exceptionally
well with the observed LFs at all observed luminosities, over the redshift
range considered (z < 1), without invoking any ad hoc assumptions about an
obscured population of sources. Our results also suggest that observed
correlations in hard X-ray samples between the obscured fraction of quasars and
luminosity can be explained in the context of our model by the expulsion of
surrounding gas due to heating from accretion feedback energy as a quasar nears
its peak luminosity and final black hole mass.",2005-04-11T20:03:56Z
"Testing the accuracy of the Hydro-PM approximation in numerical
  simulations of the Lyman-alpha forest","We implement the hydro-PM (HPM) technique (Gnedin & Hui 1998) in the
hydrodynamical simulation code GADGET-II and quantify the differences between
this approximate method and full hydrodynamical simulations of the Lyman-alpha
forest in a concordance LCDM model. At redshifts z=3 and z=4, the differences
between the gas and dark matter (DM) distributions, as measured by the
one-point distribution of density fluctuations, the density power spectrum and
the flux power spectrum, systematically decrease with increasing resolution of
the HPM simulqation. However, reducing these differences to less than a few
percent requires a significantly larger number of grid-cells than particles,
with a correspondingly larger demand for memory. Significant differences in the
flux decrement distribution remain even for very high resolution hydro-PM
simulations, particularly at low redshift. At z=2, the differences between the
flux power spectra obtained from HPM simulations and full hydrodynamical
simulations are generally large and of the order of 20-30 %, and do not
decrease with increasing resolution of the HPM simulation. This is due to the
presence of large amounts of shock-heated gas, a situation which is not
adequately modelled by the HPM approximation. We confirm the results of Gnedin
& Hui (1998) that the statistical properties of the flux distribution are
discrepant by > 5-20 % when compared to full hydrodynamical simulations. The
discrepancies in the flux power spectrum are strongly scale- and
redshift-dependent and extend to large scales. Considerable caution is needed
in attempts to use calibrated HPM simulations for quantitative predictions of
the flux power spectrum and other statistical properties of the Lyman-alpha
forest.",2005-04-28T17:17:18Z
"Asteroseismology of the Beta Cephei star Nu Eridani -- IV. The 2003-4
  multisite photometric campaign and the combined 2002-4 data","The second multisite photometric campaign devoted to Nu Eri is reported. For
Nu Eri, analysis of the new data adds four independent frequencies to the nine
derived previously from the 2002-3 data, three in the range from 7.20 to 7.93
c/d, and a low one, equal to 0.614 c/d. Combining the new and the old data
results in two further independent frequencies, equal to 6.7322 and 6.2236 c/d.
Altogether, the oscillation spectrum is shown to consist of 12 high frequencies
and two low ones. The latter have u amplitudes about twice as large as the v
and y amplitudes, a signature of high radial-order g modes. Thus, the
suggestion that Nu Eri is both a Beta Cephei and an SPB star, put forward on
the basis of the first campaign's data, is confirmed.
  Nine of the 12 high frequencies form three triplets, of which two are new.
The triplets represent rotationally split l=1 modes, although in case of the
smallest-amplitude one this may be questioned. Mean separations and asymmetries
of the triplets are derived with accuracy sufficient for meaningful comparison
with models.
  The first comparison star, Mu Eri, is shown to be an SPB variable with an
oscillation spectrum consisting of six frequencies, three of which are
equidistant in period. The star is also found to be an eclipsing variable. The
eclipse is a transit, probably total, the secondary is fainter than the primary
by several magnitudes, and the system is widely detached.
  The second comparison star, Xi Eri, is confirmed to be a Delta Scuti
variable. To the frequency of 10.8742 c/d seen already in the first campaign's
data, another one, equal to 17.2524 c/d, is added.",2005-04-11T12:27:03Z
Cosmological constraints on a classical limit of quantum gravity,"We investigate the cosmology of a recently proposed deformation of Einstein
gravity, emerging from quantum gravity heuristics. The theory is constructed to
have de Sitter space as a vacuum solution, and thus to be relevant to the
accelerating universe. However, this solution turns out to be unstable, and the
true phase space of cosmological solutions is significantly more complex,
displaying two late-time power-law attractors -- one accelerating and the other
dramatically decelerating. It is also shown that non-accelerating cosmologies
sit on a separatrix between the two basins of attraction of these attractors.
Hence it is impossible to pass from a decelerating cosmology to an accelerating
one, as required in standard cosmology for consistency with nucleosynthesis and
structure formation and compatibility with the data inferred from supernovae
Ia. We point out that alternative models of the early universe, such as the one
investigated here might provide possible ways to circumvent these requirements.",2005-06-16T18:55:00Z
Cepheid pulsation models at varying metallicity and DY/DZ,"In this paper we present an extended set of nonlinear convective pulsation
models at varying the metallicity and DY/DZ ratio. The predicted instability
strip and bolometric light curves are discussed by comparing the new models
with our previous ones. In particular, the dependence on both metal and helium
abundances is investigated. By transforming the bolometric light curves into
the observational bands we are able to derive both Period-Color-Luminosity and
Wesenheit relations for each selected chemical composition. Synthetic
Period-Luminosity relations are obtained by populating the instability strip
according to specific assumptions on the number of pulsators and the mass
distribution. These theoretical results are compared with recent accurate data
by Sandage et al. and Kervella et al., in order to test the predictive
capabilities of the models. We confirm our previous results that the
theoretical metallicity correction to the Key Project Cepheid distance scale
depends both on the period range and DY/DZ ratio, becoming important for
periods longer than 20 days and DY/DZ > 1.5.",2005-06-09T14:35:02Z

is approximately 5 years, and this makes it an excellent candidate for a
precise mass measurement.",2005-03-29T03:39:07Z
"A New Relation between GRB Rest-Frame Spectra and Energetics and Its
  Utility on Cosmology","We investigate the well-measured spectral and energetic properties of 20
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in their cosmological rest frames. We find a tight
relation between the isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray energy Eiso, the local peak
energy E'p of the \nu F_{\nu} spectrum, and the local break time t'b of the GRB
afterglow light curve, which reads Eiso*t'b\propto E'p^{1.95\pm0.08}
(\chi^2_\nu=1.40; Omega_M=0.27, Omega_Lambda=0.73). Such a power-law relation
can be understood via the high-energy radiation processes for the GRB prompt
emission accompanying the beaming effects. We then consider this relation as an
intrinsic one for the observed GRB sample, and obtain a constraint on the mass
density Omega_M=0.24^{+0.16}_{-0.12} (1\sigma) for a flat Lambda-CDM universe,
and a \chi^2_{dof}=1.33 for Omega_M\approx0.3 and Omega_Lambda\approx0.7.
Ongoing GRB observations in the Swift era are expected to confirm this relation
and make its cosmological utility progress much.",2005-04-03T11:02:35Z
"Towards a physical model of dust tori in Active Galactic Nuclei -
  Radiative transfer calculations for a hydrostatic torus model","We explore physically self-consistent models of dusty molecular tori in
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with the goal of interpreting VLTI observations
and fitting high resolution mid-IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The
input dust distribution is analytically calculated by assuming hydrostatic
equilibrium between pressure forces - due to the turbulent motion of the gas
clouds - and gravitational and centrifugal forces as a result of the
contribution of the nuclear stellar distribution and the central black hole.
For a fully three-dimensional treatment of the radiative transfer problem
through the tori we employ the Monte Carlo code MC3D. We find that in
homogeneous dust distributions the observed mid-infrared emission is dominated
by the inner funnel of the torus, even when observing along the equatorial
plane. Therefore, the stratification of the distribution of dust grains - both
in terms of size and composition - cannot be neglected. In the current study we
only include the effect of different sublimation radii which significantly
alters the SED in comparison to models that assume an average dust grain
property with a common sublimation radius, and suppresses the silicate emission
feature at 9.7 micron. In this way we are able to fit the mean SED of both type
I and type II AGN very well. Our fit of special objects for which high angular
resolution observations (less than 0.3 arcseconds) are available indicates that
the hottest dust in NGC 1068 reaches the sublimation temperature while the
maximum dust temperature in the low-luminosity AGN Circinus falls short of 1000
K.",2005-04-05T12:23:04Z
Low Luminosity Companions to White Dwarfs,"This paper presents results of a near-infrared imaging survey for low mass
stellar and substellar companions to white dwarfs. A wide field proper motion
survey of 261 white dwarfs was capable of directly detecting companions at
orbital separations between $\sim100$ and 5000 AU with masses as low as 0.05
$M_{\odot}$, while a deep near field search of 86 white dwarfs was capable of
directly detecting companions at separations between $\sim50$ and 1100 AU with
masses as low as 0.02 $M_{\odot}$. Additionally, all white dwarf targets were
examined for near-infrared excess emission, a technique capable of detecting
companions at arbitrarily close separations down to masses of 0.05 $M_{\odot}$.
  No brown dwarf candidates were detected, which implies a brown dwarf
companion fraction of $<0.5$% for white dwarfs. In contrast, the stellar
companion fraction of white dwarfs as measured by this survey is 22%,
uncorrected for bias. Moreover, most of the known and suspected stellar
companions to white dwarfs are low mass stars whose masses are only slightly
greater than the masses of brown dwarfs. Twenty previously unknown stellar
companions were detected, five of which are confirmed or likely white dwarfs
themselves, while fifteen are confirmed or likely low mass stars.
  Similar to the distribution of cool field dwarfs as a function of spectral
type, the number of cool unevolved dwarf companions peaks at mid-M type. Based
on the present work, relative to this peak, field L dwarfs appear to be roughly
2-3 times more abundant than companion L dwarfs. Additionally, there is no
evidence that the initial companion masses have been altered by post main
sequence binary interactions.",2005-06-01T13:02:54Z
Mass Loss Due to Sputtering and Thermal Processes in Meteoroid Ablation,"Conventional meteoroid theory assumes that the dominant mode of ablation is
by evaporation following intense heating during atmospheric flight. In this
paper we consider the question of whether sputtering may provide an alternative
disintegration process of some importance.For meteoroids in the mass range from
10^-3 to 10^-13 kg and covering a meteor velocity range from 11 to 71 km/s, we
numerically modeled both thermal ablation and sputtering ablation during
atmospheric flight. We considered three meteoroid models believed to be
representative of asteroidal (3300 kg m^-3 mass density), cometary (1000 kg
m^-3) and porous cometary (300 kg m^-3) meteoroid structures. Atmospheric
profiles which considered the molecular compositions at different heights were
used in the sputtering calculations. We find that while in many cases
(particularly at low velocities and for relatively large meteoroid masses)
sputtering contributes only a small amount of mass loss during atmospheric
flight, in some cases sputtering is very important. For example, a 10^-10 kg
porous meteoroid at 40 km/s will lose nearly 51% of its mass by sputtering,
while a 10^-13 kg asteroidal meteoroid at 60 km/s will lose nearly 83% of its
mass by sputtering. We argue that sputtering may explain the light production
observed at very great heights in some Leonid meteors. The impact of this work
will be most dramatic for very small meteoroids such as those observed with
large aperture radars.",2005-05-13T15:16:23Z
"Quantum corrections to slow roll inflation and new scaling of
  superhorizon fluctuations","Precise cosmological data from WMAP and forthcoming CMB experiments motivate
the study of the quantum corrections to the slowroll inflationary parameters.We
find the quantum (loop) corrections to the equations of motion of the classical
inflaton, its quantum fluctuations and the Friedmann equation in general single
field slow roll inflation.We implement a renormalized effective field theory
EFT approach based on an expansion in (H/M_{Pl})^2 and slow roll parameters
epsilon_V,eta_V,sigma_V, xi_V.We find that the leading order quantum
corrections to the inflaton effective potential and its equation of motion are
determined by the power spectrum of scalar fluctuations. Its near scale
invariance introduces a strong infrared behavior naturally regularized by the
slow roll parameter Delta = eta_V-epsilon_V=(n_s-1)/2+r/8.To leading order in
the EFT and slow roll expansions we find
V_{eff}(Phi_0)=V_R(Phi_0)[1+(Delta^2_T/32)(n_s-1+3r/8) /(n_s-1+r/4)+higher
orders]where n_s and r=Delta^2_T/Delta^2_R are the CMB observables that depend
implicitly on Phi_0, and V_R(Phi_0) is the renormalized classical inflaton
potential.This effective potential during slow roll inflation is strikingly
different from the Minkowski space-time result.Superhorizon scalar field
fluctuations grow for late times eta -> 0^- as |\eta|^{-1+Delta-d_} where d_ is
a novel quantum correction to the scaling exponent related to the self decay of
superhorizon inflaton fluctuations eta is the conformal time. We generalize
this to the case of the inflaton interacting with a light scalar field. These
quantum corrections arising from interactions will compete with higher order
slow-roll corrections and must be taken into account for the precision
determination of inflationary parameters.",2005-03-30T17:35:00Z
"On the Extreme Positive Feedback Star-Forming Mode from Massive and
  Compact Superstar Clusters","The force of gravity acting within the volume occupied by young, compact and
massive superstar clusters, is here shown to drive in situ all the matter
deposited by winds and supernovae into several generations of star formation.
These events are promoted by radiative cooling which drains the thermal energy
of the ejected gas causing its accumulation to then rapidly exceed the
gravitational instability criterion. A detailed account of the integrated
ionizing radiation and mechanical luminosity as a function of time is here
shown to lead to a new stationary solution. In this, the mass deposition rate
$\dot M$, instead of causing a wind as in the adiabatic solution, turns into a
positive feedback star-forming mode equal to the star formation rate. Some of
the implications of this extreme positive feedback mode are discussed.",2005-06-13T17:44:11Z
"Aten-Alinda orbital evolution: the example of possible interacting
  orbits","Minor planets 887 Alinda and 2062 Aten are typical near Earth asteroids
(NEA). Our previous researches show their possible origin in catastrophic
collision near Earth orbit. It is determine the target of present research --
to investigate interactions between these objects in more details. Orbits m.p.
887 and 2062 are crossed near pericenter and apocenter accordingly. So possible
interval of the interaction of these objects is repeated through the
significant time interval and has relatively small duration. On the strength of
several reasons, orbits of fragments of the disastrous collision can have no an
exact intersection. Besides, when integrating on the greater gap in the past
increases a role of the uncertainty of initial values of elements of orbits.
These factors determine a probabilistic nature of the result as well as need of
modeling of the disastrous process. However, on the strength of the specific
spatial location of orbits, result has highly determined numeric expression -
in the suggestion on the possible interaction m. p. 887 and 2062, this event
has occurred about 1400 years ago. The possible participation some other near
Earth minor objects, include Quadrantides meteoric stream, in described
disastrous event is discussed.",2005-05-16T10:03:41Z
Strong mean field dynamos require supercritical helicity fluxes,"Several one and two dimensional mean field models are analyzed where the
effects of current helicity fluxes and boundaries are included within the
framework of the dynamical quenching model. In contrast to the case with
periodic boundary conditions, the final saturation energy of the mean field
decreases inversely proportional to the magnetic Reynolds number. If a
nondimensional scaling factor in the current helicity flux exceeds a certain
critical value, the dynamo can operate even without kinetic helicity, i.e. it
is based only on shear and current helicity fluxes, as first suggested by
Vishniac & Cho (2001, ApJ 550, 752). Only above this threshold is the current
helicity flux also able to alleviate catastrophic quenching. The fact that
certain turbulence simulations have now shown apparently non-resistively
limited mean field saturation amplitudes may be suggestive of the current
helicity flux having exceeded this critical value. Even below this critical
value the field still reaches appreciable strength at the end of the kinematic
phase, which is in qualitative agreement with dynamos in periodic domains.
However, for large magnetic Reynolds numbers the field undergoes subsequent
variations on a resistive time scale when, for long periods, the field can be
extremely weak.",2005-05-23T19:41:59Z
"The Interpretation of Inertial Force and The Existence of Absolute
  Background","The formalism of classical particle dynamics is reinvestigated according to
the basic requirement of causal consistency, and a new equation of particle
dynamics, which is more general and more in line with classical mechanics
experiments than Newton's second law, is obtained. More importantly, the
inertial frame of reference is no longer required and the inertial force is no
longer introduced by hand. The new dynamical equation can be straightforwardly
applied in any reference frame as long as which is irrotational with respect to
the absolute background of the universe. The nature of the inertial force is
nothing but the real forces acting on the reference object. The essence of this
reform of classical particle dynamics is just a drawback of traditional
formalism in Newtonian mechanics being corrected. However, it may be more
important that a logical derivation of this new particle dynamics equation
strongly suggests the existence of an absolute background for the whole space
of the universe. In physical concepts, the absolute background for space does
not conflict with the relative length of the base unit of space in Einstein's
Special Relativity and General Relativity. Furthermore, the size of the base
unit of space should essentially be understood as the length of the line
segment, which is cut from the absolute background of space by the intrinsic
physical events.",2005-02-13T15:34:39Z
Radio Emission from Anisotropic Electron Distributions,"The effect of pitch-angle anisotropy of fast electrons on generation of
nonthermal radio emission is studied. Incoherent gyrosynchrotron radiation is
shown to depend strongly on the anisotropy. In particular, the spectral index
of gyrosynchrotron radiation increases up to a factor of 3-4 compared with the
isotropic case. The degree of polarization (X-mode) increases for loss-cone
distributions, while decreases for beam-like distributions. Ample evidence of
the pitch-angle anisotropy effect on (1) spatial distribution of the radio
brightness, (2) spatially resolved light curves of the intensity and
polarization, (3) spectral hardness of microwave bursts, is found by exploring
observations performed with Nobeyama Radioheliograph and Owens Valley Solar
Array. Above some threshold in the angular gradient, the electron cyclotron
maser instability (coherent gyrosynchrotron emission) can develop, provided
that standard gyrosynchrotron emission is accompanied by a lower-frequency
intense coherent emission. The coherent emission is studied in detail for a
realistic distribution of fast electrons over the energy and pitch-angle. In
agreement with observations of narrowband radio spikes, it is found that (1)
hard (power-law) distributions over energy are preferable to produce the
coherent emission, (2) the threshold of the instability corresponds to quite an
anisotropic electron distribution, thus, the pitch-angle anisotropy derived
from the properties of the continuum gyrosynchrotron radiation will not
necessarily give rise to coherent emission (either enhanced isotropization
implied by quasilnear saturation of the instability).",2005-05-08T02:02:31Z
"Galactic modulation of extragalactic cosmic rays: Possible origin of the
  knee in the cosmic ray spectrum","The existence of the spectral break around $\sim 3 \times 10^{15}$ eV in the
cosmic ray spectrum (referred to as the `knee') is one of the biggest questions
in cosmic ray astrophysics. At the same time, the origin of cosmic rays above
the knee energies (between 10$^{15}$ and 10$^{18}$ eV) is also still unsettled.
In this paper, we investigate how the hypothetical extragalactic CRs after
modulated by the galactic wind contribute to the knee in the CR spectrum. We
numerically calculate the modulated energy spectrum of the hypothetical cosmic
rays coming into the galaxy from just outside of the ``galactic sphere'' where
the galactic wind terminates. We show that the observed knee structure is
reproduced well by a superposition of the modulated component and the galactic
cosmic rays originating in supernova remnants.",2005-02-07T08:57:02Z
Formation and Evolution of Supermassive Black Holes,"The correlation between the mass of supermassive black holes in galaxy nuclei
and the mass of the galaxy spheroids or bulges (or more precisely their central
velocity dispersion), suggests a common formation scenario for galaxies and
their central black holes. The growth of bulges and black holes can commonly
proceed through external gas accretion or hierarchical mergers, and are both
related to starbursts. Internal dynamical processes control and regulate the
rate of mass accretion. Self-regulation and feedback are the key of the
correlation. It is possible that the growth of one component, either BH or
bulge, takes over, breaking the correlation, as in Narrow Line Seyfert 1
objects. The formation of supermassive black holes can begin early in the
universe, from the collapse of Population III, and then through gas accretion.
The active black holes can then play a significant role in the re-ionization of
the universe. The nuclear activity is now frequently invoked as a feedback to
star formation in galaxies, and even more spectacularly in cooling flows. The
growth of SMBH is certainly there self-regulated. SMBHs perturb their local
environment, and the mergers of binary SMBHs help to heat and destroy central
stellar cusps. The interpretation of the X-ray background yields important
constraints on the history of AGN activity and obscuration, and the census of
AGN at low and at high redshifts reveals the downsizing effect, already
observed for star formation. History appears quite different for bright QSO and
low-luminosity AGN: the first grow rapidly at high z, and their number density
decreases then sharply, while the density of low-luminosity objects peaks more
recently, and then decreases smoothly.",2005-05-22T17:16:38Z
GCRT J1745-3009: A precessing radio pulsar?,"A unique transient bursting radio source, GCRT J1745-3009, has been
discovered (Hyman et al. 2005a) near the direction of the Galactic center. It
is still an open question to explain this phenomenon, although some efforts to
understand its nature have been made. This paper shows that most of the
observed features can be reproduced by our proposed precessing pulsar model. It
is found that the precession angle of the pulsar should be larger ($\ga 15^{\rm
o}$) than that of previously known precessing pulsars, which have a precession
angle $\la 10^{\rm o}$, if the beam width of the pulsar is larger than 10
degree. The pulsar could be a nulling (or even extremely) radio pulsars to
account for the transient nature of the source. This model can be confirmed if
a pulsar is detected at the position of the source. The pulsar could hardly be
a normal neutron star (but probably a solid quark star) if the spin period of
the pulsar is detected to be $\ga 10$ ms in the future.",2005-04-11T19:31:40Z
Spitzer Imaging of i'-drop Galaxies: Old Stars at z~6,"We present new evidence for mature stellar populations with ages >100Myr in
massive galaxies (M_stellar>10^10M_sun) seen at a time when the Universe was
less than 1Gyr old. We analyse the prominent detections of two z~6 star-forming
galaxies (SBM03#1 & #3) made at wavelengths corresponding to the rest-frame
optical using the IRAC camera onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. We had
previously identified these galaxies in HST/ACS GOODS images of Chandra Deep
Field South through the ""i-drop"" Lyman break technique, and subsequently
confirmed spectroscopically with the Keck telescope. The new Spitzer photometry
reveals significant Balmer/4000Ang discontinuities, indicative of dominant
stellar populations with ages >100Myr. Fitting a range of population synthesis
models (for normal initial mass functions) to the HST/Spitzer photometry yields
ages of 250-650Myr and implied formation redshifts z~7.5-13.5 in
presently-accepted world models. Remarkably, our sources have best-fit stellar
masses of 1.3-3.8x10^10M_sun (95% confidence) assuming a Salpeter initial mass
function. This indicates that at least some galaxies with stellar masses >20%
of those of a present-day L* galaxy had already assembled within the first Gyr
after the Big Bang. We also deduce that the past average star formation rate
must be comparable to the current observed rate (SFR_UV~5-30M_sun/yr),
suggesting that there may have been more vigorous episodes of star formation in
such systems at higher redshifts. Although a small sample, limited primarily by
Spitzer's detection efficiency, our result lends support to the hypothesis
advocated in our earlier analyses of the Ultra Deep Field and GOODS HST/ACS
data. The presence of established systems at z~6 suggests long-lived sources at
earlier epochs (z>7) played a key role in reionizing the Universe.",2005-02-18T21:04:30Z
Two Pulsar Wind Nebulae: Chandra/XMM-Newton Imaging of GeV J1417-6100,"We report on Chandra ACIS and XMM-Newton MOS/PN imaging observations of two
pulsar wind nebulae (K3/PSR J1420-6048 and G313.3+0.1=`the rabbit') associated
with the Galactic unidentified gamma-ray source GeV J1417-6100. With the
excellent ACIS imaging, the very energetic pulsar PSR J1420-6048 is separated
from its surrounding nebula. This nebula has surprisingly little compact
structure, although a faint arc is seen near the pulsar. Similarly, two point
sources are resolved in the rabbit nebula. The large XMM-Newton collecting area
provides useful spectral constraints on the rabbit and the associated point
sources. Based on spectra and X-ray morphology, we identify one point source as
a plausible pulsar counterpart. Large backgrounds and low source counts limited
pulse search sensitivities, but we report pulse upper limits and a candidate
108ms period for the rabbit pulsar based on the XMM-Newton data and an ACIS CC
observation. Comparison of the X-ray images with high resolution ATCA radio
maps shows that the non-thermal X-ray emission corresponds well with the radio
structure.",2005-03-31T02:31:31Z
"10^{-7} contrast ratio at 4.5Lambda/D: New results obtained in
  laboratory experiments using nano-fabricated coronagraph and multi-Gaussian
  shaped pupil masks","We present here new experimental results on high contrast imaging of 10^{-7}
at 4.5Lambda/D (Lambda = 0.820 microns) by combining a circular focal plane
mask (coronagraph) of 2.5Lambda/D diameter and a multi-Gaussian pupil plane
mask. Both the masks were fabricated on very high surface quality (Lambda/30)
BK7 optical substrates using nano-fabrication techniques of photolithography
and metal lift-off. This process ensured that the shaped masks have a useable
edge roughness better than Lambda/4 (rms error better than 0.2 microns), a
specification that is necessary to realize the predicted theoretical limits of
any mask design. Though a theoretical model predicts a contrast level of
10^{-12}, the background noise of the observed images was speckle dominated
which reduced the contrast level to 4x10^{-7} at 4.5Lambda/D. The optical setup
was built on the University of Illinois Seeing Improvement System (UnISIS)
optics table which is at the Coude focus of the 2.5-m telescope of the Mt.
Wilson Observatory. We used a 0.820 micron laser source coupled with a 5 micron
single-mode fiber to simulate an artificial star on the optical test bench of
UnISIS.",2005-04-05T18:43:11Z
"The Origin of the Spatial Distribution of X-ray luminous AGN in Massive
  Galaxy Clusters","We study the spatial distribution of a 95% complete sample of 508 X-ray point
sources (XPS) detected in the 0.5-2.0 keV band in Chandra ACIS-I observations
of 51 massive galaxy clusters found in the MACS survey. Covering the redshift
range z=0.3-0.7, our cluster sample is statistically complete and comprises all
MACS clusters with X-ray luminosities in excess of 4.5 x 10^44 erg/s (0.1-2.4
keV, h_0=0.7, LCDM). Also studied are 20 control fields that do not contain
clusters. We find the XPS surface density, computed in the cluster restframe,
to exhibit a pronounced excess within 3.5 Mpc of the cluster centers. The
excess, believed to be caused by AGN in the cluster, is significant at the 8.0
sigma confidence level compared to the XPS density observed at the field edges.
No significant central excess is found in the control fields. To investigate
the physical origin of the AGN excess, we study the radial AGN density profile
for a subset of 24 virialized clusters. We find a pronounced central spike
(r<0.5 Mpc), followed by a depletion region at about 1.5 Mpc, and a broad
secondary excess centered at approximately the virial radius of the host
clusters (~2.5 Mpc). We present evidence that the central AGN excess reflects
increased nuclear activity triggered by close encounters between infalling
galaxies and the giant cD-type elliptical occupying the very cluster center. By
contrast, the secondary excess at the cluster-field interface is likely due to
black holes being fueled by galaxy mergers. In-depth spectroscopic and
photometric follow-up observations of the optical counterparts of the XPS in a
subset of our sample are being conducted to confirm this picture.",2005-03-09T00:16:24Z
Extreme X-ray Behavior of the Low-Luminosity Active Nucleus in NGC 4395,"We present the results of a 17 ks Chandra ACIS-S observation of the nearby
dwarf spiral galaxy NGC 4395. Chandra affords the first high-quality, broadband
X-ray detection of the active nucleus of this object that is uncontaminated by
nearby sources in the field. We find the nuclear X-ray source to be unresolved
and confirm the rapid, large-amplitude variability reported in previous
studies. The light curve appears to show ~ 11 cycles of a quasi-periodic
oscillation with a period of ~ 400 s. If associated with an orbital feature
near the innermost stable orbit of the accretion disk, this period would
constrain the black-hole mass to be M < 9e5 M_sun. The X-ray spectrum indicates
absorption by an ionized medium, and the spectral shape appears to vary over
the course of our observation. Contrary to prior reports, however, the spectral
variations are uncorrelated with changes in the hard X-ray flux. It is possible
that the short-term spectral variability we observe results from column density
fluctuations in the ionized absorber. A power-law fit to the spectrum above 1
keV yields a photon index of Gamma ~ 0.6, much flatter than that typically
observed in the spectra of Seyfert 1 galaxies. We have ruled out photon pile-up
as the cause of the flat spectrum. Even when complex spectral features are
considered, the photon index is constrained to be Gamma < 1.25 (90%
confidence). Comparing our results with previous determinations of the photon
index (Gamma = 1.46 and 1.72), we conclude that the slope of the primary
continuum varies significantly on time scales of a year or less. The extreme
flatness and dramatic long-term variability of the X-ray spectrum are
unprecedented among active galactic nuclei.",2005-02-04T19:52:27Z
Dark matter detection in gamma astroparticle experiments,"The content of matter in the Universe is estimated to be the 27% of its
critical density. It is almost universally accepted that most ot this matter is
non-baryonic. Constraints from primordial nucleosynthesis and cosmic background
radiation measurements impose that the baryonic content of the Universe cannot
exceed the 4% of the critical density, so the nature of the remaining 23% has
yet to be identi ed. In this sense, one of the most promising candidates is
represented by supersymmetric neutralinos. If they exist, they give rise to
relic densities in the required range, and are very well motivated in the
framework of theoretical extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics.
In addition to direct neutralino searches and collider experiments, neutralino
annihilation into gamma rays, neutrinos and synchrotron emission from the
charged products represents a reliable way of detecting these intriguing
particles. The strongest signals are expected to come from the Galactic Center
and from the nearest dwarf spheroidals. Clumps of dark matter in galactic
haloes are well predicted by high resolution cold dark matter numerical
simulations. In this work we present our studies on the gamma-ray emission from
the Galactic Center and from the Draco dwarf spheroidal. We investigate the e
ect of clumpiness on the detection of signals from neutalinos for di erent mass
density pro les. One of the scienti c goals of the MAGIC telescope are just
searches for the stable lightest supersymmetric particle in the di erent
physical scenarios in which they are produed. Assuming MAGIC speci cations, we
draw some conclusions about the potentialities of this telescope in such a kind
of investigation.",2005-03-24T14:16:07Z
"Luminosity-Dependent Quasar Lifetimes: A New Interpretation of the
  Quasar Luminosity Function","We propose a new interpretation of the quasar luminosity function (LF),
derived from physically motivated models of quasar lifetimes and light curves.
In our picture, quasars evolve rapidly and their lifetime depends on both their
instantaneous and peak luminosities. We study this model using simulations of
galaxy mergers that successfully reproduce a wide range of observed quasar
phenomena. With lifetimes inferred from the simulations, we deconvolve the
observed quasar LF from the distribution of peak luminosities, and show that
they differ qualitatively, unlike for the simple models of quasar lifetimes
used previously. We find that the bright end of the LF traces the intrinsic
peak quasar activity, but that the faint end consists of quasars which are
either undergoing exponential growth to much larger masses and higher
luminosities, or are in sub-Eddington quiescent states going into or coming out
of a period of peak activity. The 'break' in the LF corresponds directly to the
maximum in the intrinsic distribution of peak luminosities, which falls off at
both brighter and fainter luminosities. Our interpretation of the quasar LF
provides a physical basis for the nature and slope of the faint-end
distribution, as well as the location of the break luminosity.",2005-04-11T20:02:05Z
Pieces of the puzzle: Ancient substructure in the Galactic disk,"We search for signatures of past accretion events in the Milky Way in the
recently published catalogue by Nordstrom et al.(2004), containing accurate
spatial and kinematic information as well as metallicities for 13240 nearby
stars. To optimize our strategy, we use numerical simulations to characterize
the properties of the debris from disrupted satellites. We find that stars with
a common progenitor should show distinct correlations between their orbital
parameters; in particular, between the apocentre A and pericentre P, as well as
their z-angular momentum (L_z). In the APL-space, such stars are expected to
cluster around regions of roughly constant eccentricity.
  The APL space for the Nordstrom catalogue exhibits a wealth of substructure,
much of which can be linked to dynamical perturbations induced by spiral arms
and the Galactic bar. However, our analysis also reveals a statistically
significant excess of stars on orbits of common (moderate) eccentricity,
analogous to the pattern expected for merger debris. Besides being dynamically
peculiar, the 274 stars in these substructures have very distinct metallicity
and age distributions, providing further evidence of their extra-Galactic
provenance. It is possible to identify among these stars, three coherent Groups
with characteristic ages and metallicities, that, in all likelihood, correspond
to the remains of disrupted satellites. [abridged]",2005-05-19T10:17:49Z

A new population of very high energy gamma-ray sources in the Milky Way,"Very high energy gamma-rays probe the long-standing mystery of the origin of
cosmic rays. Produced in the interactions of accelerated particles in
astrophysical objects, they can be used to image cosmic particle accelerators.
A first sensitive survey of the inner part of the Milky Way with the High
Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) reveals a population of eight previously
unknown firmly detected sources of very high energy gamma-rays. At least two
have no known radio or X-ray counterpart and may be representative of a new
class of `dark' nucleonic cosmic ray sources.",2005-04-18T09:50:43Z
Probing the curvature and dark energy,"Two new one-parameter tracking behavior dark energy representations
$\omega=\omega_0/(1+z)$ and $\omega=\omega_0 e^{z/(1+z)}/(1+z)$ are used to
probe the geometry of the Universe and the property of dark energy. The
combined type Ia supernova (SN Ia), Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data indicate that the Universe is
almost spatially flat and that dark energy contributes about 72% of the matter
content of the present universe. The observational data also tell us that
$\omega(0)\sim -1$. It is argued that the current observational data can hardly
distinguish different dark energy models to the zeroth order. The transition
redshift when the expansion of the Universe changed from deceleration phase to
acceleration phase is around $z_{\rm T}\sim 0.6$ by using our one-parameter
dark energy models.",2005-02-14T12:35:45Z
Cosmology with decaying tachyon matter,"We investigate the case of a homogeneous tachyon field coupled to gravity in
a spatially flat Friedman-Robertson-Walker spacetime. Assuming the field
evolution to be exponentially decaying with time we solve the field equations
and show that, under certain conditions, the scale factor represents an
accelerating universe, following a phase of decelerated expansion. We make use
of a model of dark energy (with p=-\rho) and dark matter (p=0) where a single
scalar field (tachyon) governs the dynamics of both the dark components. We
show that this model fits the current supernova data as well as the canonical
\LambdaCDM model. We give the bounds on the parameters allowed by the current
data.",2005-05-25T13:41:05Z
"Black hole-neutron star binaries in general relativity: effects of
  neutron star spin","We present new sequences of general relativistic, quasiequilibrium black
hole-neutron star binaries. We solve for the gravitational field in the
conformal thin-sandwich decomposition of Einstein's field equations, coupled to
the equations of relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium for a perfect fluid. We
account for the black hole by solving these equations in the background metric
of a Schwarzschild black hole whose mass is much larger than that of the
neutron star. The background metric is treated in Kerr-Schild as well as
isotropic coordinates. For the neutron star, we assume a polytropic equation of
state with adiabatic index Gamma=2, and solve for both irrotational and
corotational configurations. By comparing the results of irrotational and
synchronized configurations with the same background metric, we conclude that
the effect of the rotation on the location of tidal break-up is only on the
order of a few percent. The different choices in the background also lead to
differences of order a few percent, which may be an indication of the level to
which these configurations approximate quasiequilibrium.",2005-05-20T20:00:12Z
"Near-Infrared Observations of RR Lyrae variables in Galactic Globular
  Clusters: I. The case of M92","We present near-infrared J,H, and K-band time series observations of the
Galactic Globular Cluster (GGC) M92. On the basis of these data, we derived
well-sampled light curves for eleven out of the seventeen cluster RR Lyrae
variables, and in turn, accurate mean near-infrared (NIR) magnitudes. The
comparison between predicted and empirical slopes of NIR Period-Luminosity (PL)
relations indicates a very good agreement. Cluster distance determinations
based on independent theoretical NIR $PL$ relations present uncertainties
smaller than 5% and agree quite well with recent distance estimates based on
different distance indicators. We also obtained accurate and deep NIR
color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) ranging from the tip of the Red Giant Branch
(RGB) down to the Main Sequence Turn-Off. We detected the RGB bump and the NIR
luminosities of this evolutionary feature are, within theoretical and empirical
uncertainties, in good agreement with each other.",2005-03-07T12:22:25Z
Testing GR with the Double Pulsar: Recent Results,"This first ever double pulsar system consists of two pulsars orbiting the
common center of mass in a slightly eccentric orbit of only 2.4-hr duration.
The pair of pulsars with pulse periods of 22 ms and 2.8 sec, respectively,
confirms the long-proposed recycling theory for millisecond pulsars and
provides an exciting opportunity to study the works of pulsar magnetospheres by
a very fortunate geometrical alignment of the orbit relative to our
line-of-sight. In particular, this binary system represents a truly unique
laboratory for relativistic gravitational physics. This contribution serves as
an update on the currently obtained results and their consequences for the test
of general relativity in the strong-field regime. A complete and more
up-to-date report of the timing results will be presented elsewhere shortly.",2005-03-17T12:47:28Z
Cosmology in the Very Local Universe - Why Flow Models Matter,"While much of the focus of observational cosmology is on the high redshift
universe it is important not to neglect the very local universe as a source of
cosmological information. The inner profiles and number counts of low mass
halos have provided the biggest stumbling blocks so far for LCDM. These small
structures can only be seen nearby where the component of a galaxy's redshift
which is due to motions under gravity can be comparable to (or even larger
than) its cosmological redshift. We report on a new sample of Tully-Fisher
distances (the SFI++) which is being used in combination with publicly
available primary distances to model galaxy flows in and around the Local
Supercluster. This sample has ~10 times as many tracers as were used for the
current best model. Initially a parametric model including infall onto multiple
attractors will be used. Such models are not realistic representations of the
true velocity field, but provide useful first order corrections. We explore the
typical errors in distances from such a flow model and how they vary in
different regions of the local supercluster by fitting the same parametric
model to mock catalogs derived from a constrained simulation of the volume.",2005-03-11T19:16:37Z
On the local birth place of Geminga,"Using estimates of the distance and proper motion of Geminga and the
constraints on its radial velocity posed by the shape of its bow shock, we
investigate its birth place by tracing its space motion backwards in time. Our
results exclude the lambda Ori association as the origin site because of the
large distance between both objects at any time. Our simulations place the
birth region at approximately 90-240 pc from the Sun, between 197 degrees and
199 degrees in Galactic longitude and -16 degrees and -8 degrees in latitude,
most probably inside the Cas-Tau OB association or the Ori OB1a association. We
discard the possibility of the progenitor being a massive field star. The
association of Geminga with either stellar association implies an upper limit
of M = 15 Msun for the mass of its progenitor. We also propose new members for
the Cas-Tau and Ori OB1 associations.",2005-02-09T15:23:24Z
"Towards an understanding of the rapid decline of the cosmic star
  formation rate","We present a first analysis of deep 24 micron observations with the Spitzer
Space Telescope of a sample of nearly 1500 galaxies in a thin redshift slice,
0.65<z<0.75. We combine the infrared data with redshifts, rest-frame
luminosities, and colors from COMBO-17, and with morphologies from Hubble Space
Telescope images collected by the GEMS and GOODS projects. To characterize the
decline in star-formation rate (SFR) since z~0.7, we estimate the total thermal
infrared (IR) luminosities, SFRs, and stellar masses for the galaxies in this
sample. At z~0.7, nearly 40% of intermediate and high-mass galaxies (with
stellar masses >2x10^10 solar masses) are undergoing a period of intense star
formation above their past-averaged SFR. In contrast, less than 1% of
equally-massive galaxies in the local universe have similarly intense star
formation activity. Morphologically-undisturbed galaxies dominate the total
infrared luminosity density and SFR density: at z~0.7, more than half of the
intensely star-forming galaxies have spiral morphologies, whereas less than
\~30% are strongly interacting. Thus, a decline in major-merger rate is not the
underlying cause of the rapid decline in cosmic SFR since z~0.7. Physical
properties that do not strongly affect galaxy morphology - for example, gas
consumption and weak interactions with small satellite galaxies - appear to be
responsible.",2005-02-11T23:14:09Z
Quark stars and quantum-magnetically induced collapse,"Quark matter is expected to exist in the interior of compact stellar objects
as neutron stars or even the more exotic strange stars, based on the
Bodmer-Witten conjecture. Bare strange quark stars and (normal) strange
quark-matter stars, those possessing a baryon (electron-supported) crust, are
hypothesized as good candidates to explain the properties of a set of peculiar
stellar sources as the enigmatic X-ray source RX J1856.5-3754, some pulsars as
PSR B1828-11 and PSR B1642-03, and the anomalous X-ray pulsars and soft
gamma-ray repeaters. In the MIT bag model, quarks are treated as a degenerate
Fermi gas confined to a region of space having a vacuum energy density
$B_{bag}$ (the Bag constant). In this note, we modif{}y the MIT Bag Model by
including the electromagnetic interaction. We also show that this version of
the MIT model implies the anisotropy of the Bag pressure due to the presence of
the magnetic field. The equations of state of degenerate quarks gases are
studied in the presence of ultra strong magnetic fields. The behavior of a
system made-up of quarks having (or not) anomalous magnetic moment is reviewed.
A structural instability is found, which is related to the anisotropic nature
of the pressures in this highly magnetized matter. The conditions for the
collapse of this system are obtained and compared to a previous model of
neutron stars build-up on a neutron gas having anomalous magnetic moment.",2005-06-11T17:45:07Z
The Dwarf Nova PQ Andromedae,"We report a photometric study of the WZ Sagittae-type dwarf nova PQ
Andromedae. The light curve shows strong (0.05 mag full amplitude) signals with
periods of 1263(1) and 634(1) s, and a likely double-humped signal with
P=80.6(2) min. We interpret the first two as nonradial pulsation periods of the
underlying white dwarf, and the last as the orbital period of the underlying
binary. We estimate a distance of 150(50) pc from proper motions and the two
standard candles available: the white dwarf and the dwarf-nova outburst. At
this distance, the K magnitude implies that the secondary is probably fainter
than any star on the main sequence -- indicating a mass below the Kumar limit
at 0.075 M_sol. PQ And may be another ""period bouncer"", where evolution now
drives the binary out to longer period.",2005-06-07T08:37:47Z
"Color Gradients in Early-type Galaxies: Dependence on Environment and
  Redshift","Color gradients in early-type galaxies contain valuable clues about their
formation and evolutionary histories and mechanisms. We examine color gradients
in 1,700 early-type galaxies in 159 galaxy clusters spanning a redshift range
of 0.05 to 0.2. We find that color gradients strongly depend on the environment
where galaxies reside, with steeper color gradients in poor rather than rich
clusters. No dependence of color gradients on galaxy luminosity is found in
either rich or poor clusters. The difference in color gradients can be
explained by a change in the internal metallicity and/or an age gradient in
these galaxies. Our results support a reasonable picture whereby young
early-type galaxies form in a dissipative collapse process, and then undergo
increased (either major or minor) merging activity in richer rather than in
poor clusters.",2005-04-28T09:27:20Z
"Angular diameter measurements of evolved variables by lunar occultations

three semiregular (SR) and irregular variables (SW Vir, eta Gem and mu Gem) and
a supergiant SR variable (TV Gem) by lunar occultation observations in the
near-IR broad K-band (2.2 micron). Lunar occultations of eta Gem and mu Gem
were also observed for the first time simultaneously in both the K and L'
bands, yielding angular diameters at 2.2 and 3.8 micron. Effective temperatures
and linear radii are also derived for all the observed sources and compared
with earlier measurements. The mode of pulsation of both Mira and SR sources in
our sample is discussed.",2005-04-14T13:41:08Z
Supernova neutrino challenges,"A principal `supernova neutrino challenge' is the computational difficulty of
six-dimensional neutrino radiation hydrodynamics. The variety of resulting
approximations has provoked a long history of uncertainty in the core-collapse
supernova explosion mechanism, but recent work highlighting low-mode convection
and a newly-recognized instability in spherical accretion shocks may signal
(yet another) resolution. As part of its goal of elucidating the explosion
mechanism, the Terascale Supernova Initiative is committed to meeting the full
complexity of the computational challenge. The understanding of supernova
neutrino emission gained in detailed simulations provides a potential basis for
learning about two major remaining unknowns in neutrino flavor mixing: the
value of the mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, and distinguishing between ``normal''
and ``inverted'' mass hierarchies.",2005-02-11T01:43:10Z
"Early-time Spitzer observations of the type II-Plateau supernova, 2004dj","We present mid-infrared observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope of the
nearby type II-P supernova, SN 2004dj, at epochs of 89 to 129 days. We have
obtained the first mid-IR spectra of any supernova apart from SN 1987A. A
prominent [NiII] 6.64 micron line is observed, from which we deduce that the
mass of stable nickel must be at least 2.2e10(-4) Msun. We also observe the red
wing of the CO-fundamental band. We relate our findings to possible progenitors
and favour an evolved star, most likely a red supergiant, with a probable
initial mass between ~10 and 15 Msun.",2005-06-17T10:31:08Z
The mass of the black hole in 3C 273,"In this paper we apply the reverberation method to determine the mass of the
black hole in 3C273 from the Ly a and C iv emission lines using archival IUE
observations. Following the standard assumptions of the method, we find a
maximum-likelihood estimate of the mass of 6.59 10^9 Mo, with a 1 sigma
confidence interval 5.69-8.27 10^9 Mo. This estimate is more than one order of
magnitude larger than that obtained in a previous study using Balmer lines. We
reanalyze the optical data and show that the method applied to the Ha, Hb, and
Hg Balmer lines produce mass estimates lower by a factor 2.5, but already much
larger than the previous estimate derived from the same lines. The finding of
such a high mass in a face-on object is a strong indication that the gas motion
is not confined to the accretion disk. The new mass estimate makes 3C273
accreting with an accretion rate about six times lower than the Eddington rate.
We discuss the implications of our result for the broad-line-region size and
black-hole mass vs luminosity relationships for the set of objects for which
reverberation black-hole masses have been obtained. We find that, while objects
with super-Eddington luminosities might theoretically be possible, their
existence is not necessarily implied by this sample.",2005-02-15T15:14:44Z
"A New Radio Catalog of Compact HII Regions in the Milky Way II. The 1.4

second Galactic quadrants (340 deg <l< 120 deg, |b|<0.8 deg with |b|< 1.8 deg
for 350 deg <l< 40 deg and |b|<2.5 deg for 100 deg <l<105 deg) in conjunction
with the MSX6C Galactic plane mid-infrared catalog to supplement and better
understand our 5 GHz catalog (Giveon et al. 2005). A radio catalog of this
region was first published by Zoonematkermani et al. (1990), but we have
re-reduced the data with significantly improved calibration and mosaicing
procedures, resulting in more than a tripling of the number of 1.4 GHz sources
detected. Comparison of the new 1.4 GHz catalog and the MSX6C catalog resulted
in a sample of 556 matches, out of which we estimate only 11 to be chance
coincidences. Most of the matches show red MSX colors. The scale height of
their Galactic latitude distribution is 24'-28' (FWHM) or ~60-70 pc (for a
distance of 8.5 kpc), depending on longitude. The latitude distribution
flattens out significantly above l~40 deg and the number of matches drops off
sharply.",2005-03-19T07:09:42Z
"Dynamical and Spectral Modeling of the Ionized Gas and Nuclear
  Environment in NGC 3783","We present a new approach for calculating the physical properties of highly
ionized X-ray flows in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Our method relies on a
detailed treatment of the structure, dynamics and spectrum of the gas. A
quantitative comparison of our model predictions with the 900 ksec Chandra/HETG
X-ray spectrum of NGC 3783 shows that: (1) The highly ionized outflow is driven
by thermal pressure gradients and radiation pressure force is less important.
(2) A full featured dynamical model that provides a very good fit to the high
resolution X-ray spectrum requires a multi-phased flow with a density power
spectrum reminiscent of the interstellar medium. (3) Adiabatic cooling is an
important factor and so is an additional heating source that may be related to
the apparent multi-phase and turbulent nature of the flow. (4) The base of the
flow is ~1pc from the central object, in agreement with some, but not all
previous estimates. (5) The mass loss rate is in the range 0.01-0.1 solar
masses per year which is smaller than previous estimates and of the same order
of the mass accretion rate in this object.",2005-02-14T20:03:19Z
"MIPS 70-micron Observations of the Spitzer Extragalactic First Look
  Survey","Early results from the 70-micron observations of the Spitzer Extragalactic
First Look Survey are presented. As a whole, about 90% of the population show
infrared colors that are consistent with the spectral energy distributions of
the local IRAS population of luminous infrared starbursts, while approximately
10% of the sample show warm infrared colors consistent with AGN activity. The
mean redshift for the population is z=0.2, and the mean total infrared
luminosity is about L(ir)= 2x10^{11} L(sun).",2005-02-28T20:19:06Z
A universal velocity distribution of relaxed collisionless structures,"Several general trends have been identified for equilibrated,
self-gravitating collisionless systems, such as density or anisotropy profiles.
These are integrated quantities which naturally depend on the underlying
velocity distribution function (VDF) of the system. We study this VDF through a
set of numerical simulations, which allow us to extract both the radial and the
tangential VDF. We find that the shape of the VDF is universal, in the sense
that it depends only on two things namely the dispersion (radial or tangential)
and the local slope of the density. Both the radial and the tangential VDF's
are universal for a collection of simulations, including controlled collisions
with very different initial conditions, radial infall simulation, and
structures formed in cosmological simulations.",2005-05-19T20:00:11Z
"The Cluster of Galaxies Surrounding Cygnus A II: New Velocities and a
  Dynamical Model","We have spectroscopically identified 77 new members of the Cygnus A cluster,
bringing the total to 118 galaxies consistent with cluster membership. We use
these data combined with the results from X-rays to deduce a dynamical model
for the system. The data are consistent with a cluster-cluster merger viewed at
a projection angle of 30-45 degrees, 0.2-0.6 Gyr prior to core passage. We
estimate the richness of the combined cluster system at Abell richness class 2
or greater, suggesting the merger of two richness class 1 clusters.",2005-03-27T17:41:08Z
"Gravitational Radiation from Coalescing Supermassive Black Hole Binaries
  in a Hierarchical Galaxy Formation Model","We investigate the expected gravitational wave emission from coalescing
supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries resulting from mergers of their host
galaxies. We employ a semi-analytic model of galaxy and quasar formation based
on the hierarchical clustering scenario to estimate the amplitude of the
expected stochastic gravitational wave background owing to inspiraling SMBH
binaries and bursts rates owing to the SMBH binary coalescence events. We find
that the characteristic strain amplitude of the background radiation is $h_c(f)
\sim 10^{-16} (f/1 \mu {\rm Hz})^{-2/3}$ for $f \lesssim 1 \mu {\rm Hz}$. The
main contribution to the total strain amplitude of the background radiation
comes from SMBH coalescence events at $0<z<1$. We also find that a future
space-based gravitational wave interferometer such as the planned \textit{Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna} ({\sl LISA}) might detect intense gravitational
wave bursts associated with coalescence of SMBH binaries with total mass
$M_{\rm tot} < 10^7 M_{\odot}$ at $z \gtrsim 2$ at a rate $ \sim 1.0 {\rm
yr}^{-1}$. Our model predicts that burst signals with a larger amplitude
$h_{\rm burst} \sim 10^{-15}$ correspond to coalescence events of massive SMBH
binary with total mass $M_{\rm tot} \sim 10^8 M_{\odot}$ at low redshift $ z
\lesssim 1$ at a rate $ \sim 0.1 {\rm yr}^{-1}$ whereas those with a smaller
amplitude $h_{\rm burst} \sim 10^{-17}$ correspond to coalescence events of
less massive SMBH binary with total mass $M_{\rm tot} \sim 10^6 M_{\odot}$ at
high redshift $ z \gtrsim 3$.",2005-02-25T06:34:29Z
High energy gamma-ray emission from the starburst nucleus of NGC 253,"The high density medium that characterizes the central regions of starburst
galaxies and its power to accelerate particles up to relativistic energies make
these objects good candidates as $\gamma$-rays sources. In this paper, a
self-consistent model of the multifrequency emission of the starburst galaxy
NGC 253, from radio to gamma-rays, is presented. The model is in agreement with
all current measurements and provides predictions for the high energy behavior
of the NGC 253 central region. Prospects for observations with the HESS array
and GLAST satellite are especially discussed.",2005-06-10T14:50:20Z
"Characteristic QSO Accretion Disk Temperatures from Spectroscopic
  Continuum Variability","Using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar spectra taken at multiple
epochs, we find that the composite flux density differences in the rest frame
wavelength range 1300-6000 AA can be fit by a standard thermal accretion disk
model where the accretion rate has changed from one epoch to the next (without
considering additional continuum emission components). The fit to the composite
residual has two free parameters: a normalizing constant and the average
characteristic temperature $\bar{T}^*$. In turn the characteristic temperature
is dependent on the ratio of the mass accretion rate to the square of the black
hole mass. We therefore conclude that most of the UV/optical variability may be
due to processes involving the disk, and thus that a significant fraction of
the UV/optical spectrum may come directly from the disk.",2005-06-01T04:22:41Z
Revised dynamics or dark matter in galactic and extra galactic scales?,"Allowing the energy of a gravitational field to serve partially as its own
source allows gravitating bodies to exhibit stronger fields, as if they were
more massive. Depending on degree of compaction of the body, the field could be
one to five times larger than the newtonian field. This is a comfortable range
of increase in field strength and may prove to be of convenience in the study
of velocity curves of spirals, of velocity dispersions in clusters of galaxies
and in interpreting the Tully-Fisher or Faber-Jackson relations in galaxies or
systems of galaxies. The revised gravitation admits of superposition principle
but only approximately in systems whose components are widely separated. The
revised dynamics admits of the equivalence principle in that, the effective
force acting on a test particle is derived from a potential, and could be
eliminated in a freely falling frame of reference",2005-05-18T11:12:45Z
"The photometric evolution of FU Orionis objects: disc instability and
  wind-envelope interaction","We present the results of a photometric monitoring campaign of three well
studied FU Orionis systems (FU Orionis, V1057 Cygni and V1515 Cygni) undertaken
at Maidanak Observatory between 1981 and 2003. When combined with photometric
data in the literature, this database provides a valuable resource for
searching for short timescale variability - both periodic and aperiodic - as
well as for studying the secular evolution of these systems. In the case of
V1057 Cyg (which is the system exhibiting the largest changes in brightness
since it went into outburst) we compare the photometric data with time
dependent models. We show that prior to the end of the `plateau' stage in 1996,
the evolution of V1057 Cyg in the $V-(B-V)$ colour-magnitude diagram is well
represented by disc instability models in which the outburst is triggered by
some agent - such as an orbiting planet - in the inner disc. Following the end
of the plateau phase in 1996, the dimming and irregular variations are
consistent with occultation of the source by a variable dust screen, which has
previously been interpreted in terms of dust condensation events in the
observed disc wind. Here we instead suggest that this effect results from the
interaction between the wind and an infalling dusty envelope, the existence of
this envelope having been previously invoked in order to explain the mid
infrared emissio of FU Orionis systems. We discuss how this model may explain
some of the photometric and spectroscopic characteristics of FU Orionis systems
in general.",2005-05-25T16:23:51Z
Low-energy quantum gravity leads to another picture of the universe,"If gravitons are super-strong interacting particles and the low-temperature
graviton background exists, the basic cosmological conjecture about the
Dopplerian nature of redshifts may be false: a full magnitude of cosmological
redshift would be caused by interactions of photons with gravitons.
Non-forehead collisions with gravitons will lead to a very specific additional
relaxation of any photonic flux that gives a possibility of another
interpretation of supernovae 1a data - without any kinematics. These facts may
implicate a necessity to change the standard cosmological paradigm. Some
features of a new paradigm are discussed. In a frame of this model, every
observer has two different cosmological horizons. One of them is defined by
maximum existing temperatures of remote sources - by big enough distances, all
of them will be masked with the CMB radiation. Another, and much smaller, one
depends on their maximum luminosity - the luminosity distance increases with a
redshift much quickly than the geometrical one.
  If the considered quantum mechanism of classical gravity is realized in the
nature, then an existence of black holes contradicts to the equivalence
principle. In this approach, the two fundamental constants - Hubble's and
Newton's ones - should be connected between themselves. The theoretical value
of the Hubble constant is computed. Also, every massive body would be
decelerated due to collisions with gravitons that may be connected with the
Pioneer 10 anomaly.",2005-05-14T19:34:27Z
511 KeV photons from superconducting cosmic strings,"We show that a tangle of light superconducting strings in the Milky Way could
be the source of the observed 511 KeV emission from electron-positron
annihilation in the Galactic bulge. The scenario predicts a flux that is in
agreement with observations if the strings are at the ~ 1 TeV scale making the
particle physics within reach of planned accelerator experiments. The emission
is directly proportional to the galactic magnetic field and future observations
should be able to differentiate the superconducting string scenario from other
proposals.",2005-05-03T20:00:34Z
Swift XRT and VLT Observations of the Afterglow of GRB 041223,"The Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Explorer, launched on 2004 November 20, is a
multiwavelength, autonomous, rapid-slewing observatory for gamma-ray burst
(GRB) astronomy. On 2004 December 23, during the activation phase of the
mission, the Swift X-Ray Telescope (XRT) was pointed at a burst discovered
earlier that day by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope. A fading, uncataloged
X-ray source was discovered by the XRT and was observed over a period of about
3 hours, beginning 4.6 hours after the burst. The X-ray detection triggered a
VLT observation of the optical/NIR counterpart, located about 1.1 arcseconds
from the XRT position. The X-ray counterpart faded rapidly, with a power law
index of -1.72 +/- 0.20. The average unabsorbed X-ray flux 4.6-7.9 hours after
the burst was 6.5 x 10^{-12} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} in the 0.5-10 keV band, for a
power-law spectrum of photon index 2.02 +/- 0.13 with Galactic absorption. The
NIR counterpart was observed at three epochs between 16 and 87 hours after the
burst, and faded with a power-law index of -1.14 +/- 0.08 with a
reddening-corrected SED power-law slope of -0.40 +/- 0.03. We find that the
X-ray and NIR data are consistent with a two-component jet in a wind medium,
with an early jet break in the narrow component and an underlying electron
index of 1.8-2.0.",2005-02-16T19:44:11Z
The Heated Core of the Radio-Quiet Galaxy Cluster A644,"We present an analysis of a Chandra ACIS-I observation of the massive galaxy
cluster A644. This cluster was previously classified as a cooling flow, but no
radio emission has been detected from its cD galaxy. Outside the core (R ~75
kpc ~0.03R_vir) the hot ICM has properties consistent with a (relaxed)
cool-core cluster out to the largest radii investigated (R ~415 kpc ~0.14
R_vir). Over this region the gravitating mass profile is described well by a
Navarro-Frenk-White profile with concentration parameter, c = 6.1 +/- 1.2, and
virial radius, R_vir = 2.9 +/- 0.4 Mpc. However, inside the core the
temperature and entropy profiles reverse their inward radial decline and rise
at the center; the inner temperature profile is inconsistent with a constant at
the 2.3 sigma level. Although the core region does not display X-ray cavities
or filamentary structures characteristic of radio-loud, cool-core clusters, the
peak of the X-ray emission is offset from that of the centroid of the global
X-ray halo by ~60 kpc. The position of the cD galaxy lies approximately between
the X-ray peak and centroid, further testifying to a merger origin for the
properties of the X-ray emission in the core. We discuss the implications of
A644 and the small number of radio-quiet, cool-core clusters for the AGN
feedback paradigm to suppress cooling flows in clusters.",2005-05-19T18:20:25Z
Pioneer anomaly? Gravitational pull due to the Kuiper belt,"In this work we study the gravitational influence of the material extending
from Uranus orbit to the Kuiper belt and beyond on objects moving within these
regions. We conclude that a density distribution given by $\rho(r)=\frac{1}{r}$
(for $r\geq 20 UA$) generates a constant acceleration towards the Sun on those
objects, which, with the proper amount of mass, accounts for the blue shift
detected on the Pioneers space crafts. We also discuss the effect of this
gravitational pull on Neptune, and comment on the possible origin of such a
matter distribution.",2005-03-16T19:54:33Z
"Universal lateral distribution of energy deposit in air showers and its
  application to shower reconstruction","The light intensity distribution in a shower image and its implications to
the primary energy reconstructed by the fluorescence technique are studied.
Based on detailed CORSIKA energy deposit simulations, a universal analytical
formula is derived for the lateral distribution of light in the shower image
and a correction factor is obtained to account for the fraction of shower light
falling into outlying pixels in the detector. The expected light profiles and
the corresponding correction of the primary shower energy are illustrated for
several typical event geometries. This correction of the shower energy can
exceed 10%, depending on shower geometry.",2005-05-18T11:29:40Z
GMRT HI observations of the Eridanus group of galaxies,"The GMRT HI 21cm-line observations of galaxies in the Eridanus group are
presented. The Eridanus group, at a distance of ~23 Mpc, is a loose group of
\~200 galaxies. The group extends more than 10 Mpc in projection. The velocity
dispersion of the galaxies in the group is ~240 km/s. The galaxies are
clustered into different sub-groups. The overall population mix of the group is
30% (E+S0) and 70% (Sp+Irr). The observations of 57 Eridanus galaxies were
carried out with the GMRT for ~200 hour. HI emission was detected from 31
galaxies. The channel rms of ~1.0 mJy beam^{-1} was achieved for most of the
image-cubes made with 4 hour of data. The corresponding HI column density
sensitivity (3-sigma) is ~1x10^{20} cm^{-2} for a velocity-width of ~13.4 km/s.
The 3-sigma detection limit of HI mass is ~1.2x10^{7} M_sun for a line-width of
50 km/s. Total HI images, HI velocity fields, global HI line profiles, HI mass
surface densities, HI disk parameters and HI rotation curves are presented. The
velocity fields are analysed separately for the approaching and the receding
sides of the galaxies. This data will be used to study the HI and the radio
continuum properties, the Tully-Fisher relations, the dark matter halos, and
the kinematical and HI lopsidedness in galaxies.",2005-03-24T14:20:39Z
Information content of the non-linear matter power spectrum,"We use an ensemble of N-body simulations of the currently favoured
(concordance) cosmological model to measure the amount of information contained
in the non-linear matter power spectrum about the amplitude of the initial
power spectrum. Two surprising results emerge from this study: (i) that there
is very little independent information in the power spectrum in the translinear
regime (k ~ 0.2-0.8 Mpc/h at the present day) over and above the information at
linear scales and (ii) that the cumulative information begins to rise sharply
again with increasing wavenumber in the non-linear regime. In the fully
non-linear regime, the simulations are consistent with no loss of information
during translinear and non-linear evolution. If this is indeed the case then
the results suggest a picture in which translinear collapse is very rapid, and
is followed by a bounce prior to virialization, impelling a wholesale revision
of the HKLM-PD formalism.",2005-02-03T22:48:14Z
Taxing the Rich: Recombinations and Bubble Growth During Reionization,"Reionization is inhomogeneous for two reasons: the clumpiness of the
intergalactic medium (IGM) and clustering of the discrete ionizing sources.
While numerical simulations can in principle take both into account, they are
at present limited by small box sizes. On the other hand, analytic models have
only examined the limiting cases of a clumpy IGM (with uniform ionizing
emissivity) and clustered sources (embedded in a uniform IGM). Here, we present
an analytic model for the evolving topology of reionization that includes both
factors. At first, recombinations can be ignored and ionized bubbles grow
primarily through major mergers. As a result, reionization resembles
""punctuated equilibrium,"" with a series of well-separated sharp jumps in the
ionizing background. These features are local effects and do not reflect
similar jumps in the global ionized fraction. We then combine our bubble model
with a simple description of recombinations in the IGM. We show that the
bubbles stop growing when recombinations balance ionizations. If the IGM
density structure is similar to that at moderate redshifts, this limits the
bubble radii to ~20 comoving Mpc; however, it may be much smaller if the IGM is
significantly clumpier at higher redshifts. Once a bubble reaches saturation,
that region of the universe has for all intents and purposes entered the
""post-overlap"" stage, so the overlap epoch actually has a finite width. This
picture naturally explains the substantial large-scale variation in
Lyman-series opacity along the lines of sight to the known z>6 quasars. More
quasar spectra will shed light on the transition between the ""bubble-dominated""
topology characteristic of reionization and the ""web-dominated"" topology
characteristic of the later universe. [Abridged]",2005-05-03T20:34:04Z
Supernovae: Explosions in the Cosmos,"In this article, a broad perspective of supernovae, their classification and

Black Holes in Galaxy Mergers: Evolution of Quasars,"Based on numerical simulations of gas-rich galaxy mergers, we discuss a model
in which quasar activity is tied to the self-regulated growth of supermassive
black holes in galaxies. Nuclear inflow of gas attending a galaxy collision
triggers a starburst and feeds black hole growth, but for most of the duration
of the starburst, the black hole is heavily obscured by surrounding gas and
dust which limits the visibility of the quasar, especially at optical and UV
wavelengths. Eventually, feedback energy from accretion heats the gas and
expels it in a powerful wind, leaving a 'dead quasar'. Between buried and dead
phases there is a window during which the galaxy would be seen as a luminous
quasar. Because the black hole mass, radiative output, and distribution of
obscuring gas and dust all evolve strongly with time, the duration of this
phase of observable quasar activity depends on both the waveband and imposed
luminosity threshold. We determine the observed and intrinsic lifetimes as a
function of luminosity and frequency, and calculate observable lifetimes ~10
Myr for bright quasars in the optical B-band, in good agreement with empirical
estimates and much smaller than the black hole growth timescales ~100 Myr,
naturally producing a substantial population of 'buried' quasars. However,
observed and intrinsic energy outputs converge in the IR and hard X-ray bands
as attenuation becomes weaker and chances of observation greatly increase. We
obtain the distribution of column densities along sightlines in which the
quasar is seen above a given luminosity, and find that our result agrees
remarkably well with observed estimates of the column density distribution from
the SDSS for appropriate luminosity thresholds. (Abridged)",2005-04-07T20:00:53Z
Thermal and non-thermal energies in solar flares,"The energy of the thermal flare plasma and the kinetic energy of the
non-thermal electrons in 14 hard X-ray peaks from 9 medium-sized solar flares
have been determined from RHESSI observations. The emissions have been
carefully separated in the spectrum. The turnover or cutoff in the low-energy
distribution of electrons has been studied by simulation and fitting, yielding
a reliable lower limit to the non-thermal energy. It remains the largest
contribution to the error budget. Other effects, such as albedo, non-uniform
target ionization, hot target, and cross-sections on the spectrum have been
studied. The errors of the thermal energy are about equally as large. They are
due to the estimate of the flare volume, the assumption of the filling factor,
and energy losses. Within a flare, the non-thermal/thermal ratio increases with
accumulation time, as expected from loss of thermal energy due to radiative
cooling or heat conduction. Our analysis suggests that the thermal and
non-thermal energies are of the same magnitude. This surprising result may be
interpreted by an efficient conversion of non-thermal energy to hot flare
plasma.",2005-03-03T15:00:34Z
Three-dimensional stability of the solar tachocline,"The three-dimensional, hydrodynamic stability of the solar tachocline is
investigated based on a rotation profile as a function of both latitude and
radius. By varying the amplitude of the latitudinal differential rotation, we
find linear stability limits at various Reynolds numbers by numerical
computations. We repeated the computations with different latitudinal and
radial dependences of the angular velocity. The stability limits are all higher
than those previously found from two-dimensional approximations and higher than
the shear expected in the Sun. It is concluded that any part of the tachocline
which is radiative is hydrodynamically stable against small perturbations.",2005-06-13T12:28:19Z
"X-ray Cluster Associated with the z=1.063 CSS Quasar 3C 186: The Jet is
  NOT Frustrated","We report the Chandra discovery of an X-ray cluster at redshift z = 1.063
associated with the Compact Steep Spectrum radio loud quasar 3C 186
(Q0740+380). Diffuse X-ray emission is detected out to ~120 kpc from the quasar
and contains 741+/-40 net counts. The X-ray spectrum of the extended emission
shows strong Fe-line emission (EW=412eV) at the quasar redshift and confirms
the thermal nature of this diffuse component. We measure a cluster temperature
of 5.2(+1.2/-0.9) keV and an X-ray luminosity L(0.5-2 keV) ~ 6e44 erg/sec,
which are in agreement with the luminosity-temperature relation for
high-redshift clusters. This is the first detection of a bright X-ray cluster
around a luminous (L_bol ~1e47 erg/sec) CSS quasar at high redshift and only
the fifth z>1 X-ray cluster detected. We find that the CSS radio source is
highly overpressured with respect to the thermal cluster medium by about 3
orders of magnitude. This provides direct observational evidence that the radio
source is not thermally confined as posited in the ``frustrated'' scenario for
CSS sources. Instead, it appears that the radio source may be young and we are
observing it at an early stage of its evolution. In that case the radio source
could supply the energy into the cluster and potentially prevent its cooling.",2005-06-16T19:08:44Z
"Can Fluffy Dust Alleviate the ""Subsolar"" Interstellar Abundance Problem?","What might be the most appropriate set of interstellar reference abundances
of chemical elements (both in gas and in dust) relative to hydrogen has been a
subject of much discussion in the past decade. While historically the Sun has
been taken as the reference standard, it has recently been suggested that the
interstellar abundances might be better represented by those of B stars
(because of their young ages) which are just ~60--70% of the widely adopted
solar values (``subsolar''). On the other hand, the most recent estimates of
the solar carbon and oxygen abundances are also close to those of B stars. If
the interstellar abundances are indeed ``subsolar'' like B stars or the
newly-determined solar C,O values, there might be a lack of raw material to
form the dust to account for the interstellar extinction. In literature it has
been argued that this problem could be solved if interstellar grains have a
fluffy, porous structure since fluffy grains are more effective in absorbing
and scattering optical and ultraviolet starlight than compact grains (on a per
unit mass basis). However, we show in this work that, using the Kramers-Kronig
relation, fluffy dust is not able to overcome the abundance shortage problem. A
likely solution is that the abundances of refractory elements in stellar
photospheres may under-represent the composition of the interstellar material
from which stars are formed, resulting either from the possible underestimation
of the degree of heavy-element settling in stellar atmospheres, or from the
incomplete incorporation of heavy elements in stars during the star formation
process.",2005-03-25T20:31:43Z
"Deep Photometry of GRB 041006 Afterglow: Hypernova Bump at Redshift
  z=0.716","We present deep optical photometry of the afterglow of gamma-ray burst (GRB)
041006 and its associated hypernova obtained over 65 days after detection (55
R-band epochs on 10 different nights). Our early data (t<4 days) joined with
published GCN data indicates a steepening decay, approaching F_nu ~t^{-0.6} at
early times (<<1 day) and F_nu ~t^{-1.3} at late times. The break at
t_b=0.16+-0.04 days is the earliest reported jet break among all GRB
afterglows. During our first night, we obtained 39 exposures spanning 2.15
hours from 0.62 to 0.71 days after the burst that reveal a smooth afterglow,
with an rms deviation of 0.024 mag from the local power-law fit, consistent
with photometric errors. After t~4 days, the decay slows considerably, and the
light curve remains approximately flat at R~24 mag for a month before decaying
by another magnitude to reach R~25 mag two months after the burst. This
``bump'' is well-fitted by a k-corrected light curve of SN1998bw, but only if
stretched by a factor of 1.38 in time. In comparison with the other GRB-related
SNe bumps, GRB 041006 stakes out new parameter space for GRB/SNe, with a very
bright and significantly stretched late-time SN light curve. Within a small
sample of fairly well observed GRB/SN bumps, we see a hint of a possible
correlation between their peak luminosity and their ``stretch factor'', broadly
similar to the well-studied Phillips relation for the type Ia supernovae.",2005-02-16T19:23:56Z
The Kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect from Reionization,"During the epoch of reionization, local variations in the ionized fraction
(patchiness) imprint arcminute-scale temperature anisotropies in the CMB
through the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. We employ an improved
version of an analytic model of reionization devised in Furlanetto et al.(2004)
to calculate the kSZ anisotropy from patchy reionization. This model uses
extended Press-Schechter theory to determine the distribution and evolution of
HII bubbles and produces qualitatively similar reionization histories to those
seen in recent numerical simulations. We find that the angular power spectrum
of the kSZ anisotropies depends strongly on the size distribution of the HII
bubbles and on the duration of reionization. In addition, we show that upcoming
measurements of the kSZ effect should be able to distinguish between several
popular reionization scenarios. In particular, the amplitude of the patchy
power spectrum for reionization scenarios in which the IGM is significantly
ionized by Population III stars (or by mini-quasars/decaying particles) can be
larger (or smaller) by over a factor of 3 than the amplitude in more
traditional reionization histories (with temperature anisotropies that range
between 0.5 and 3 micro-Kelvin at l = 5000). We highlight the differences in
the kSZ signal between many possible reionization morphologies and discuss the
constraints that future observations of the kSZ will place on this epoch.",2005-04-07T20:00:03Z
"Thermal and non-thermal nature of the soft excess emission from Sersic
  159-03 observed with XMM-Newton","Several nearby clusters exhibit an excess of soft X-ray radiation which
cannot be attributed to the hot virialized intra-cluster medium. There is no
consensus to date on the origin of the excess emission: it could be either of
thermal origin, or due to an inverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave
background. Using high resolution XMM-Newton data of Sersic 159-03 we first
show that strong soft excess emission is detected out to a radial distance of
0.9 Mpc. The data are interpreted using the two viable models available, i.e.,
by invoking a warm reservoir of thermal gas, or relativistic electrons which
are part of a cosmic ray population. The thermal interpretation of the excess
emission, slightly favored by the goodness-of-fit analysis, indicates that the
warm gas responsible for the emission is high in mass and low in metallicity.",2005-04-05T00:58:27Z

lower transition region of the star. These models are the most detailed
constructed to date for a main-sequence star other than the Sun. New ionisation
balance calculations, which account for the effect of finite density on
dielectronic recombination rates, are presented for carbon, nitrogen, oxygen
and silicon. The results of these calculations are significantly different from
the standard Arnaud & Rothenflug ion balance, particularly for alkali-like
ions. The new atmospheric models are used to place constraints on possible
First Ionisation Potential (FIP) related abundance variations in the lower
atmosphere and to discuss limitations of single-component models for the
interpretation of certain optically thick line fluxes.",2005-06-02T15:32:03Z
Deep ACS Imaging of the Halo of NGC 5128: Reaching the Horizontal Branch,"Using the HST Wide Field Camera of the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), we
have obtained deep (V,I) photometry of an outer-halo field in NGC 5128, to a
limiting magnitude of I~29. Our photometry directly reveals the core
helium-burning stellar population (the ``red clump'' or horizontal branch) in a
giant E/S0 galaxy for the first time.
  The color-magnitude diagram displays a very wide red giant branch (RGB), an
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) bump, and the red clump; no noticeable population
of blue HB stars is present, confirming previous suggestions that old, very
metal-poor population is not ubiquitous in the halo of this galaxy. From the
upper RGB we derive the metallicity distribution, which we find to be very
broad and moderately metal-rich, with average [M/H]=-0.64 and dispersion 0.49
dex. The MDF is virtually identical to that found in other halo fields observed
previously with the HST, but with an enhanced metal-rich population which was
partially missed in the previous surveys due to V-band incompleteness for these
very red stars. Combining the metallicity sensitive colors of the RGB stars
with the metallicity and age sensitive features of the AGB bump and the red
clump, we infer the average age of the halo stars to be 8^{+3}_{-3.5} Gy.
  As part of our study, we present an empirical calibration of the ACS F606W
and F814W filters to the standard V and I bands, achieved with ground-based
observations of the same field made from the EMMI camera of the New Technology
Telescope of the ESO La Silla Observatory.",2005-05-31T14:42:11Z
"Diffusion coefficient and acceleration spectrum from direct measurements
  of charged cosmic ray nuclei","We discuss the potentials of several experimental configurations dedicated to
direct measurements of charged cosmic ray (CR) nuclei at energies $\gsim$ 100
GeV/n. Within a two-zone propagation model for stable CRs, we calculate light
primary and secondary nuclei fluxes for different diffusion and acceleration
schemes. We show that the new detectors exploiting the long and ultra long
duration balloon flights could determine the diffusion coefficient power index
$\delta$ through the measurement of the boron-to-carbon ratio with an
uncertainty of about 10-15 %, if systematic errors are low enough. Only
space-based or satellite detectors will be able to determine $\delta$ with very
high accuracy even in the case of important systematic errors, thanks to the
higher energy reach and the less severe limitations in the exposure. We show
that no uncertainties other than those on $\delta$ affect the determination of
the acceleration slope $\alpha$, so that measures of light primary nuclei, such
as the carbon one, performed with the same experiments, will provide valuable
information on the acceleration mechanisms.",2005-04-06T12:48:15Z
X-ray emission from early-type stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster,"The X-ray properties of twenty ~1 Myr old O, B, and A stars of the Orion
Trapezium are examined with data from the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project
(COUP). On the basis of simple theories for X-ray emission, we define two
classes separated at spectral type B4: hotter stars have strong winds that may
give rise to X-ray emission in small- or large-scale wind shocks, and cooler
stars that should be X-ray dark due to their weaker winds and absence of outer
convection zones where dynamos can generate magnetic fields.
  Only two of the massive stars show exclusively the constant soft-spectrum
emission expected from the standard model for X-ray emission from hot stars
involving many small shocks in an unmagnetized radiatively accelerated wind.
Most of the other massive O7-B3 stars exhibit some combination of soft-spectrum
wind emission, hard-spectrum flaring, and/or rotational modulation indicating
large-scale inhomogeneity, suggesting magnetic confinement of winds with
large-scale shocks.
  Most of the stars in the weak-wind class exhibit X-ray flares and have
luminosities that are consistent with magnetic activity from known or unseen
low-mass companions. All non-detections belong to the weak-wind class.",2005-05-25T06:18:11Z
Probing the Origins of Voids in the Distribution of Galaxies,"If the voids that we see today in the distribution of galaxies existed at
recombination, they will leave an imprint on the cosmic microwave background
(CMB). On the other hand, if these voids formed much later, their effect on the
CMB will be negligible and will not be observed with the current generation of
experiments. In this paper presented at the 2004 Annual Scientific Meeting of
the Astronomical Society of Australia, we discuss our ongoing investigations
into voids of primordial origin. We show that if voids in the cold dark matter
distribution existed at the epoch of decoupling, they could contribute
significantly to the apparent rise in CMB power on small scales detected by the
Cosmic Background Imager (CBI) Deep Field. Here we present our improved method
for predicting the effects of primordial voids on the CMB in which we treat a
void as an external source in the cold dark matter (CDM) distribution employing
a Boltzmann solver. Our improved predictions include the effects of a
cosmological constant (Lambda) and acoustic oscillations generated by voids at
early times. We find that models with relatively large voids on the last
scattering surface predict too much CMB power in an Einstein--de Sitter
background cosmology but could be consistent with the current CMB observations
in a Lambda-CDM universe.",2005-03-30T02:29:03Z
Propagation of UHECRs,"In this general introduction to Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) we
discuss the propagation of UHE protons and the GZK feature that is expected
approaching $10^{20}\eV$ for homogeneously distributed sources. We also briefly
present the effects of the propagation on other particles that can play the
role of UHECRs. With the help of numerical simulations for the propgation of
UHECRs, we show that the GZK feature cannot be accurately determined with the
small sample of events with energies $\sim10^{20}\eV$ detected thus far by the
largest two experiments, AGASA and HiRes.",2005-06-17T13:23:22Z
e-VLBI observations of SN2001em - an off-axis GRB candidate,"Studying transient phenomena with the Very Long Baseline Interferometry
(VLBI) technique faces severe difficulties because the turnaround time of the
experiments from the observations to the scientific result is rather long. The
e-VLBI technique has made it possible to transfer the data from a number of
European VLBI Network (EVN) telescopes to the central data processor at JIVE
through optical fibres, and correlate them in real time. The main goal of this
paper is to introduce this rapidly developing new technique, by presenting
observational results from a recent experiment. We observed SN2001em, a Type
Ib/c supernova with an e-VLBI array and the Multi-Element Radio Linked
Interferometer Network (MERLIN) in the UK. The source is marginally detected in
our observations. We cannot make definite conclusions whether it is resolved at
1.6 GHz or not. Our data show that SN2001em either started fading in the last
couple of months, or its radio spectrum is inverted at low
frequencies,indicating free-free or synchrotron self-absorption. This is quite
unusual, but not unprecedented in radio SNe.",2005-05-23T08:52:09Z
Near-Infrared water lines in V838 Monocerotis,"V838 Monocerotis had an intriguing, nova-like outburst in January 2002 which
has subsequently led to several studies of the object. It is now recognized
that the outburst of V838 Mon and its evolution are different from that of a
classical nova or other classes of well-known eruptive variables. V838 Mon,
along with two other objects that have analogous properties, appears to
comprise a new class of eruptive variables. There are limited infrared studies
of V838 Mon. Here, we present near-infrared H band (1.5 - 1.75micron) spectra
of V838 Mon from late 2002 to the end of 2004. The principal, new result from
our work is the detection of several, rotation-vibration lines of water in the
H band spectra. The observed water lines have been modeled to first establish
that they are indeed due to water. Subsequently the temperature and column
densities of the absorbing material, from where the water absorption features
originate, are derived. From our analysis, we find that the water features
arise from a cool ~750-900 K region around V838 Mon which appears to be
gradually cooling with time.",2005-06-17T03:41:51Z
Transient acceleration from a hybrid Chaplygin gas,"We extend the Chaplygin gas model for dark matter and dark energy unification
by promoting the Chaplygin gas parameter A to the potential for an extra scalar
with canonical kinetic energy. The hybrid model allows for accelerated Hubble
expansion to be a transient effect around redshift zero.",2005-03-19T11:54:06Z
"""Low-state"" Black Hole Accretion in Nearby Galaxies","I summarize the main observational properties of low-luminosity AGNs in
nearby galaxies to argue that they are the high-mass analogs of black hole
X-ray binaries in the ""low/hard"" state. The principal characteristics of
low-state AGNs can be accommodated with a scenario in which the central engine
is comprised of three components: an optically thick, geometrically accretion
disk with a truncated inner radius, a radiatively inefficient flow, and a
compact jet.",2005-04-28T17:23:58Z
"Radial distribution and strong lensing statistics of satellite galaxies
  and substructure using high resolution LCDM hydrodynamical simulations","We analyse the number density and radial distribution of substructures and
satellite galaxies using cosmological simulations that follow the gas dynamics
of a baryonic component, including shock heating, radiative cooling and star
formation within the hierarchical concordance LCDM model. We find that the
dissipation of the baryons greatly enhances the survival of subhaloes,
expecially in the galaxy core, resulting in a radial distribution of satellite
galaxies that closely follows the overall mass distribution in the inner part
of the halo. Hydrodynamical simulations are necessary to resolve the adiabatic
contraction and dense cores of galaxies, resulting in a total number of
satellites a factor of two larger than found in pure dark matter simulation, in
good agreement with the observed spatial distribution of satellite galaxies
within galaxies and clusters. Convergence tests show that the cored
distribution found by previous authors in pure N-body simulations was due to
physical overmerging of dark matter only structures.
  We proceed to use a ray-shooting technique in order to study the impact of
these additional substructures on the number of violations of the cusp caustic
magnification relation. We develop a new approach to try to disentangle the
effect of substructures from the intrinsic discreteness of N-Body simulations.
Even with the increased number of substructures in the centres of galaxies, we
are not able to reproduce the observed high numbers of discrepancies observed
in the flux ratios of multiply lensed quasars.",2005-06-06T20:03:27Z
Evolution of the 0.01 - 25 Hz power spectral components in Cygnus X-1,"Analyzing the archival data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), we
study the power density spectra (PDS) of Cygnus X-1 from 1996 to 2003 in the
frequency range of 0.01 - 25 Hz. With our model we are able to track the
evolution of the Lorentzian components through all spectral states of the
source. We confirm the relation between characteristic frequencies seen both in
black hole candidate and neutron star sources, and show the changes in this
relation during the transitional and soft states of the source. The connection
between the Lorentzian components is investigated by analyzing similarities and
differences in their behavior. We find that the spectral state of the source
can be uniquely determined from the parameters of the these components. The
parameter correlations can all be described by continuous functions, which
differ between components. We discuss our results in the context of
relativistic precession model for the accretion disk, and show a remarkable
agreement between the model prediction and the data in the hard state. We
estimate a value for the specific angular momentum of a=+0.49 (-0.57) in the
case of prograde retrograde) rotation and an estimate for the inner radius of
22 to 50 (25 to 55) gravitational radii.",2005-04-20T16:58:54Z
"Millimeter-wave emission during the 2003 low excitation phase of eta
  Carinae","In this paper we present observations of eta Carinae in the 1.3 mm and 7 mm
radio continuum, during the 2003.5 low excitation phase. The expected minimum
in the light curves was confirmed at both wavelengths and was probably due to a
decrease in the number of UV photons available to ionize the gas surrounding
the binary system. At 7 mm a very well defined peak was superimposed on the
declining flux density. It presented maximum amplitude in 29 June 2003 and
lasted for about 10 days. We show that its origin can be free-free emission
from the gas at the shock formed by wind-wind collision, which is also
responsible for the observed X-ray emission. Even though the shock strength is
strongly enhanced as the two stars in the binary system approach each other,
during periastron passage the X-ray emission is strongly absorbed and the 7 mm
observations represent the only direct evidence of this event.",2005-04-07T13:19:52Z
"New s-process path and its implication to 187Re-187Os
  nucleo-cosmochronometer","We study a new s-process path through an isomer of $^{186}$Re to improve a
$^{187}$Re-$^{187}$Os nucleo-cosmochronometer. The nucleus $^{187}$Re is
produced by this new path of
$^{185}$Re(n,$\gamma$)$^{186}$Re$^m$(n,$\gamma$)$^{187}$Re. We measure a ratio
of neutron capture cross-sections for the $^{185}$Re(n,$\gamma$)$^{186}$Re$^m$
and $^{185}$Re(n,$\gamma$)$^{186}$Re$^{gs}$ reactions at thermal neutron energy
because the ratio with the experimental uncertainty has not been reported.
Using an activation method with reactor neutrons, we obtain the ratio of
$R_{th}$ = 0.54 $\pm$ 0.11%. From this ratio we estimate the ratio of
Maxwellian averaged cross sections in a typical s-process environment at $kT$ =
30 keV with a help of the temperature dependence given in a statistical-model
calculation because the energy dependence of the isomer/ground ratio is smaller
than the absolute neutron capture cross-section. The ratio at $kT$=30 keV is
estimated to be $R_{st}$ = 1.3 $\pm$ 0.8%. We calculate the s-process
contribution from the new path in a steady-flow model. The additional abundance
of $^{187}$Re through this path is estimated to be $N_{s}$ = 0.56 $\pm$ 0.35%
relative to the abundance of $^{186}$Os. This additional increase of $^{187}$Re
does not make any remarkable change in the $^{187}$Re-$^{187}$Os chronometer
for an age estimate of a primitive meteorite, which has recently been found to
be affected strongly by a single supernova r-process episode.",2005-03-30T01:13:38Z
"On the nature of two low M-dot X-ray bursters: 1RXS J170854.4-321857 and
  1RXS J171824.2-402934","We carried out Chandra observations of two low-luminosity low-mass X-ray
binaries, 1RXS J170854.4-321857 and 1RXS J171824.2-402934, for which previously
single X-ray bursts had been detected with the Wide Field Cameras (WFCs) on
board BeppoSAX. Both were detected in our Chandra observations in an actively
accreting state three to eight years after the X-ray bursts, with 0.5-10 keV
luminosities between 5x10^34 and 2x10^36 erg/s. The apparently persistent
nature is remarkable for 1RXS J171824.2-402934 given its low luminosity of
0.001L_Edd. The persistence of both sources also distinguishes them from 5
other low-L bursters, which have also been seen during bursts with the WFCs but
were not detected during Chandra observations above a luminosity of 10^33
erg/s. Those are probably transient rather than persistent sources.",2005-05-25T16:33:53Z
"The open cluster initial-final mass relationship and the high-mass tail
  of the white dwarf distribution","Recent studies of white dwarfs in open clusters have provided new constraints
on the initial - final mass relationship (IFMR) for main sequence stars with
masses in the range 2.5 - 6.5 Mo. We re-evaluate the ensemble of data that
determines the IFMR and argue that the IFMR can be characterised by a mean
initial-final mass relationship about which there is an intrinsic scatter. We
investigate the consequences of the IFMR for the observed mass distribution of
field white dwarfs using population synthesis calculations. We show that while
a linear IFMR predicts a mass distribution that is in reasonable agreement with
the recent results from the PG survey, the data are better fitted by an IFMR
with some curvature. Our calculations indicate that a significant (~28%)
percentage of white dwarfs originating from single star evolution have masses
in excess of ~0.8 Mo, obviating the necessity for postulating the existence of
a dominant population of high-mass white dwarfs that arise from binary star
mergers.",2005-06-14T19:39:36Z
"Pushing the Limits of Ground-Based Photometric Precision --
  Sub-Millimagnitude Time-Series Photometry of the Open Cluster NGC 6791","We present the results from a three night, time-series study of the open
cluster NGC 6791 using the Megacam wide-field mosaic CCD camera on the 6.5m MMT
telescope. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the ability to obtain very
high precision photometry for a large number of stars. We achieved better than
1% precision for more than 8000 stars with 14.3 < R < 20.1 and
sub-millimagnitude (as low as 0.36 mmag) precision for over 300 stars with 14.6
< R < 16.3 in the field of this cluster. We also discovered 8 new variable
stars, including a possible delta-Scuti variable with an amplitude of 2%, 6
likely W UMa contact binaries, and a possible RS CVn star, and we identified 5
suspected low-amplitude variables, including one star with an amplitude of 3
mmag. We comment on the implications of this study for a ground-based survey
for transiting planets as small as Neptune.",2005-04-21T21:10:16Z
Spectroscopy of the type Ia supernova SN 2002er: days -11 to +215,"We present an extensive set of optical spectroscopy of the nearby type Ia
supernova, SN 2002er, with 24 epochs spanning -11 to +34 days. Its spectral
evolution is fairly typical of a type Ia supernova although it suffers high
extinction. Nevertheless, there are differences in the spectral evolution when
compared to coeval spectra of other normal type Ia supernova with comparable
decline-rate parameters. Modelling of the photospheric phase spectra using a
homogeneous abundance distribution in the atmosphere provides a fair match to
the observations, but only by pushing the adopted distance and risetime close
to the observational limits. Future improvements here will require models with
a more realtistic stratified abundance distribution. From simple modelling of a
nebular spectrum obtained at +215d, we infer a 56Ni mass of 0.69Msun,
consistent with that derived from the light curve.",2005-03-16T10:47:22Z
"Formation of Population III Stars in Fossil HII Regions: Significance of
  HD","We study the evolution of gas in HII regions around the first stars after the
death of the exciting stars. If the first star in a small halo dies without
supernova (SN), subsequent star formation is possible in the same halo. We thus
investigate the effect of ionization of the gas on subsequent star formation
within small halos in the early universe using one-dimensional hydrodynamics
with spherical symmetry along with non-equilibrium primordial gas chemistry. We
find that the enhanced electron fraction facilitates the formation of molecular
hydrogen at the cores of these halos. The low temperature circumstances
produced by the H_2 cooling is suitable for HD formation and the resultant
cooling further drops the temperature below 100 K. Consequently, low-mass stars
with primordial abundances can form even in a small halo. After accreting the
interstellar metals, these stars might resemble low-mass ultra metal-poor stars
discovered in the present Galactic halo.",2005-05-30T15:31:27Z
Coupling Quintessence to Inflation in Supergravity,"The evolution of the quintessence field during a phase of chaotic inflation
is studied. The inflaton and the quintesssence field are described in a
supergravity framework where the coupling between the inflaton and quintessence
is induced by non-renormalisable operators suppressed by the Planck mass. We
show that the resulting quintessence potential during inflation possesses a
time--dependent minimum playing the role of an attractor. The presence of this
attractor forces the quintessence field to be small during inflation. These
initial conditions are such that the quintessence field is on tracks now.",2005-02-03T14:48:50Z
On the determination of the deceleration parameter from Supernovae data,"Supernovae searches have shown that a simple matter-dominated and
decelerating universe should be ruled out. However a determination of the
present deceleration parameter $q_0$ through a simple kinematical description
is not exempt of possible drawbacks. We show that, with a time dependent
equation of state for the dark energy, a bias is present for $q_0$ : models
which are very far from the so-called Concordance Model can be accommodated by
the data and a simple kinematical analysis can lead to wrong conclusions. We
present a quantitative treatment of this bias and we present our conclusions
when a possible dynamical dark energy is taken into account.",2005-02-08T15:49:00Z
Radiative Transfer and Acceleration in Magnetocentrifugal Winds,"Detailed photoionization and radiative acceleration of self-similar
magnetocentrifugal accretion disk winds are explored. First, a general-purpose
hybrid magnetocentrifugal and radiatively-driven wind model is defined.
Solutions are then examined to determine how radiative acceleration modifies
magnetocentrifugal winds and how those winds can influence radiative driving in
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). For the models studied here, both radiative
acceleration by bound-free (``continuum-driving'') and bound-bound
(``line-driving'') processes are found to be important, although magnetic
driving dominates the mass outflow rate for the Eddington ratios studied
(L/L_Edd = 0.001 - 0.1). The solutions show that shielding by a
magnetocentrifugal wind can increase the efficiency of a radiatively-driven
wind, and also that, within a magnetocentrifugal wind, radiative acceleration
is sensitive to both the column in the shield, the column of the wind and the
initial density at the base of the wind.",2005-06-14T20:04:13Z
Orbital modulation of emission of the binary pulsar J0737-3039B,"In binary radio pulsar system J0737-3039, slow pulsar B shows orbital
modulations of intensity, being especially bright at two short orbital phases.
We propose that these modulations are due to distortion of pulsar B
magnetosphere by pulsar A wind which produces orbital phase-dependent changes
of the direction along which radio waves are emitted. In our model, pulsar B is
intrinsically bright at all times but its radiation beam misses the Earth at
most orbital phases. We employ a simple model of distorted B magnetosphere
using stretching transformations of Euler potentials of dipolar fields. To fit
observations we use parameters of pulsar B derived from modeling of A eclipses
(Lyutikov and Thompson 2005). The model reproduces two bright regions
approximately at the observed orbital phases, explains variations of the pulse
shape between them and regular timing residuals within each emission window. It
also makes predictions for timing properties and secular variations of pulsar B
profiles.",2005-02-24T16:36:13Z
"The all-sky distribution of 511 keV electron-positron annihilation
  emission","We present a map of 511 keV electron-positron annihilation emission, based on
data accumulated with the SPI spectrometer aboard ESA's INTEGRAL gamma-ray
observatory, that covers approximately 95% of the celestial sphere. 511 keV
line emission is significantly detected towards the galactic bulge region and,
at a very low level, from the galactic disk. The bulge emission is highly
symmetric and is centred on the galactic centre with an extension of 8 deg. The
emission is equally well described by models that represent the stellar bulge
or halo populations. The disk morphology is only weakly constrained by the
present data, being compatible with both the distribution of young and old
stellar populations. The 511 keV line flux from the bulge and disk components
is 1.05e-3 ph cm-2 s-1 and 0.7e-3 ph cm-2 s-1, respectively, corresponding to a
bulge-to-disk flux ratio in the range 1-3. Assuming a positronium fraction of
0.93 this translates into annihilation rates of 1.5e43 s-1 and 3e42 s-1,
respectively. The ratio of the bulge luminosity to that of the disk is in the
range 3-9. We find no evidence for a point-like source in addition to the
diffuse emission, down to a typical flux limit of 1e-4 ph cm-2 s-1. We also
find no evidence for the positive latitude enhancement that has been reported
from OSSE measurements; our 3 sigma upper flux limit for this feature is 1.5e-4
ph cm-2 s-1. The disk emission can be attributed to the beta+ decay of the
radioactive species 26Al and 44Ti. The bulge emission arises from a different
source which has only a weak or no disk component. We suggest that Type Ia
supernovae and/or low-mass X-ray binaries are the prime candidates for the
source of the galactic bulge positrons. Light dark matter annihilation could
also explain the observed 511 keV bulge emission characteristics.",2005-06-01T18:47:26Z
Microquasars and Jets,"I present an overview of past, present and future research on microquasars
and jets, showing that microquasars, i.e. galactic jet sources, are among the
best laboratories for high energy phenomena. After remindind the analogy with
quasars, I focus on one of the best microquasar representatives, probably the
archetype, namely GRS 1915+105, and present accretion and ejection phenomena,
showing that only a multi-wavelength approach allows a better understanding of
phenomena occuring in these sources. Thereafter, I review jets at different
scales: compact jets, large-scale jets, and the interactions between ejections
and the surrounding medium. I finish by speaking about microblazars and
ultraluminous X-ray sources.",2005-06-01T07:28:15Z
"A short gamma-ray burst apparently asssociated with an elliptical galaxy
  at redshift z=0.225","Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are bright, brief flashes of high energy photons that
have fascinated scientists for 30 years. They come in two classes: long (>2 s),
softspectrum bursts and short, hard events. The major progress to date on
understanding GRBs has been for long bursts which are typically at high
redshift (z ~ 1) and are in sub-luminous star-forming host galaxies. They are
likely produced in core-collapse explosions of massive stars. Until the present
observation, no short GRB had been accurately (<10"") and rapidly (minutes)
located. Here we report the detection of X-ray afterglow from and the
localization of short burst GRB050509b. Its position on the sky is near a
luminous, non-starforming elliptical galaxy at a redshift of 0.225, exactly the
type of location one would expect if the origin of this GRB is the
long-proposed fiery merger of neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH) binaries.
The X-ray afterglow is found to be weak and fading below detection within a few
hours and no optical afterglow is detected to stringent limits, explaining the
past difficulty in localizing short GRBs.",2005-05-31T18:57:50Z
"The gamma-ray giant flare from SGR1806-20: Evidence for crustal cracking
  via initial timescales","We report here on serendipitous observations of the intense gamma-ray flare
from SGR 1806-20 that occured on 27 December 2004. Unique data from the Cluster
and Double Star-2 satellites, designed to study the Earth's magnetosphere,
provide the first observational evidence of three separate timescales within
the early (first 100ms) phases of this class of events. These observations
reveal that, in addition to the initial very steep (<0.25ms) X-ray onset, there
is firstly a 4.9ms exponential rise timescale followed by a continued
exponential rise in intensity on a timescale of 70ms. These three timescales
are a prominent feature of current theoretical models including the timescale
(several ms) for fracture propagation in the crust of the neutron star.",2005-04-03T22:35:30Z
Core Structure of Intracluster Gas: Isothermal Hydrostatic Equilibrium,"We investigate core structures of X-ray emitting intracluster gas based on
the so-called beta-model, which is an isothermal hydrostatic model often used
in observational studies. We reconsider the beta-model and find that the virial
temperature T_vir of a cluster may be represented better by beta T_X than T_X,
where beta is the parameter obtained from the X-ray surface brightness and T_X
is the emission-weighted mean temperature of the gas. We investigate 121
clusters observed by ROSAT and ASCA and find that the luminosity-temperature
relation L_X - beta T_X is less steep than L_X - T_X. We classify the clusters
into two core-size groups in order to investigate their properties in detail.
While in the larger core group the core radius is marginally proportional to
the virial radius, no significant relation is found for the smaller core group.
This may suggest that the smaller cores reflect the presence of cD galaxies,
effect of radiative cooling or asymmetry in the surface brightness. We examine
such possibilities, and find that the clusters of smaller cores have shorter
cooling time than the Hubble time, while no significant correlation is found
with cD or asymmetry. We carry out hydrodynamical calculations to simulate the
beta-model, intending to see the behavior of the isothermal gas under the
gravitational potential including the dark matter and galaxies with or without
a central cD galaxy. Calculations show r_c \propto r_vir and T_vir \simeq beta
T consistently with our consideration to the beta-model. Also is found from
calculations that the presence of a large cD galaxy may form a gas core \sim 40
kpc, which seems too small to account for the range of the core sizes, 40--80
kpc, of the smaller core group.",2005-04-05T09:00:00Z
"Star Cluster Survival in Star Cluster Complexes under Extreme Residual
  Gas Expulsion","After the stars of a new, embedded star cluster have formed they blow the
remaining gas out of the cluster. Especially winds of massive stars and
definitely the on-set of the first supernovae can remove the residual gas from
a cluster. This leads to a very violent mass-loss and leaves the cluster out of
dynamical equilibrium. Standard models predict that within the cluster volume
the star formation efficiency (SFE) has to be about 33 per cent for sudden
(within one crossing-time of the cluster) gas expulsion to retain some of the
stars in a bound cluster. If the efficiency is lower the stars of the cluster
disperse mostly. Recent observations reveal that in strong star bursts star
clusters do not form in isolation but in complexes containing dozens and up to
several hundred star clusters, i.e. in super-clusters. By carrying out
numerical experiments for such objects placed at distances >= 10 kpc from the
centre of the galaxy we demonstrate that under these conditions (i.e. the
deeper potential of the star cluster complex and the merging process of the
star clusters within these super-clusters) the SFEs can be as low as 20 per
cent and still leave a gravitationally bound stellar population. Such an object
resembles the outer Milky Way globular clusters and the faint fuzzy star
clusters recently discovered in NGC 1023.",2005-05-19T16:00:25Z
Radiation in the process of the formation of voids,"This paper aims to investigate the influence of inhomogeneous radiation in
void formation. Since the process of void formation is non-linear, a fully
relativistic model, which simulates the evolution of voids from the moment of
the last scattering until the present instant, is presented. It is found that
in order to obtain a model of a void which evolves from $\delta_0 = - 10^{-5}$
at the last scattering moment to the present day $\delta = - 0.94$, the
existence of radiation must be taken into account. The ratio of radiation
energy density to matter energy density in CDM models at the moment of last
scattering is 1/5. This paper proves that such a value of radiation energy
density cannot be neglected and influences the first stages of void evolution.
Namely, it is important to the process of structure formation and hence
significantly influences the dynamics of the Universe in the first millions of
years after the last scattering.
  From the fact that the evolution of voids proceeds differently in various
cosmological background models we use the process of void formation to put some
limits on values of cosmological parameters. We find that the model with
$\Omega_{mat} \approx 0.3$ fits the observational data best.",2005-03-16T17:26:41Z
"A Digital Archive of HI 21 cm Line Spectra of Optically-targeted
  Galaxies","We present a homogeneous compilation of HI spectral parameters extracted from
global 21 cm line spectra for some 9000 galaxies in the local universe
(heliocentric velocity -200 < V_Sun < 28,000 km/s) obtained with a variety of
large single dish radio telescopes but reanalyzed using a single set of
parameter extraction algorithms. Corrections to the observed HI line flux for
source extent and pointing offsets and to the HI line widths for instrumental
broadening and smoothing are applied according to model estimates to produce a
homogenous catalog of derived properties with quantitative error estimates.
Where the redshift is available from optical studies, we also provide flux
measurements for an additional 156 galaxies classified as marginal HI
detections and rms noise limits for 494 galaxies classified as nondetections.
Given the diverse nature of the observing programs contributing to it, the
characteristics of the combined dataset are heterogeneous, and as such, the
compilation is neither integrated HI line flux nor peak flux limited. However,
because of the large statistical base and homogenous reprocessing, the spectra
and spectral parameters of galaxies in this optically targeted sample can be
used to complement data obtained at other wavelengths to characterize the
properties of galaxies in the local universe and to explore the large scale
structures in which they reside.",2005-05-02T14:30:01Z
"Age and Metallicity Estimations in Old Stellar Populations from
  Stromgren Photometry","We present a new technique to determine age and metallicity of old stellar
populations (globular clusters and elliptical galaxies) using an iterative
principal component analysis on narrow band (Str\""omgren) colors. Our technique
is capable of reproducing globular cluster [Fe/H] values to 0.02 dex and CMD
ages to 1.0 Gyrs. We also present preliminary results on the application of our
technique to a sample of high mass, field ellipticals and low mass, cluster
dwarf ellipticals. We confirm the results of earlier studies which find that
globular clusters increase in metallicity with age and that age and metallicity
increase with galaxy mass. However, we find that dwarf ellipticals deviate from
the elliptical sequence by having little to no correlation between age and
metallicity.",2005-04-29T19:41:28Z
"A General Theory of Turbulence-Regulated Star Formation, From Spirals to
  ULIRGs","We derive an analytic prediction for the star formation rate in environments
ranging from normal galactic disks to starbursts and ULIRGs in terms of the
observables of those systems. Our calculation is based on three premises: (1)
star formation occurs in virialized molecular clouds that are supersonically
turbulent; (2) the density distribution within these clouds is lognormal, as
expected for supersonic isothermal turbulence; (3) stars form in any sub-region
of a cloud that is so overdense that its gravitational potential energy exceeds
the energy in turbulent motions. We show that a theory based on this model is
consistent with simulations and with the observed star formation rate in the
Milky Way. We use our theory to derive the Kennicutt-Schmidt Law from first
principles, and make other predictions that can be tested by future
observations. We also provide an algorithm for estimating the star formation
rate that is suitable for inclusion in numerical simulations.",2005-05-09T20:32:18Z
"Effects of ion and electron correlations on neutrino scattering in the
  infall phase of a supernova","Many authors have used one-component plasma simulations in discussing the
role of ion-ion correlations in reducing neutrino opacities during the collapse
phase of a supernova. In a multicomponent plasma in which constituent ions have
even a small range of N/Z ratios neutrino opacities are much larger, in some
regions of parameters, than for the case of a one component plasma.",2005-05-26T03:13:59Z
The Complex Wind Torus and Jets of PSR B1706-44,"We report on Chandra ACIS imaging of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) of the
young Vela-like PSR B1706-44, which shows the now common pattern of an
equatorial wind and polar jets. The structure is particularly rich, showing a
relativistically boosted termination shock, jets with strong confinement, a
surrounding radio/X-ray PWN and evidence for a quasi-static `bubble nebula'.
The structures trace the pulsar spin geometry and illuminate its possible
relation to SNR G343.1-2.3. We also obtain improved estimates of the pulsar
flux and nebular spectrum, constraining the system age and energetics.",2005-06-03T21:58:24Z
Mid-infrared imaging of NGC1068 with VISIR at the VLT,"High resolution mid-infrared (MIR) images of the central region of NGC1068
have been obtained with VISIR, the multi-mode MIR instrument recently installed
at the ESO/VLT on Paranal. A map of the emission at 12.8mic with increased
sensitivity over the central 8""x 8"" area is discussed. It shows a central core
(unresolved along the E-W direction) and an extended emission which draws a
spiral pattern similar to that observed on near-infrared images. Patches of MIR
emission can be detected up to a distance of 4"" from the core. The deconvolved
12.8mic map is fully consistent with previous high-resolution MIR observations.
It highlights the structure of the extended emission, already seen on the
un-deconvolved image, and allows to identify a set of mid-infrared sources: 7
in the NE quadrant and 5 in the SW quadrant. The MIR emission map is compared
with those obtained at comparable angular resolution in the near-infrared and
in the [OIII] line emission. The very good correlation between the VISIR map
and the HST optical map supports the idea that the MIR emission not associated
with the torus arises from dust associated with the narrow line region clouds.
The N-S extension of the MIR core (0.44"") is then probably simply due to the
mixing of the MIR emission from the dusty torus and the MIR emission from NLR
cloud B, located only 0.1"" to the North.",2005-06-03T05:12:45Z
"Supernova Blastwaves in Low-density Hot Media: a Mechanism for Spatially
  Distributed Heating","Most supernovae are expected to explode in low-density hot media,
particularly in galactic bulges and elliptical galaxies. The remnants of such
supernovae, though difficult to detect individually, can be profoundly
important in heating the media on large scales. We characterize the evolution
of this kind of supernova remnants, based on analytical approximations and
hydrodynamic simulations. We generalize the standard Sedov solution to account
for both temperature and density effects of the ambient media. Although cooling
can be neglected, the expansion of such a remnant deviates quickly from the
standard Sedov solution and asymptotically approaches the ambient sound speed
as the swept-up thermal energy becomes important. The relatively steady and
fast expansion of the remnants over large volumes provides an ideal mechanism
for spatially distributed heating, which may help to alleviate the over-cooling
problem of hot gas in groups and clusters of galaxies as well as in galaxies
themselves. The simulations were performed with the FLASH code.",2005-04-13T04:22:43Z
"The obscuration by dust of most of the growth of supermassive black
  holes","Supermassive black holes underwent periods of exponential growth during which
we seem them as quasars in the distant Universe. The summed emission from these
quasars generates the cosmic X-ray background, the spectrum of which has been
used to argue that most black-hole growth is obscured. There are clear examples
of obscured black-hole growth in the form of `type-2' quasars, but their
numbers are fewer than expected from modelling of the X-ray background. Here we
report on the direct detection of a population of distant type-2 quasars which
is at least comparable in size to the well-known unobscured type-1 population.
We selected objects that have mid-infrared and radio emissions characteristic
of quasars, but which are faint at near-infrared and optical wavelengths. This
population is responsible for most of the black hole growth in the young
Universe and, throughout cosmic history, black-hole growth occurs in the dusty,
gas-rich centres of active galaxies.",2005-05-24T09:14:07Z
A New Model for Iron Emission Lines and Re-Burst in GRB X-Ray Afterglows,"Recently iron emission features have been observed in several X-ray
afterglows of GRBs. It is found that the energy obtained from the illuminating
continuum which produces the emission lines is much higher than that of the
main burst.The observation of SN-GRB association indicates a fallback disk
should be formed after the supernovae explosion. The disk is optically thick
and advection-dominated and dense. We suggest that the delayed injection energy
after the initial main burst, much higher than energy of the main burst, causes
the re-burst appearance in GRB afterglow and illuminates the region of the disk
surface with $\tau\approx1$($\tau$ is the optical depth for the Thomson scatter
) and produces the iron emission line whose luminosity can be up to $10^{45}$
erg$s^{-1}$. The duration of the iron line emission can be $10^{4}-10^{5}$ s.
This model can explain the appearance of re-burst and emission lines in GRB
afterglow and disappearance of the iron emission lines, and also can naturally
solve the problem of higher energy of the illuminating continuum than that of
the main burst. This scenario is different from the models put forward to
explain the emission lines before, that can be tested by SWIFT satellite.",2005-04-25T07:44:45Z
Galactic Centre stellar winds and Sgr A* accretion,"(ABRIDGED) We present in detail our new 3D numerical models for the accretion
of stellar winds on to Sgr A*. In our most sophisticated models, we put stars
on realistic orbits around Sgr A*, include `slow' winds (300 km/s), and account
for radiative cooling. We first model only one phase `fast' stellar winds (1000
km/s). For wind sources fixed in space, the accretion rate is Mdot ~ 1e-5
Msun/yr, fluctuates by < 10%, and is in a good agreement with previous models.
In contrast, Mdot decreases by an order of magnitude for stars following
circular orbits, and fluctuates by ~ 50%. Then we allow a fraction of stars to
produce slow winds. Much of these winds cool radiatively, forming cold clumps
immersed into the X-ray emitting gas. We test two orbital configurations for
the stars in this scenario, an isotropic distribution and two rotating discs
with perpendicular orientation. The morphology of cold gas is quite sensitive
to the orbits. In both cases, however, most of the accreted gas is hot, with an
almost constant Mdot ~ 3e-6 Msun/yr, consistent with Chandra observations. The
cold gas accretes in intermittent, short but powerful episodes which may give
rise to large amplitude variability in the luminosity of Sgr A* on time scales
of 10s to 100s of years. The circularisation radii for the flows are ~ 1e3 and
1e4 Rsch, for the one and two-phase wind simulations, respectively, never
forming the quasi-spherical accretion flows suggested in some previous work.
Our work suggests that, averaged over time scales of 100s to 1000s of years,
the radiative and mechanical luminosity of Sgr A* may be substantially higher
than it is in its current state. Further improvements of the wind accretion
modelling of Sgr A* will rely on improved observational constraints for the
wind properties and stellar orbits.",2005-05-18T17:06:44Z

"A Fuzzy Logic Based Algorithm for Finding Astronomical Objects in
  Wide-Angle Frames","Accurate automatic identification of astronomical objects in an imperfect
world of non-linear wide-angle optics, imperfect optics, inaccurately pointed
telescopes, and defect-ridden cameras is not always a trivial first step. In
the past few years, this problem has been exacerbated by the rise of digital
imaging, providing vast digital streams of astronomical images and data. In the
modern age of increasing bandwidth, human identifications are many times
impracticably slow. In order to perform an automatic computer-based analysis of
astronomical frames, a quick and accurate identification of astronomical
objects is required. Such identification must follow a rigorous transformation
from topocentric celestial coordinates into image coordinates on a CCD frame.
This paper presents a fuzzy logic based algorithm that estimates needed
coordinate transformations in a practical setting. Using a training set of
reference stars, the algorithm statically builds a fuzzy logic model. At
runtime, the algorithm uses this model to associate stellar objects visible in
the frames to known-catalogued objects, and generates files that contain
photometry information of objects visible in the frame. Use of this algorithm
facilitates real-time monitoring of stars and bright transients, allowing
identifications and alerts to be issued more reliably. The algorithm is being
implemented by the Night Sky Live all-sky monitoring global network and has
shown itself significantly more reliable than the previously used non-fuzzy
logic algorithm.",2005-02-25T19:24:49Z
"Homeoidally striated density profiles: sequences of virial equilibrium
  configurations with constant anisotropy parameters","The formulation of the tensor virial equations is generalized to unrelaxed
configurations, where virial equilibrium does not coincide with dynamical (or
hydrostatic) equilibrium. Further investigation is devoted to special classes
of homeoidally striated ellipsoids, defined as homeoidally striated, Jacobi
ellipsoids. In particular, virial equilibrium configurations with constant
anisotropy parameters are studied with more detail, including both flattened
and elongated, triaxial configurations, and the determination of the related
bifurcation points. The explicit expression of different rotation parameters is
also determined. An application is made to dark matter haloes hosting giant,
galaxies, with regard to assigned initial and final configuration, following
and generalizing to many respects a procedure conceived by Thuan & Gott (1975).
The dependence of the limiting axis ratios, below which no configuration is
allowed for the sequence under consideration, on the change in mass, total
energy, and angular momentum, during the evolution, is illustrated in some
representative situations. The dependence of axis ratios and rotation
parameters on an additional parameter, related to the initial conditions of the
density perturbation, is analysed in connection with a few special cases.
Within the range of Peebles (1969) rotation parameter, inferred from
high-resolution numerical simulations, the shape of dark matter haloes is
mainly decided by the amount of anisotropy in residual velocity distribution.
On the other hand, the contribution of rotation has only a minor effect on the
meridional plane, and no effect on the equatorial plane, as bifurcation points
occur for larger values of Peebles (1969) rotation parameter. To this respect,
dark matter haloes are found to resemble giant elliptical galaxies.",2005-05-14T10:12:45Z
"Spurious 'active longitudes' in parametric models of heavily spotted
  eclipsing binaries","In this paper, size distributions of starspots extrapolated from the case of
the Sun, are modelled on the eclipsing binary SV Cam to synthesise images of
stellar photospheres with high spot filling factors. These spot distributions
pepper the primary's surface with spots, many of which are below the resolution
capabilities of eclipse mapping and Doppler imaging techniques. The lightcurves
resulting from these modelled distributions are used to determine the
limitations of image reconstruction from photometric data. Surface brightness
distributions reconstructed from these lightcurves show distinctive spots on
the primary star at its quadrature points. It is concluded that two-spot
modelling or chi-squared minimisation techniques are more susceptible to
spurious structures being generated by systematic errors, arising from
incorrect assumptions about photospheric surface brightness, than simple
Fourier analysis of the light-curves.",2005-04-28T17:32:11Z
The Lyth Bound Revisited,"We investigate the Lyth relationship between the tensor-scalar ratio, r, and
the variation of the inflaton field, Delta phi, over the course of inflation.
For inflationary models that produce at least 55 e-folds of inflation, there is
a correlation between r and Delta phi as anticipated by Lyth, but the scatter
around the relationship is huge. However, for inflationary models that satisfy
current observational constraints on the scalar spectral index and its first
derivative, the Lyth relationship is much tighter. In particular, any
inflationary model with r > 10^-3 must have Delta phi > m_pl. Large field
variations are therefore required if a tensor mode signal is to be detected in
any foreseeable cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization experiment.",2005-03-16T17:44:05Z
AB Aurigae Resolved: Evidence for Spiral Structure,"We obtained high angular resolution (~2"") images of the 13CO(J=1-0) line and
2.7 millimeter continuum emission, and slightly lower resolution images of
12CO(J=1-0) and C18O(J=1-0) line emission toward the Herbig Ae star AB Aurigae.
We resolve a circumstellar disk of diameter 780 AU (FWHM) with a velocity
pattern consistent with a purely rotational disk at inclination 21.5 degrees
and position angle 58.6 degrees. Using Keplerian disk models, we find a central
source dynamical mass of 2.8+-0.1 Msun and a cutoff radius of 615 AU for the
13CO emission. Inclination, mass, and radius determined from 12CO and C18O
observations agree with those values, given optical depth and abundance
effects. As a result of the high angular resolution of our observations, we
confirm the existence of spiral structure suggested by near-IR scattered light
images and show that the spiral arms represent density contrasts in the disk.",2005-02-07T19:30:57Z
Secular Evolution Via Bar-Driven Gas Inflow: Results from BIMA SONG,"We present an analysis of the molecular gas distributions in the 29 barred
and 15 unbarred spirals in BIMA SONG. For CO-bright galaxies, we confirm the
conclusion by Sakamoto et al. (1999b) that barred spirals have higher molecular
gas concentrations in the central kiloparsec. The SONG sample also includes 27
galaxies below the CO brightness limit used by Sakamoto et al. Even in these
CO-faint galaxies we show that high central gas concentrations are more common
in barred galaxies, consistent with radial inflow driven by the bar. However,
there is a significant population of early-type (Sa--Sbc) barred spirals (6 of
19) that have little or no molecular gas detected in the nuclear region and out
to the bar co-rotation radius. In these galaxies, the bar has already driven
most of the gas within the bar to the nuclear region, where it has been
consumed by star formation. The median nuclear gas mass is over four times
higher in early type bars; since the gas consumption rate is an order of
magnitude higher in early type bars, early types must have significantly higher
bar-driven inflows. The lower inflow rates in late type bars can be attributed
to differences in bar structure between early and late types. Despite
bar-driven inflows, the data indicate that it is highly unlikely for a late
type galaxy to evolve into an early type via bar-induced gas inflow.
Nonetheless, secular evolutionary processes are undoubtedly present, and
pseudo-bulges are inevitable; evidence for pseudo-bulges is likely to be
clearest in early-type galaxies because of their high gas inflow rates and
higher star formation activity (abridged).",2005-05-18T21:09:38Z
"Generation of Mesoscale Magnetic Fields and the Dynamics of Cosmic Ray
  Acceleration","The problem of the cosmic ray origin is discussed in connection with their
acceleration in supernova remnant shocks. The diffusive shock acceleration
mechanism is reviewed and its potential to accelerate particles to the maximum
energy of (presumably) galactic cosmic rays ($10^{18}eV $) is considered. It is
argued that to reach such energies, a strong magnetic field at scales larger
than the particle gyroradius must be created as a result of the acceleration
process, itself. One specific mechanism suggested here is based on the
generation of Alfven wave at the gyroradius scale with a subsequent transfer to
longer scales via interaction with strong acoustic turbulence in the shock
precursor. The acoustic turbulence in turn, may be generated by Drury
instability or by parametric instability of the Alfven waves.",2005-06-09T22:41:18Z
The Formation of Galactic Bulges,"We summarise some recent results about nearby galactic bulges that are
relevant to their formation. We highlight a number of significant advances in
our understanding of the surface brightness profiles, stellar populations, and
especially the very centers of spiral galaxies. We also view our own Milky Way
as if it were an external galaxy. Our main conclusions are that bulges of
early-type spirals (S0 -- Sb) contain central nuclear components, just like
late-type spirals and most other types of galaxies. The luminosities of these
central components correlate best with total bulge luminosity, and not as well
with morphological type. Bulges of early-type spiral galaxies follow the
fundamental plane and the colour/line strength vs. luminosity relations of
elliptical galaxies. Although we have a reasonable idea about bulges of
early-type spirals we know much less about late-type bulges. However, the close
resemblance of our Milky Way Bulge to bulges in external disk galaxies makes us
suspect that bulges of late-type spirals might be very similar as well.",2005-02-15T08:39:22Z
"Stellar evolution with rotation and magnetic fields:III: The interplay
  of circulation and dynamo","We examine the effects of the magnetic field created by the Tayler--Spruit
dynamo in differentially rotating stars. Magnetic fields of the order of a few
$10^4$ G are present through most of the stellar envelope, with the exception
of the outer layers. The diffusion coefficient for the transport of angular
momentum is very large and it imposes nearly solid body rotation during the MS
phase. In turn, solid body rotation drives meridional circulation currents
which are much faster than usual and leads to much larger diffusion
coefficients than the magnetic diffusivity for the chemical species. The
consequence is that the interplay of the thermal and magnetic instabilities
favours the chemical transport of elements, while there would be no transport
in models with magnetic field only. We also discuss the effects on the stellar
interior, lifetimes and HR diagram.",2005-06-15T15:49:01Z
Study of 23 day periodicity of Blazar Mkn501 in 1997,"We confirm a 23 day periodicity during a large flare in 1997 for X-ray data
of X-ray satellite RXTE all sky monitor(ASM), 2 TeV gamma ray data from Utah
Seven Telescope and HEGRA, with a Fourier analysis. We found the three results
to be the same with a newly estimated error. We confirm the presence of a
frequency dependent power (1/f noise) in a frequency-power diagram. Further, we
calculated a chance probability of the occurrence of the 23 day periodicity by
considering the 1/f noise and obtained a chance probability 4.88*10^-3 for the
HEGRA data: this is more significant than previous result by an order. We also
obtained an identical peridoicity with another kind of timing analysis-epoch
folding method for the ASM data and HEGRA data. We strongly suggest an
existence of the periodicity. We divided the HEGRA data into two data sets,
analyzed them with a Fourier method, and found an unstableness of the
periodicity with a 3.4 sigma significance. We also analyzed an energy spectra
of the X-ray data of a RXTE proportional counter array and we found that a
combination of three parameters-a magnetic field, a Lorentz factor, and a
beaming factor-is related to the periodicity.",2005-06-14T23:38:39Z
Double nucleus in M83,"M 83 is one of the nearest galaxies with an enhanced nuclear star formation
and it presents one of the best opportunities to study the kinematics and
physical properties of a circumnuclear starburst. Our three-dimensional
spectroscopy data in R band confirm the presence of a secondary nucleus or mass
concentration (previously suggested by Thatte and coworkers). We determine the
position of this hidden nucleus, which would be more massive than the visible
one, and was not detected in the optical HST images due, probably, to the
strong dust extinction. The optical nucleus has a mass of 5 x 10^6 M_Sun / sin
i (r < 1''.5), and the hidden nucleus, located 3''.9 +/- 0''.5 at the NW (PA
271 +/- 15 deg) of the optical nucleus, would have a mass of 1 x 10^7 M_Sun /
sin i (r < 1''.5). The emission line ratio map also unveils the presence of a
second circumnuclear ring structure, previously discovered by IR imaging
(Elmegreen and coworkers). The data allow us to resolve the behavior of the
interstellar medium inside the circumnuclear ring and around the binary mass
concentration.",2005-05-12T17:50:35Z
"The Chromospheric Activity and Ages of M Dwarf Stars in Wide Binary
  Systems","We investigate the relationship between age and chromospheric activity for
139 M dwarf stars in wide binary systems with white dwarf companions. The age
of each system is determined from the cooling age of its white dwarf component.
The current limit for activity-age relations found for M dwarfs in open
clusters is 4 Gyr. Our unique approach to finding ages for M stars allows for
the exploration of this relationship at ages older than 4 Gyr. The general
trend of stars remaining active for a longer time at later spectral type is
confirmed. However, our larger sample and greater age range reveals additional
complexity in assigning age based on activity alone. We find that M dwarfs in
wide binaries older than 4 Gyr depart from the log-linear relation for clusters
and are found to have activity at magnitudes, colors and masses which are
brighter, bluer and more massive than predicted by the cluster relation. In
addition to our activity-age results, we present the measured radial velocities
and complete space motions for 161 white dwarf stars in wide binaries.",2005-02-16T00:01:30Z
"Thermal and Fragmentation Properties of Star-forming Clouds in
  Low-metallicity Environments","The thermal and chemical evolution of star-forming clouds is studied for
different gas metallicities, Z, using the model of Omukai (2000), updated to
include deuterium chemistry and the effects of cosmic microwave background
(CMB) radiation. HD-line cooling dominates the thermal balance of clouds when Z
\~ 10^{-5}-10^{-3} Z_sun and density ~10^{5} cm^{-3}. Early on, CMB radiation
prevents the gas temperature to fall below T_CMB, although this hardly alters
the cloud thermal evolution in low-metallicity gas. From the derived
temperature evolution, we assess cloud/core fragmentation as a function of
metallicity from linear perturbation theory, which requires that the core
elongation E := (b-a)/a > E_NL ~ 1, where a (b) is the short (long) core axis
length. The fragment mass is given by the thermal Jeans mass at E = E_NL. Given
these assumptions and the initial (gaussian) distribution of E we compute the
fragment mass distribution as a function of metallicity. We find that: (i) For
Z=0, all fragments are very massive, > 10^{3}M_sun, consistently with previous
studies; (ii) for Z>10^{-6} Z_sun a few clumps go through an additional high
density (> 10^{10} cm^{-3}) fragmentation phase driven by dust-cooling, leading
to low-mass fragments; (iii) The mass fraction in low-mass fragments is
initially very small, but at Z ~ 10^{-5}Z_sun it becomes dominant and continues
to grow as Z is increased; (iv) as a result of the two fragmentation modes, a
bimodal mass distribution emerges in 0.01 < Z/Z_sun < 0.1. (v) For > 0.1Z_sun,
the two peaks merge into a singly-peaked mass function which might be regarded
as the precursor of the ordinary Salpeter-like IMF.",2005-03-01T05:28:14Z
"Long-Term Radio Modulation in Sagittarius A* from Spin-Induced Disk
  Precession","There is some evidence, though yet unconfirmed, that Sagittarius A*--the
supermassive black hole at the Galactic center--emits its radio waves modulated
with a ~100-day period. What is intriguing about this apparent
quasi-periodicity is that, though the amplitude of the modulation increases
with decreasing wavelength (from 3.6 to 1.3 cm), the quasi-period itself does
not seem to depend on the frequency of the radiation. It is difficult to
imagine how a binary companion, were that the cause of this modulation, could
have escaped detection until now. Instead, it has been suggested that the
spin-induced precession of a disk surrounding a slowly rotating black hole
could have the right period to account for this behavior. In this paper, we
examine how Sagittarius A*'s light curve could be modulated by this mechanism.
We demonstrate that the partial occultation of a nonthermal halo by a compact,
radio-opaque disk does indeed produce the observed frequency-dependent
amplitude. This appears to be in line with other observational arguments
suggesting that Sagittarius A*'s mm/sub-mm spectrum is produced by a ~10
Schwarzschild-radius disk, whereas its cm-waves originate from a nonthermal
particle distribution in a halo extending out to over 20 Schwarzschild radii.
Interestingly, this model suggests that the observed period corresponds to half
the precession period and that a non-axisymmetric disk could produce a second
period roughly twice as long as the first.",2005-05-17T20:56:32Z
Neutrino Absorption: In the magnetic field of GRB In the Fireball Model,"TeV or Super TeV neutrinos are expected to originate at the Gamma ray burster
(GRB) events in the universe. These neutrinos are expected to be produced from
the photo-meson interaction of the protons in the GRB environment. In the usual
picture, the protons in the GRB fireball undergo Fermi acceleration in the
ambient magnetic field of the GRB to very high energy. These protons then
interact with the MeV, KeV or meV photons and produce Delta particles, those
subsequently decay to produce very high energy neutrinos. In this note we focus
on the 100 TeV neutrinos produced in a GRB in the fireball model. We try to
estimate the production point of these multi TeV neutrinos from the center. The
strength of the Magnetic field there. Lastly but importantly modification in

strength of the ambient magnetic field may change the neutrino spectrum.",2005-03-01T08:21:48Z
The effect of neutrinos on the initial fireballs in gamma-ray bursts,"We investigate the fate of very compact, sudden energy depositions that may
lie at the origin of gamma-ray bursts. Following on from the work of Cavallo
and Rees (1978), we take account of the much higher energies now believed to be
involved. The main effect of this is that thermal neutrinos are present and
energetically important. We show that these may provide sufficient cooling to
tap most of the explosion energy. However, at the extreme energies usually
invoked for gamma-ray bursts, the neutrino opacity suffices to prevent dramatic
losses, provided that the heating process is sufficiently fast. In a generic
case, a few tens of percent of the initial fireball energy will escape as an
isotropic millisecond burst of thermal neutrinos with a temperature of about 60
MeV, which is detectable for nearby gamma-ray bursts and hypernovae. For
parameters we find most likely for gamma-ray burst fireballs, the dominant
processes are purely leptonic, and thus the baryon loading of the fireball does
not affect our conclusions.",2005-05-26T12:28:13Z
Cosmological Constraints on a Power Law Universe,"Linearly coasting cosmology is comfortably concordant with a host of
cosmological observations. It is surprisingly an excellent fit to SNe Ia
observations and constraints arising from age of old quasars. In this article
we highlight the overall viability of an open linear coasting cosmological
model.The model is consistent with the latest SNe Ia ``gold'' sample and
accommodates a very old high-redshift quasar, which the standard cold-dark
model fails to do.",2005-06-11T12:52:56Z
Finding the Electromagnetic Counterparts of Cosmological Standard Sirens,"The gravitational waves (GW) emitted during the coalescence of supermassive
black holes (SMBHs) in the mass range 10^4-10^7 M_sun will be detectable out to
high redshifts with LISA. We calculate the size and orientation of the
three-dimensional error ellipse in solid angle and redshift within which the
LISA event could be localized using the GW signatures alone. We take into
account uncertainties in LISA's measurements of the luminosity distance and
direction to the source, in the background cosmology, in weak gravitational
lensing magnification due to inhomogeneities along the line of sight, and
potential source peculiar velocities. We find that weak lensing errors exceed
other sources of uncertainties by nearly an order of magnitude. Under the
plausible assumption that BH mergers are accompanied by gas accretion leading
to Eddington-limited quasar activity, we then compute the number of quasars
that would be found in a typical LISA error volume, as a function of BH mass
and redshift. We find that low redshifts offer the best opportunities to
identify quasar counterparts to cosmological standard sirens, and that the LISA
error volume will typically contain a single near-Eddington quasar at z=1. This
will allow a straightforward test of the hypothesis that BH mergers are
accompanied by bright quasar activity and, if the hypothesis proves correct,
will guarantee the identification of a unique quasar counterpart. This would
yield unprecedented tests of the physics of SMBH accretion, and offer an
alternative method to precisely constrain cosmological parameters [abridged].",2005-05-19T15:07:15Z
Radiation transport in diffractive media,"We consider radiation transport theory applied to non-dispersive but
refractive media. This setting is used to discuss Minkowski's and Abraham's
electromagnetic momentum, and to derive conservation equations independent of
the choice of momentum definition. Using general relativistic kinetic theory,
we derive and discuss a radiation gas energy-momentum conservation equation
valid in arbitrary curved spacetime with diffractive media.",2005-03-21T20:36:03Z
"A near-infrared and optical photometric study of the Sculptor dwarf
  spheroidal galaxy: implications for the metallicity spread","We present here a detailed study of the Sculptor dSph galaxy red giant branch
(RGB) and horizontal branch (HB) morphology, combining new near-infrared
photometry from CIRSI, with optical data from the ESO WFI. For a Sculptor-like
old and generally metal-poor system, the position of RGB stars on the
colour-magnitude diagram is mainly metallicity dependent. The advantage of
using optical-NIR colours is that the position of the RGB locus is much more
sensitive to metallicity than with optical colours alone. In contrast the
horizontal branch (HB) morphology is strongly dependent on both metallicity and
age. Therefore a detailed study of both the RGB in optical-NIR colours and the
HB can help break the age-metallicity degeneracy. Our measured photometric
width of the Sculptor giant branch corresponds to a range in metallicity of
0.75 dex. We detect the RGB and AGB bumps in both the NIR and optical
luminosity functions, and derive from them a mean metallicity of [M/H] = -1.3
+/- 0.1. From isochrone fitting we derive a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.42
with a dispersion of 0.2 dex. These photometric estimators are for the first
time consistent with individual metallicity measurements derived from
spectroscopic observations. No spatial gradient is detected in the RGB
morphology within a radius of 13 arcmin, twice the core radius. On the other
hand, a significant gradient is observed in the HB morphology index, confirming
the `second parameter problem' present in this galaxy. These observations are
consistent with an early extended period of star formation continuing in time
for a few Gyr. (Abridged)",2005-02-24T15:00:40Z
"The Classical and Quantum Inflaton: the Precise Inflationary Potential
  and Quantum Inflaton Decay after WMAP","We clarify classical inflaton models by considering them as effective field
theories `a la Ginzburg-Landau. In this approach, the WMAP statement excluding
the pure phi^4 potential implies the presence of an inflaton mass term at the
scale m ~ 10^{13}GeV.Chaotic, new and hybrid inflation models are studied in an
unified manner.In all cases the inflaton potential takes the form V(phi)=m^2
M_{Pl}^2 v(phi/M_{Pl}), where all coefficients in v(varphi) are of order one.If
such potential corresponds to supersymmetry breaking, the susy scale is sqrt{m
M_{Pl}}~10^{16}GeV which coincides with the GUT scale. For red tilted spectrum
new inflation turns to be favoured while for blue tilted spectrum, hybrid
inflation turns to be the best choice.In both cases, we find an analytic
formula relating the inflaton mass with r (tensor/scalar ratio) and the scalar
spectral index ns: 10^6 m/M_{Pl} = 127 sqrt{r|1-n_s|} where the numerical
coefficient follows from the WMAP amplitude. We review quantum phenomena during
inflation which contribute to relevant observables in the CMB anisotropies and
polarization and we focus on inflaton decay.The deviation from the scale
invariant power spectrum is measured by a small parameter Delta.Delta regulates
the infrared divergences too.In slow roll inflation, Delta is a simple function
of the slow roll parameters. The quantum fluctuations can selfdecay in the
inflationary expansion through processes forbidden in Minkowski. We compute the
self-decay of the inflaton quantum fluctuations during slow roll:superhorizon
fluctuations decay as eta^{Gamma} in conformal time where the new scaling
dimension Gamma is expressed in terms of the amplitude, n_s and r. we discuss
the implications for scalar and tensor perturbations as well as for non
gaussianities.",2005-03-06T17:49:26Z
On the distribution of collisionless particles in local potential well,"The distribution of collisionless particles with infinite motion in the
presence of a local potential well is discussed. Such distribution is important
for interpretation of results of dark matter searches. The relationship
n/v=const, where n and v are respectively number density and velocity of
particles, is derived for particles crossing a local potential well. The limits
of application of this relationship are specified.",2005-04-08T21:51:12Z
The Spatial Orientation of Planetary Nebulae Within the Milky Way,"We analyze the spatial orientation of a homogenous sample of 440 elongated
Planetary Nebulae (PNe) in order to determine the orientation of their apparent
major axis respect to the Milky Way plane. We present some important
geometrical and statistical considerations that have been overlooked by the
previous works on the subject. The global distribution of galactic position
angles (GPA) of PNe is quantitatively not very different from a random
distribution of orientations in the Galaxy. Nevertheless we find that there is
at least one region on the sky, toward the galactic center, where a weak
correlation may exist between the orientation of the major axis of some PNe and
the Galactic equator, with an excess of axes with GPA$\sim 100^{\circ}$.
Therefore, we confirm that ``extrinsic'' phenomena (i.e., global galactic
magnetic fields, shell compression from motion relative to the Interstellar
Medium) do not determine the morphology of PNe on most of the sky, with a
possible exception towards the galactic center.",2005-05-05T11:17:24Z
"The masses, radii and luminosities of the components of U Geminorum","We present a phase-resolved spectroscopic study of the secondary star in the
cataclysmic variable U Gem. We use our data to measure the radial velocity
semi-amplitude, systemic velocity and rotational velocity of the secondary
star. Combining this with literature data allows us to determine masses and
radii for both the secondary star and white dwarf which are independent of any
assumptions about their structure. We use these to compare their properties
with those of field stars and find that both components follow field
mass-radius relationships. The secondary star has the mass, radius, luminosity
and photometric temperature of an M2 star, but a spectroscopic temperature of
M4. The latter may well be due to a high metallicity. There is a troubling
inconsistency between the radius of the white dwarf inferred from its
gravitational redshift and inclination and that inferred from its temperature,
flux, and astrometric distance.
  We find that there are two fundamental limits to the accuracy of the
parameters we can derive. First the radial velocity curve of the secondary star
deviates from a sinusoid, in part because of its asphericity (which can be
modelled) and in part because the line flux is not evenly distributed over its
surface. Second we cannot be certain which spectral type is the best match for
the lines of the secondary star, and the derived rotational velocity is a
function of the spectral type of the template star used.",2005-06-15T17:14:30Z
"Jet Formation in Black Hole Accretion Systems I: Theoretical Unification
  Model","Two types of relativistic jets are suggested to form near accreting black
holes: a potentially ultrarelativistic Poynting-dominated jet and a
Poynting-baryon jet. One source of jet matter is electron-positron pair
production, which is driven by neutrino annihilation in GRBs and photon
annihilation in AGN and x-ray binaries. GRB Poynting-dominated jets are also
loaded by electron-proton pairs by the collisional cascade of Fick-diffused
free neutrons. We show that, for the collapsar model, the neutrino-driven
enthalpy flux (classic fireball model) is probably dominated by the
Blandford-Znajek energy flux, which predicts a jet Lorentz factor of
$\Gamma\sim 100-1000$. We show that radiatively inefficient AGN, such as M87,
are synchrotron-cooling limited to $\Gamma\sim 2-10$. Radiatively efficient
x-ray binaries, such as GRS1915+105, are Compton-drag limited to $\Gamma
\lesssim 2$, but the jet may be destroyed by Compton drag. However, the
Poynting-baryon jet is a collimated outflow with $\Gamma \sim 1-3$. The jet
from radiatively efficient systems, such as microquasar GRS1915+105, may
instead be a Poynting-baryon jet that is only relativistic when the disk is
geometrically thick. In a companion paper, general relativistic hydromagnetic
simulations of black hole accretion with pair creation are used to simulate jet
formation in GRBs, AGN, and x-ray binaries.",2005-06-16T06:16:33Z
Diverse Albedos of Small Trans-Neptunian Objects,"Discovery of transneptunian object (TNO) satellites and determination of
their orbits has recently enabled estimation of the size and albedo of several
small TNOs, extending the size range of objects having known size and albedo
down into the sub-100 km range. In this paper we compute albedo and size
estimates or limits for 20 TNOs, using a consistent method for all binary
objects and a consistent method for all objects having reported thermal fluxes.
As is true for larger TNOs, the small objects show a remarkable diversity of
albedos. Although the sample is limited, there do not yet appear to be any
trends relating albedo to other observable properties or to dynamical class,
with the possible exception of inclination. The observed albedo diversity of
TNOs has important implications for computing the size-frequency distribution,
the mass, and other global properties of the Kuiper belt derived from
observations of objects' apparent magnitudes and may also point the way toward
an improved compositional taxonomy based on albedo in addition to color.",2005-02-10T22:54:44Z
"A VLT study of metal-rich extragalactic H II regions. I. Observations
  and empirical abundances","We have obtained spectroscopic observations from 3600 Angstrom to 9200
Angstrom with FORS at the Very Large Telescope for approximately 70 H II
regions located in the spiral galaxies NGC 1232, NGC 1365, NGC 2903, NGC 2997
and NGC 5236. These data are part of a project aiming at measuring the chemical
abundances and characterizing the massive stellar content of metal-rich
extragalactic H II regions. In this paper we describe our dataset, and present
emission line fluxes for the whole sample. In 32 H II regions we measure at
least one of the following auroral lines: [S II]4072, [N II]5755, [S III]6312
and [O II]7325. From these we derive electron temperatures, as well as oxygen,
nitrogen and sulphur abundances, using classical empirical methods (both
so-called ""Te-based methods"" and ""strong line methods""). Under the assumption
that the temperature gradient does not introduce severe biases, we find that
the most metal-rich nebulae with detected auroral lines are found at
12+log(O/H)~8.9, i.e. about 60% larger than the adopted solar value. However,
classical abundance determinations in metal-rich H II regions may be severely
biased and must be tested with realistic photoionization models. The
spectroscopic observations presented in this paper will serve as a homogeneous
and high-quality database for such purpose.",2005-06-03T20:22:06Z
"An Infalling Torus of Molecular Gas Around the Ultra-Compact HII Region
  G28.20-0.05","We present new observations of the ultra-compact HII region G28.20-0.05 in 23
GHz continuum, and the NH3(1,1), NH3(2.2), and NH3(3,3) lines. To explain the
complicated kinematics of the molecular gas, we propose a model consisting of
two components. One component is an infalling, equatorial torus of molecular
gas, whose dense central region has been ionized to form the ultra-compact HII
region. The second component is a larger expanding molecular shell driven by
some type of wide-angle outflow or wind. We estimate that the infall component
includes more than 18 Msun of molecular gas. We calculate the central mass to
be 79 Msun, probably comprising more than one star. The arrangement of the
molecular material suggests a connection to the other disk-like structures seen
around massive young stars. The central star in this case is more massive, and
the whole region may be more evolved than other similar objects such as IRAS
20126+4104, IRAS 18089-1732, G192.16-3.84, and AFGL5142.",2005-06-02T14:32:25Z
"The T Tauri Phase Down to Nearly Planetary Masses: Echelle Spectra of 82
  Very Low Mass Stars and Brown Dwarfs","Using the largest high-resolution spectroscopic sample to date of young, very
low mass stars (VLMS) and brown dwarfs (BDs), we investigate disk accretion in
objects ranging from just above the hydrogen-burning limit all the way to
nearly planetary masses. Our 82 targets span spectral types from M5 to M9.5, or
masses from 0.15 Msun down to ~15 Jupiters. They are confirmed members of the
rho Oph, Taurus, Cha I, IC 348, R CrA, Upper Sco and TW Hydrae regions, with
ages <1 to ~10 Myr. The sample contains 41 BDs (spectral types >= M6.5). We
find that: (1) classical T Tauri-like disk-accretion persists in the BD domain
down to nearly the deuterium-burning limit; (2) in addition to H-alpha,
permitted emission lines of CaII, OI and HeI are also good accretion
indicators, as in CTTs; (3) the CaII 8662A flux is an excellent quantitative
measure of the accretion rate (Mdot) in VLMS and BDs(as in CTTs); (4) Mdot
diminishes as M^2 -- our measurements support previous findings of this
correlation, and extend it to the entire range of sub-stellar masses; (5) the
accretor fraction among VLMS and BDs decreases substantially with age, as in
higher-mass stars; (6) at any given age, the VLMS and BD accretor fraction is
comparable to that in higher-mass stars; and (7) a number of sources with IR
disk excesses do not evince measurable accretion, with the incidence of such a
mismatch increasing with age: this implies that disks in the low mass regime
can persist beyond the main accretion phase, and parallels the transition from
the classical to post-T Tauri stage in more massive stars. These strong
similarities at young ages, between higher-mass stars and low-mass bodies close
to and below the hydrogen-burning limit, are consistent with a common formation
mechanism in the two mass regimes. (abridged)",2005-02-08T10:00:06Z
"Spectrum of Very High Energy Gamma-Rays from the blazar 1ES1959+650
  during Flaring Activity in 2002","The blazar 1ES 1959+650 was observed in a flaring state with the Whipple 10 m
Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope during May of 2002. A spectral analysis
has been carried out on the data from that time period and the resulting very
high energy gamma-ray spectrum ($E \geq 316$ GeV) can be well fit by a
power-law of differential spectral index \alpha = 2.78 +/- 0.12_{stat.} +/-
0.21_{sys.}. On June 4th 2002, the source flared dramatically in the gamma-ray
range without any coincident increase in the X-ray emission, providing the
first unambiguous example of an `orphan' gamma-ray flare from a blazar. The
gamma-ray spectrum for these data can also be described by a simple power-law
fit with \alpha = 2.82 +/- 0.15_{stat.} +/- 0.30_{sys.}. There is no compelling
evidence for spectral variability, or for any cut-off to the spectrum.",2005-03-03T19:55:27Z

"The Assembly History of Field Spheroidals: Evolution of Mass-to-light
  Ratios and Signatures of Recent Star Formation","We present a comprehensive catalog of high signal-to-noise spectra obtained
with the DEIMOS spectrograph on the Keck II telescope for a sample of
F850LP<22.43 (AB) field spheroidal (E+S0s; 163) and bulge dominated disk (61)
galaxies in the redshift range 0.2<z<1.2. We examine the zero point, tilt and
scatter of the Fundamental Plane (FP) as a function of redshift and
morphological properties, carefully accounting for luminosity-dependent biases
via Montecarlo simulations. The evolution of the overall FP can be represented
by a mean change in effective mass-to-light ratio given by <d \log (M/L_{\rm
B})/dz>=-0.72^{+0.07}_{-0.05}\pm0.04. However, this evolution depends
significantly on the dynamical mass, being slower for larger masses as reported
in a previous letter. In addition, we separately show the intrinsic scatter of
the FP increases with redshift as d(rms(M/L_{\rm B}))/dz=0.040\pm0.015.
Although these trends are consistent with single burst populations which formed
at $z_f>2$ for high mass spheroidals and z_{f}~1.2 for lower mass systems, a
more realistic picture is that most of the stellar mass formed in all systems
at z>2 with subsequent activity continuing to lower redshifts (z<1.2). The
fraction of stellar mass formed at recent times depend strongly on galactic
mass, ranging from <1% for masses above 10^{11.5} M_{\odot} to 20-40% below
10^{11} M_{\odot}. Independent support for recent activity is provided by
spectroscopic ([\ion{O}{2}] emission, H\delta) and photometric (blue cores and
broad-band colors) diagnostics. Via the analysis of a large sample with many
independent diagnostics, we are able to reconcile previously disparate
interpretations of the assembly history of field spheroidals. [Abridged]",2005-03-07T21:22:28Z
"Exploring the Geometry, Topology and Morphology of Large Scale Structure
  using Minkowski Functionals","Modern redshift surveys such as the 2 degree field Galaxy Redshift Survey
(2dFGRS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) reveal the fully 3 dimensional
distribution of a million or so galaxies over a large cosmological volume.
Visually galaxies appear to be distributed along sheet-like and/or filamentary
superclusters. The CfA Great Wall, Southern Great Wall and the recently
discovered SDSS Great Wall are very spectacular superclusters. Clearly
theoretical predictions for galaxy clustering must be tested against these rich
datasets. This can be achieved by means of the Minkowski Functionals (MFs). A
MF-based approach provides an excellent description of superclusters and voids
and allows one to quantify the properties of the cosmic web. In this review we
give a summary of the progress made in this direction. After reviewing the
status of observations and of numerical simulations, we comment upon the nature
of bias which serves as a link between theoretical predictions and
observations. We also summarise the methods developed for efficient numerical
estimation of MFs for cosmological datasets and list several important results
obtained using these methods. Specifically, we stress the discriminatory power
of MFs and of the derived morphological statistics, the Shapefinders.
Shapefinders are an excellent tool with which to study the shapes and sizes of
superclusters and voids. We also discuss some of the important effects of
scale-dependent bias which are brought out by a MF-based study of the mock
catalogues of galaxies. Such effects, we note, should be accounted for before
comparing theoretical models with observations.",2005-02-04T16:07:34Z
A Multi-wavelength Study of the X-ray Sources in NGC 5018,"The E3 giant elliptical galaxy NGC5018 was observed with the Chandra X-ray
Observatory on 14 April 2001. Results of analysis of these X-ray data as well
as of complementary optical, infrared, and radio data are reported. Seven X-ray
point sources, including the nucleus, were detected.If they are intrinsic to
NGC5018, then all six non-nuclear sources have luminosities exceeding E+39
ergs/s in the 0.5-8.0 keV energy band; placing them in the class of
Ultra-luminous X-ray sources. Comparison of X-ray source positions to archival
HST/WFPC2 images reveal four of the six non-nuclear sources are
spatially-coincident with bright, absolute-magnitude (V) around -8.6 mag,
objects. These four objects have optical magnitudes and (V-I) colors consistent
with globular clusters in NGC5018 but they also have X-ray-to-optical flux
ratios consistent with background active galactic nuclei. Strong, unpolarized,
radio emission has been detected from one of the optically-bright counterparts.
Another optically-bright counterpart was observed to vary by one mag in optical
observations taken 28 July 1997 and 04 Feb 1999. Extended X-ray emission is
detected within a 15""radius of the galaxy center at a luminosity of E+40 ergs/s
in the X-ray band. Its thermal X-ray spectrum (kT around 0.4 keV) and its
spatial coincidence with strong H_alpha emission are consistent with a hot gas
origin. The nucleus itself may be a weak X-ray source, around E+39 ergs/s, that
displays a radio spectrum typical of AGN.",2005-02-04T22:49:47Z
"Consequences of Disk Scale Height on LISA Confusion Noise from Close
  White Dwarf Binaries","Gravitational radiation from the Galactic population of close white dwarf
binaries (CWDBs) is expected to produce a confusion-limited signal at the lower
end of the sensitivity band of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).
The canonical scale height of the disk population has been taken to be 90 pc
for most studies of the nature of this confusion-limited signal. This estimate
is probably too low, and the consequences of a more realistic scale height are
investigated with a model of the LISA signal due to populations of close white
dwarf binaries with different scale heights. If the local space density of
CWDBs is held constant, increasing the scale height results in both an increase
in the overall strength of the confusion-limited signal as well as in increase
in the frequency at which the signals become individually resolvable. If the
total number of binaries is held constant, increasing the scale height results
in a reduction of the number of expected bright signals above the
confusion-limited signal at low frequencies. We introduce an estimator for
comparing this transition frequency that takes into account the signal
spreading at higher frequencies.",2005-04-06T03:45:41Z
Kaluza-Klein Dark Matter and Galactic Antiprotons,"Extra dimensions offer new ways to address long-standing problems in beyond
the standard model particle physics. In some classes of extra-dimensional

In this work, we study indirect detection of Kaluza-Klein dark matter via its
annihilation into antiprotons. We use a sophisticated galactic cosmic ray
diffusion model whose parameters are fully constrained by an extensive set of
experimental data. We discuss how fluxes of cosmic antiprotons can be used to
exclude low Kaluza-Klein masses.",2005-06-16T16:14:37Z
Tuning into UHE Neutrinos in Antarctica - The ANITA Experiment,"The Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) experiment is being
developed to search for ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrino interactions
($>3\times10^{18}$ eV) in the Antarctic ice cap. A neutrino interaction in the
ice will produce a radio pulse by the means of the Askaryan effect. The large
radio transparency of ice allows for such a pulse to be recorded by a cluster
of balloon-borne antennas. The details of the ANITA instrument, now in a
construction phase, and the science we hope to achieve is discussed. In order
to prepare for the main mission, we have flown ANITA-lite during the 2003/04
austral season. ANITA-lite consisted of two quad-ridge horn antennas and a
prototype RF (radio frequency) triggering and recording system. Here we present
the results of an impulsive RF background survey of Antarctica, as well as
proof-of-principle gain, tracking, and timing calibrations conducted by
observing solar radio emissions and calibration radio-pulses. A preliminary UHE

The Low-Redshift Lyman Alpha Forest toward PKS 0405-123,"We present STIS 7km/s resolution data of the Ly-a forest toward PKS0405-123
(z=0.574). We make two samples. The strong sample (60 systems) has column
density logNHI>13.3 over 0.002<z<0.423, and the weak sample (44) has
logNHI>13.1 at 0.020<z<0.234; 7 absorbers show metals, all with OVI, but often
offset in velocity from HI. The strong sample Doppler parameters show
<b>=47+-22km/s; for the weak, <b>=44+-21km/s. Line blending and s/n effects
likely inflate b. The redshift density dN/dz is consistent with previous, lower
resolution results for logNHI>14.0. For 13.1<logNHI<14.0, we find a dN/dz
overdensity of ~0.2-0.3 dex at 0.127<z<0.234, which we believe arises from
cosmic variance. We find Ly-a clustering over Delta v<250km/s for logNHI>13.3,
consistent with a numerical model. There is a void in the strong sample at
0.0320<z<0.0814. We detect radial velocity correlations for Delta v<250km/s
between Ly-a absorbers and 39 galaxies in a 10' field. The correlation grows
with minimum NHI, peaking for logNHI ~> 13.5-14.0. The strength is similar to
that of the galaxy-galaxy correlation for our sample, implying that such Ly-a
systems have mass log M/Msun= 11.3+1.0-0.6. Including lower column density
systems in the sample shows correlations only out to Delta v <125km/s, as would
be expected for smaller density perturbations. Galaxy counts and local HI
column density appear correlated, peaking at ~5000km/s. We also give column
densities for Galactic species. (Abridged)",2005-05-29T21:40:21Z
Modelling the UV to sub-mm SED of Starburst Galaxies,"This paper reviews the theoretical modelling of starburst galaxies with
particular emphasis on the importance of the gas-phase physics in determining
the form of the continuum SED and the emission line spectrum. Both line and

the aim of decreasing the errors associated with measuring the star formation

H_2 Pure Rotational Lines in the Orion Bar,"Using the Texas Echelon Cross Echelle Spectrograph (TEXES) we mapped emission
in the H_2 v = 0-0 S(1) and S(2) lines toward the Orion Bar PDR at 2""
resolution. We also observed H_2 v = 0-0 S(4) at selected points toward the
front of the PDR. Our maps cover a 12"" by 40"" region of the bar where H_2
ro-vibrational lines are bright. The distributions of H_2 0-0 S(1), 0-0 S(2),
and 1-0 S(1) line emission agree in remarkable detail.
  The high spatial resolution (0.002 pc) of our observations allows us to probe
the distribution of warm gas in the Orion Bar to a distance approaching the
scale length for FUV photon absorption. We use these new observational results
to set parameters for the PDR models described in a companion paper (Draine et
al. 2005, in prep). The best-fit model can account for the separation of the
H_2 emission from the ionization front and the intensities of the ground state
rotational lines as well as the 1-0 S(1) and 2-1 S(1) lines. This model
requires significant adjustments to the commonly used values for the dust UV
attenuation cross section and the photoelectric heating rate.",2005-05-31T22:46:19Z
Discovery of VHE Gamma Rays from PKS 2005-489,"The high-frequency peaked BL Lac PKS 2005-489 (z=0.071) was observed in 2003
and 2004 with the H.E.S.S. stereoscopic array of imaging atmospheric-Cherenkov
telescopes in Namibia. A signal was detected at the 6.7 sigma level in the 2004
observations (24.2 hrs live time), but not in the 2003 data set (27.3 hrs live
time). PKS 2005-489 is the first blazar independently discovered by H.E.S.S. to
be an emitter of VHE photons, and only the second such blazar in the Southern
Hemisphere. The integral flux above 200 GeV observed in 2004 is (6.9 +/- 1.0
+/- 1.4) x 10$^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, corresponding to ~2.5% of the flux
observed from the Crab Nebula. The 99% upper limit on the flux in 2003, I(>200
GeV) < 5.2 x 10$^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, is smaller than the flux measured
in 2004, suggesting an increased level of activity in 2004. However, the data
show no evidence for significant variability on any time scale less than a
year. An energy spectrum is measured and is characterized by a very soft power
law (photon index = 4.0 +/- 0.4).",2005-04-23T15:14:27Z
HII and H2 in the envelopes of cooling flow central galaxies,"We report observations of ionized and warm molecular gas in the extended
regions of the central galaxies in several cooling flow clusters. These show
that both gas phases are present in these clusters to large radii. We trace
both Pa alpha and H2 lines to radii in excess of 20 kpc. The surface brightness
profiles of the two phases trace each other closely. Apart from very close to
the central AGN, line ratios in and between the phases vary only slowly with
position. The kinematics of the phases are indistinguishable and away from the
influence of the central AGN both the mean and dispersion in velocity are low
(<= 100 km/s) ruling out kinematic support of the molecular gas. All of the
above indicates that the mechanisms for heating the molecular gas and ionizing
the HII regions are highly coupled. The highest surface brightness emission
within a few kpc of the central AGN is distinct, both kinematically and
thermally from that at larger radii. The relative strengths of the Pa alpha to
the H2 lines indicates a source of UV excitation rich in EUV relative to FUV
photons, e.g. a black body with a temperature >= 10^5 K.",2005-04-19T13:56:27Z
"An abrupt drop in the coherence of the lower kilohertz QPO in 4U
  1636-536","Using archival data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), we study in
a systematic way the variation of the quality factor and amplitude of the lower
and upper kHz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) in the low-mass X-ray binary
4U1636-536, over a frequency range from ~550 Hz to ~1200 Hz. When represented
in a quality factor versus frequency diagram, the upper and lower QPOs follow
two different tracks, suggesting that they are distinct phenomena, although not
completely independent because the frequency difference of the two QPOs, when
detected simultaneously, remains within ~60 Hz of half the neutron star spin
frequency (at 581 Hz). The quality factor of the lower kHz QPO increases with
frequency up to a maximum of ~200 at ~850 Hz, then drops precipitously to Q~50
at the highest detected frequencies ~920 Hz. A ceiling of the lower QPO
frequencies at 920 Hz is also clearly seen in a frequency versus count rate
diagram.
  The quality factor provides a measure of the coherence of the underlying
oscillator. For exponentially damped sinusoidal shots, the highest Q observed
corresponds to an oscillator coherence time of ~ 0.1 seconds. All existing QPO
models face challenges in explaining such a long coherence time and the
significantly different behaviours of the quality factors of the upper and
lower QPOs reported here. It is therefore difficult to be certain of the
implications of the abrupt change in the lower QPO at ~850 Hz. We discuss
various possible causes, including that the drop in coherence is ultimately
caused by effects related to the innermost stable circular orbit (abridged).",2005-05-19T11:40:12Z
Probing the precession of the inner accretion disk in Cygnus X-1,"We show that changes in the orientation of the inner accretion disk of Cygnus
X-1 affect the shape of the broad Fe K$\alpha$ emission line emitted from this
object, in such a way that eV-level spectral resolution observations (such as
those that will be carried out by the {\it ASTRO-E2} satellite) can be used to
analyze the dynamics of the disk. We here present a potential diagnostic tool,
supported by numerical simulations, by which a few observations of Cygnus X-1,
separated in time, can determine whether its accretion disk actually precesses,
and if so, determine its period and precession angle. This approach could also
be used for similar studies in other microquasar systems.",2005-03-08T19:05:56Z
"An analytical description of the disruption of star clusters in tidal
  fields with an application to Galactic open clusters","We present a simple analytical description of the disruption of star clusters
in a tidal field, which agrees excellently with detailed N-body simulations.
The analytic expression can be used to predict the mass and age histograms of
surviving clusters for any cluster initial mass function and any cluster
formation history. The method is applied to open clusters in the solar
neighbourhood, based on the new cluster sample of Kharchenko et al. From a
comparison between the observed and predicted age distributions in the age
range between 10 Myr to 3 Gyr we find the following results: (1) The disruption
time of a 10^4 M_sun cluster in the solar neighbourhood is about 1.3+/-0.5 Gyr.
This is a factor 5 shorter than derived from N-body simulations of clusters in
the tidal field of the galaxy. (2) The present starformation rate in bound
clusters within 600 pc from the Sun is 5.9+/-0.8 * 10^2 M_sun / Myr, which
corresponds to a surface star formation rate in bound clusters of 5.2+/-0.7
10^(-10) M_sun/yr/pc^2. (3) The age distribution of open clusters shows a bump
between 0.26 and 0.6 Gyr when the cluster formation rate was 2.5 times higher
than before and after. (4) The present star formation rate in bound clusters is
half as small as that derived from the study of embedded clusters. The
difference suggests that half of the clusters in the solar neighbourhood become
unbound within 10 Myr. (5) The most massive clusters within 600 pc had an
initial mass of 3*10^4 M_sun. This is in agreement with the statistically
expected value based on a cluster initial mass function with a slope of -2,
even if the physical upper mass limit is as high as 10^6 M_sun.",2005-05-27T15:20:16Z
The Nature of Nonthermal X-ray Filaments Near the Galactic Center,"Recent Chandra and XMM-{\it Newton} observations reported evidence of two
X-ray filaments G359.88-0.08 (SgrA-E) and G359.54+0.18 (the ripple filament)
near the Galactic center. The X-ray emission from these filaments has a
nonthermal spectrum and coincides with synchrotron emitting radio sources.
Here, we report the detection of a new X-ray feature coincident with a radio
filament G359.90-0.06 (SgrA-F) and show more detailed VLA, Chandra and BIMA
observations of the radio and X-ray filaments. In particular, we show that
radio emission from the nonthermal filaments G359.90-0.06 (SgrA-F) and
G359.54+0.18 (the ripple) has a steep spectrum whereas G359.88-0.08 (SgrA-E)
has a flat spectrum. The X-ray emission from both these sources could be due to
synchrotron radiation. However, given that the 20 \kms molecular cloud, with
its intense 1.2mm dust emission, lies in the vicinity of SgrA-F, it is possible
that the X-rays could be produced by inverse Compton scattering of far-infrared
photons from dust by the relativistic electrons responsible for the radio
synchrotron emission. The production of X-ray emission from ICS allows an
estimate of the magnetic field strength of ~0.08 mG within the nonthermal
filament. This should be an important parameter for any models of the Galactic
center nonthermal filaments.",2005-02-14T05:23:27Z
"Gamma-Rays from Large Scale Structure Formation and the Warm-Hot
  Intergalactic Medium: Cosmic Baryometry with Gamma-Rays","It is shown that inverse Compton gamma-rays from electrons accelerated in
large scale structure formation shocks can be crucially affected by
non-gravitational effects such as radiative cooling and galaxy formation, with
corresponding uncertainties by an order of magnitude in either the gamma-ray
source counts or the extragalactic background contribution. However, this also
implies that such gamma-rays may in the near future provide us with valuable
information about the fraction of cosmic baryons in different forms,
particularly the warm-hot intergalactic medium where the majority of the
baryons in the universe are believed to reside. We address this problem in a
simple way through semi-analytic modeling of structure formation shocks which
self-consistently treats merger and accretion shocks.",2005-02-17T14:35:08Z
Low-Mass Runaway Stars from the Orion Trapezium Cluster,"In the course of a search for common proper motion binaries, in the Jones &
Walker (JW) catalogue of proper motions in the Orion Nebula Cluster, we came
across several faint stars with proper motions larger than one arcsecond per
century and probabilities of membership P larger than 0.90. Such stars are
interesting because they could be low-mass runaway stars recently accelerated
by n-body interactions in compact multiple systems. Of particular interest
among these stars is JW 451, which has a P = 0.98, the largest transverse
velocity among all the stars with P larger or equal than 0.5 (69 km/s), and a
proper motion vector which suggests that it was accelerated by the component C
of the Trapezium some 1000 years ago. A closer examination of those JW stars
with proper motion larger than one arcsec per century revealed that two other
stars, JW 349 and JW 355 (with transverse velocities of 38 and 90 km/s
respectively), in spite of being listed with P = 0 by JW, should also be
considered part of the cluster, because these objects are also externally
ionized proplyds. In fact, Hillenbrand (1997) assigns to them probabilities of
membership of 0.99. Moreover, the proper motion errors of these two stars are
relatively small, and so they are good candidates to be runaway stars recently
accelerated in the Orion Nebula Cluster.",2005-05-31T22:17:03Z
Globally integrated measurements of the Earth's visible spectral albedo,"We report spectroscopic observations of the earthshine reflected from the
Moon. By applying our photometry methodology to spectroscopy, we were able to
precisely determine the Earth's reflectance, and its variation as a function of
wavelength through a single night as the Earth rotates. These data imply that
planned regular monitoring of earthshine spectra will yield valuable, new
inputs for climate models, which would be complementary to those from the more
standard broadband measurements of satellite platforms. The mean spectroscopic
albedo over the visible is consistent with simultaneous broadband photometric
measurements. We found no evidence for an appreciable ""red"" or ""vegetation
edge"" in the Earth's spectral albedo, and no evidence for changes in this
spectral region (700 -740 nm) over the 40 degrees of Earth's rotation covered
by our observations.",2005-05-04T21:12:19Z
"Cluster Baryon Fraction and Structure from the Convergence/SZ Effect
  Diagram","The cross-correlation of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZ) and weak-lensing
imaging surveys can be used to test how well hot baryons trace dark matter in
clusters of galaxies. We examine this concept using mock SZ and weak-lensing
surveys based on the forthcoming AMiBA experiment and generated from a
pre-heated cosmological N-body/hydrodynamic simulation. A cross-correlation
diagram between matched lensing convergence and Compton y maps exhibits
butterfly-wing-like structures, corresponding to individual clusters, that
encode rich information about the distributions of hot gas and dark matter.
When the cluster redshift and temperature are available the slope of a wing
reveals the cluster gas fraction and the width of the wing indicates how badly
the hot gas traces dark matter. On the basis of simulated data we discuss
systematic errors in the projected gas fraction estimates that would be
obtained from such survey comparisons.",2005-06-02T20:01:24Z
Sources of oscillation frequency increase with rising solar activity,"We analyze and interpret SOHO/MDI data on oscillation frequency changes
between 1996 and 2004 focusing on differences between activity minimum and
maximum of solar cycle 23. We study only the behavior of the centroid
frequencies, which reflect changes averaged over spherical surfaces. Both the
f-mode and p-mode frequencies are correlated with general measures of the sun's
magnetic activity. However, the physics behind each of the two correlations is
quite different. We show that for the f-modes the dominant cause of the
frequency increase is the dynamical effect of the rising magnetic field. The
relevant rise must occur in subphotospheric layers reaching to some 0.5 - 0.7
kG at a depth of about 5 Mm. However, the implied constraints also require the
field change in the atmosphere to be so small that it has only a tiny dynamical
effect on p-mode frequencies. For p-modes, the most plausible explanation of
the frequency increase is a less than 2 percent decrease in the radial
component of the turbulent velocity in the outer layers. Lower velocity implies
a lower efficiency of the convective transport, hence lower temperature, which
also contributes to the p-mode frequency increase.",2005-03-11T15:47:52Z
New constraints on MOND from galaxy clusters,"We revisit the application of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) to galaxy
clusters. We confront the high quality X-ray data for eight clusters of
galaxies observed by the \xmm satellite with the predictions of MOND. We obtain
a ratio of the MOND dynamical mass to the baryonic mass of $M_m/M_b=4.94\pm
0.50$ in the outer parts (i.e $r\sim 0.5$ ~ R$_{vir}$), in the concordance
cosmological model where the predicted asymptotic ratio, if any baryons are
present, is $7.7^{+1.4}_{-1.1}$ (at $r\geq 0.3$ ~ R$_{vir}$). We confirm that
the MOND paradigm lowers the discrepancy between the binding mass and the
baryonic mass in clusters by a factor of $\sim 1.6$ at about half the virial
radius. However, at this radius about 80% of the mass is still missing, and as
pointed out by \citet{sanders03}, this necessitates a component of dark baryons
or neutrinos in the cluster core. Concerning the neutrino hypothesis,
application of the new data requires a minimum neutrino mass of $m_\nu>1.74\pm
0.34$ eV to fill this gap. The corresponding 2$\sigma$ lower limit of
$m_\nu>1.06$ eV is marginally inconsistent with the current constraints from
the cluster number counts, and from the CMB and large scale structure data.
MOND must invoke neutrinos to represent the main component that account for the
missing mass problem in clusters.",2005-05-02T10:15:31Z
"The origin of HE0107-5240 and the production of O and Na in extremely
  metal-poor stars","We elaborate the binary scenario for the origin of HE0107-5240, the most
metal-poor star yet observed ([Fe/H] = -5.3), using current knowledge of the
evolution of extremely metal-poor stars. From the observed C/N value, we
estimate the binary separation and period. Nucleosynthesis in a helium
convective zone into which hydrogen has been injected allows us to discuss the
origin of surface O and Na as well as the abundance distribution of s-process
elements. We can explain the observed abundances of 12C, 13C, N, O, and Na and
predict future observations to validate the Pop III nature of HE0107-5240.",2005-04-25T15:27:42Z
Observational Constraints on Pulsar Wind Theories,"Two-dimensional, relativistic, MHD simulations of pulsar-wind powered nebulae
provide strong constraints on the properties of the winds themselves. In
particular, they confirm that Poynting flux must be converted into particle
energy close to or inside the termination shock front, emphasising the puzzle
known as the $\sigma$ paradox. To distinguish between the different possible
resolutions of this paradox, additional observational constraints are required.
In this paper, I briefly discuss two recents developments in this respect: the
modelling of high time-resolution optical polarimetry of the Crab pulsar, and
the detection of the pulsar/Be star binary PSR 1259-63 in TeV energy
gamma-rays.",2005-05-30T09:56:08Z
Optical Properties of 4248 IRAS Galaxies,"We have investigated optical properties of 4248 infrared galaxies (IRGs) by
positionally matching data from the IRAS and the SDSS DR3. Our sample includes
3 hyper luminous infrared galaxies (L >10^13Lsun) and 178 ultra luminous
infrared galaxies (10^12Lsun < L < 10^13Lsun). Our findings are as follows: (i)
more IR luminous galaxies tend to have smaller local galaxy density, being
consistent with the picture where luminous IRGs are created by the
merger-interaction of galaxies that happens more often in lower density
regions; (ii) the fractions of AGNs increase as a function of Lir; (iii) there
is a good correlation between Lir and L[OIII] for AGNs, suggesting both of the
parameters can be a good estimator of the total power of AGNs; (iv) a good
correlation is found between Lir and optically estimated star formation rate
(SFR) for star-forming galaxies, suggesting Lir is a good indicator of galaxy
SFR. However, caution is needed when SFR is estimated using Lir, i.e., high SFR
galaxies selected by Lir is frequently merger/interaction, whereas high SFR
galaxies selected by optical emission is often normal spiral or
Magellanic-cloud like irregular galaxies. (v) more IR luminous galaxies have
slightly larger Halpha/Hbeta ratio; (vi) more IR luminous galaxies have more
centrally-concentrated morphology, being consistent with the morphological
appearance of galaxy-galaxy merger remnants. Optical image of ultra/very
luminous infrared galaxies also show frequent signs of merger/interaction.
(vii) comparison with the SED synthesis models indicate that majority of
luminous infrared galaxies (L > 10^11Lsun) may be in a post-starburst phase,
sharing a similar (but not the same) merger/interaction origin with E+A
galaxies. (abridged)",2005-04-04T20:00:12Z
Dynamics of the Solar Magnetic Network: Two-dimensional MHD Simulations,"The aim of this work is to identify the physical processes that occur in the
network and contribute to its dynamics and heating. We model the network as
consisting of individual flux tubes with a non-potential field structure that
are located in intergranular lanes. With a typical horizontal size of 200 km at
the base of the photosphere, they expand upward and merge with their neighbors
at a height of about 600 km. Above a height of approximately 1000 km the
magnetic field starts to become uniform.
  Waves are generated in this medium by means of motions at the lower boundary.
We focus on transverse driving, which generates both fast and slow waves within
a flux tube and acoustic waves at the interface of the tube and the field-free
medium. The acoustic waves at the interface are due to compression of the gas
on one side of the flux tube and expansion on the other. These waves travel
upward along the two sides of the (2D) flux tube and enter it, where they
become longitudinal waves. For impulsive excitation with a time constant of 120
s, we find that a dominant feature is the creation of vortical motions that
propagate upward. We have identified an efficient mechanism for the generation
of longitudinal waves and shock formation in the chromospheric part of the flux
concentration. We examine some broad implications of our results.",2005-03-24T08:16:57Z
Grain Alignment by Radiation in Dark Clouds and Cores,"We study alignment of grains by radiative torques. We found steep rise of
radiative torque efficiency as grain size increases. This allows larger grains
that are known to exist within molecular clouds to be aligned by the attenuated
and reddened interstellar radiation field. In particular, we found that, even
deep inside giant molecular clouds, e.g. at optical depths corresponding to
less than Av of 10 large grains can still be aligned by radiative torque. This
means that, contrary to earlier claims, far-infrared/submillimeter polarimetry
provides a reliable tool to study magnetic fields of pre-stellar cores. Our
results show that the grain size distribution is important for determining the
relation between the degree of polarization and intensity.",2005-05-28T22:19:10Z
Deconfinement and color superconductivity in cold neutron stars,"We study the deconfinement transition of hadronic matter into quark matter in
neutron star conditions in the light of color superconductivity. Deconfinement
is considered to be a first order phase transition that conserves color and
flavor. It gives a short-lived {($\tau \sim \tau_{weak}$)} transitory
colorless-quark-phase that is {\it not} in $\beta$-equilibrium. We deduce the
equations governing deconfinement when quark pairing is allowed and find the
regions of the parameter space (pairing gap $\Delta$ versus bag constant $B$)
where deconfinement is possible inside cold neutron stars. We show that for a
wide region of ($B,\Delta$) a pairing pattern is reachable within a strong
interaction timescale, and the resulting ``2SC-like'' phase is preferred
energetically to the unpaired phase. We also show that although $\beta$-stable
hybrid star configurations are known to be possible for a wide region of the
($B,\Delta$)-space, many of these configurations could not form in practice
because deconfinement is forbidden, i.e. the here studied non-$\beta$-stable
\emph{intermediate} state cannot be reached.",2005-04-26T01:45:18Z
"Supermassive black hole mass measurements for NGC 1300 and NGC 2748
  based on HST emission-line gas kinematics","We present Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph emission-line spectra of the
central regions of the spiral galaxies NGC 1300 and NGC 2748. From the derived
kinematics of the nuclear gas we have found evidence for central supermassive
black holes in both galaxies. The estimated mass of the black hole in NGC 1300
is 6.6 (+6.3, -3.2) x 10^7 solar masses and in NGC 2748 is 4.4 (+3.5, -3.6) x
10^7 solar masses (both at the 95% confidence level). These two black hole mass
estimates contribute to the poorly sampled low-mass end of the nuclear black
hole mass spectrum.",2005-02-28T13:45:50Z
Tip-tilt Error in Lyot Coronagraphs,"The direct detection of extrasolar planets by imaging means is limited by the
large flux of light from the host star being scattered into the region of
interest by a variety of processes, including diffraction. Coronagraphs are
devices that suppress the undesirable scattering of light caused by
diffraction. In a coronagraph the sensitivity limit for high dynamic range is
limited by the propagation of errors introduced by the imperfect optical system
to the final image. In this paper we develop theory and simulations to
understand how such errors propagate in a coronagraph. We describe the response
of classical and band-limited Lyot coronagraphs to small and large errors in
the placement of the central star, and identify ways of making such
coronagraphs more robust to small guiding errors. We also uncover features of
the decentered PSF that can lead to spurious detection of companions,
especially with aggressive, high dynamic range coronagraphs dedicated to
companion searches aimed at finding extrasolar terrestrial or Jovian planets.",2005-03-30T14:55:43Z
"Modelling of aspherical nebulae. I. A quick pseudo-3D photoionization
  code","We describe a pseudo-3D photoionization code, NEBU_3D and its associated
visualization tool, VIS_NEB3D, which are able to easily and rapidly treat a
wide variety of nebular geometries, by combining models obtained with a 1D
photoionization code. The only requirement for the code to work is that the
ionization source is uniqu e and not extended. It is applicable as long as the
diffuse ionizing radiation f ield is not dominant and strongly inhomogeneous.
As examples of the capabilities of these new tools, we consider two very differ
ent theoretical cases. One is that of a high excitation planetary nebula that
ha s an ellipsoidal shape with two polar density knots. The other one is that
of a blister HII region, for which we have also constructed a spherical model
(the sp herical impostor) which has exactly the same Hbeta surface brightness
distrib ution as the blister model and the same ionizing star. These two
examples warn against preconceived ideas when interpreting spectroscop ic and
imaging data of HII regions and planetary nebulae. The tools NEBU_3D and
VIS_NEB3D, which will be made publicly available in the future, should
facilitat e the performance of numerical experiments, to yield a better
understanding of t he physics of aspherical ionized nebulae.",2005-03-03T17:21:27Z
"Hyperfine splitting of [Al VI]3.66um and the Al isotopic ratio in
  NGC6302","The core of planetary nebula NGC 6302 is filled with high-excitation
photoionised gas at low expansion velocities. It represents a unique
astrophysical situation in which to search for hyperfine structure (HFS) in
coronal emission lines from highly ionised species. HFS is otherwise blended by
thermal or velocity broadening. Spectra containing [AlVI]~3.66um 3P2-3P1,
obtained with Phoenix on Gemini-South at resolving powers of up to 75000,
resolve the line into five hyperfine components separated by 20 to 60km/s due
to the coupling of the I=5/2 nuclear spin of 27Al with the total electronic
angular momentum J. 26Al has a different nuclear spin of I=5, and a different
HFS, which allows us to place a 3sigma upper limit on the 26Al/27Al abundance
ratio of 1/33. We measure the HFS magnetic-dipole coupling constants for
[AlVI], and provide the first estimates of the electric-quadrupole HFS coupling
constants obtained through astronomical observations of an atomic transition.",2005-03-03T16:56:45Z
Detection of Neutrinos from Supernovae in Nearby Galaxies,"While existing detectors would see a burst of many neutrinos from a Milky Way
supernova, the supernova rate is only a few per century. As an alternative, we
propose the detection of ~ 1 neutrino per supernova from galaxies within 10
Mpc, in which there were at least 9 core-collapse supernovae since 2002. With a
future 1-Mton scale detector, this could be a faster method for measuring the
supernova neutrino spectrum, which is essential for calibrating numerical
models and predicting the redshifted diffuse spectrum from distant supernovae.
It would also allow a > 10^4 times more precise trigger time than optical data
alone for high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves.",2005-03-15T18:56:12Z
Testing Stellar Models With An Improved Physical Orbit for 12 Bootis,"We report on a significantly improved determination of the physical orbit of
the double-lined spectroscopic binary system 12 Boo. We have a 12 Boo
interferometry dataset spanning six years with the Palomar Testbed
Interferometer, a smaller amount of data from the Navy Prototype Optical
Interferometer, and a radial velocity dataset spanning 14 years from the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. We have updated the 12 Boo
physical orbit model with our expanded interferometric and radial velocity
datasets. The revised orbit is in good agreement with previous results, and the
physical parameters implied by a combined fit to our visibility and radial
velocity data result in precise component masses and luminosities. In
particular, the orbital parallax of the system is determined to be 27.74 $\pm$
0.15 mas, and masses of the two components are determined to be 1.4160 $\pm$
0.0049 M$_{\sun}$ and 1.3740 $\pm$ 0.0045 M$_{\sun}$, respectively. Based on
theoretical models we can estimate a system age of approximately 3.2 Gyr.
Comparisons with stellar models suggest that the 12 Boo primary may be just
entering the Hertzsprung gap, but that conclusion is highly dependent on
details of the models. Such a dynamic evolutionary state makes the 12 Boo
system a unique and important test for stellar models.",2005-02-12T18:04:26Z
Self-enrichment in globular clusters. I. An analytic approach,"By means of analytical calculations, we explore the self-enrichment scenario
for Globular Cluster formation. According to this scenario, an initial burst of
star formation occurs inside the core radius of the initial gaseous
distribution. The outward-propagating shock wave sweeps up a shell in which
gravitational instabilities may arise, leading to the formation of a second,
metal-enriched, population of stars. We find a minimum mass of the
proto-globular cluster of the order of 10^6 solar masses. We also find that the
observed spread in the Magnitude-Metallicity relation can be explained assuming
cluster-to-cluster variations of some parameters like the thermalization
efficiency, the mixing efficiency and the Initial Mass Function, as well as
variations of the external pressure.",2005-02-22T09:46:59Z
The Dynamics of Brane-World Cosmological Models,"Brane-world cosmology is motivated by recent developments in string/M-theory
and offers a new perspective on the hierarchy problem. In the brane-world
scenario, our Universe is a four-dimensional subspace or {\em brane} embedded
in a higher-dimensional {\em bulk} spacetime. Ordinary matter fields are
confined to the brane while the gravitational field can also propagate in the
bulk, leading to modifications of Einstein's theory of general relativity at
high energies. In particular, the Randall-Sundrum-type models are
self-consistent and simple and allow for an investigation of the essential
non-linear gravitational dynamics. The governing field equations induced on the
brane differ from the general relativistic equations in that there are nonlocal
effects from the free gravitational field in the bulk, transmitted via the
projection of the bulk Weyl tensor, and the local quadratic energy-momentum
corrections, which are significant in the high-energy regime close to the
initial singularity. In this review we discuss the asymptotic dynamical
evolution of spatially homogeneous brane-world cosmological models containing
both a perfect fluid and a scalar field close to the initial singularity. Using
dynamical systems techniques it is found that, for models with a physically
relevant equation of state, an isotropic singularity is a past-attractor in all
orthogonal spatially homogeneous models (including Bianchi type IX models). In
addition, we describe the dynamics in a class of inhomogeneous brane-world
models, and show that these models also have an isotropic initial singularity.
These results provide support for the conjecture that typically the initial
cosmological singularity is isotropic in brane-world cosmology.",2005-04-09T18:12:26Z
Analysis of Microlensing Light Curves Induced by Multiple-Planet Systems,"To maximize the number of planet detections by increasing efficiency, current
microlensing follow-up observation experiments are focusing on
high-magnification events to search for planet-induced perturbations near the
peak of lensing light curves. It was known that by monitoring
high-magnification events, it is possible to detect multiplicity signatures of
planetary systems. However, it was believed that the interpretation of the
signals and the characterization of the detected multiple-planet systems would
be difficult due to the complexity of the magnification pattern in the central
region combined with the large number of lensing parameters required to model
multiple-planet systems. In this paper, we demonstrate that in many cases the
central planetary perturbations induced by multiple planets can be well
approximated by the superposition of the single planetary perturbations where
the individual planet-primary pairs act as independent binary lens systems
(binary superposition). The validity of the binary-superposition approximation
implies that the analysis of perturbations induced by multiple planets can be
greatly simplified because the anomalies produced by the individual planet
components can be investigated separately by using relatively much simpler
single-planetary analysis, and thus enables better characterization of these
systems.",2005-03-31T07:18:23Z
"Frequency and time profiles of metric wave isolated Type I solar noise
  storm bursts at high spectral and temporal resolution","Type I noise storms constitute a sizeable faction of the active-Sun radio
emission component. Observations of isolated instances of such bursts, in the
swept-frequency-mode at metric wavelengths, have remained sparse, with several
unfilled regions in the frequency coverage. Dynamic spectra of the burst
radiation, in the 30 - 130 MHz band, obtained from the recently commissioned
digital High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS) at the Gauribidanur Radio
Observatory, on account of the superior frequency and time resolution, have
unravelled in explicit detail the temporal and spectral profiles of isolated
bursts. Apart from presenting details on their fundamental emission features,
the time and frequency profile symmetry, with reference to custom-specific
Gaussian distributions, has been chosen as the nodal criterion to statistically
explain the state of the source regions in the vicinity of magnetic
reconnections, the latent excitation agent that contributes to plasma wave
energetics, and the quenching phenomenon that causes damping of the burst
emission.",2005-02-18T02:42:02Z
Absolute Spectrophotometry of Northern Compact Planetary Nebulae,"We present medium-dispersion spectra and narrowband images of six northern
compact planetary nebulae (PNe): BoBn 1, DdDm 1, IC 5117, M 1-5, M 1-71, and
NGC 6833. From broad-slit spectra, total absolute fluxes and equivalent widths
were measured for all observable emission lines. High signal-to noise emission
line fluxes of H-alpha, H-beta, [OIII], [NII], and HeI may serve as emission
line flux standards for northern hemisphere observers. From narrow-slit
spectra, we derive systemic radial velocities. For four PNe, available emission
line fluxes were measured with sufficient signal-to-noise to probe the physical
properties of their electron densities, temperatures, and chemical abundances.
BoBn 1 and DdDm 1, both type IV PNe, have an H-beta flux over three sigma away
from previous measurements. We report the first abundance measurements of M
1-71. NGC 6833 measured radial velocity and galactic coordinates suggest that
it is associated with the outer arm or possibly the galactic halo, and its low
abundance ([O/H]=1.3x10E-4) may be indicative of low metallicity within that
region.",2005-05-12T21:36:03Z
SiO Maser Sources toward Globular Clusters,"We report on the detection of SiO masers in Asymptotic Giant Branch variables
toward bulge/disk globular clusters. In five out of six cases, the radial
velocities are compatible with the optically measured radial velocities of
globular clusters in the assessed uncertainty. Two sources, toward Terzan~5 and
Terzan~12, lie very close to the cluster centers. The objects toward Pal~6 and
Terzan~12 have luminosities appropriate to the AGB tip in globular clusters,
while those toward NGC 6171, Pal~10, and Terzan~5 are brighter than expected.
It is suggested that the latter three may have evolved from merged binaries,
offering a test for binary-evolution scenarios in globular clusters, if the
membership is approved.",2005-02-09T05:22:04Z
"The Bolocam Lockman Hole Millimeter-Wave Galaxy Survey: Galaxy
  Candidates and Number Counts","We present results of a new deep 1.1 mm survey using Bolocam, a
millimeter-wavelength bolometer array camera designed for mapping large fields
at fast scan rates, without chopping. A map, galaxy candidate list, and derived
number counts are presented. This survey encompasses 324 arcmin^2 to an rms
noise level (filtered for point sources) of 1.4 mJy/beam and includes the
entire regions surveyed by the published 8 mJy 850 micron JCMT SCUBA and 1.2 mm
IRAM MAMBO surveys. We reduced the data using a custom software pipeline to
remove correlated sky and instrument noise via a principal component analysis.
Extensive simulations and jackknife tests were performed to confirm the
robustness of our source candidates and estimate the effects of false
detections, bias, and completeness. In total, 17 source candidates were
detected at a significance > 3.0 sigma, with six expected false detections.
Nine candidates are new detections, while eight candidates have coincident
SCUBA 850 micron and/or MAMBO 1.2 mm detections. From our observed number
counts, we estimate the underlying differential number count distribution of
submillimeter galaxies and find it to be in general agreement with previous
surveys. Modeling the spectral energy distributions of these submillimeter
galaxies after observations of dusty nearby galaxies suggests extreme
luminosities of L = 1.0-1.6 x 10^13 L_solar and, if powered by star formation,
star formation rates of 500-800 M_solar/yr.",2005-03-10T21:31:25Z
Star-Cluster Astrometry with Ground-Based Wide Field Imagers,"We show the astrometric potential of the Wide Field Imager at the focus of
the MPI-ESO 2.2m Telescope. Currently, we are able to measure the position of a
well-exposed star with a precision of $\sim$4 mas/frame in each coordinate
(under 0.8 arcsec seeing conditions). We present some preliminary results here.",2005-03-30T12:11:49Z
"A Candidate Neutron Star Associated with Galactic Center Supernova
  Remnant Sagittarius A East","We present imaging and spectral studies of the supernova remnant (SNR)
Sagittarius (Sgr) A East from deep observations with the {\it Chandra X-Ray
Observatory}. The spatially-resolved spectral analysis of Sgr A East reveals
the presence of a two-temperature thermal plasma ($kT$ $\sim$ 1 keV and 5 keV)
near the center of the SNR. The central region is dominated by emission from
highly-ionized Fe-rich ejecta. We estimate a conservative upper limit on the
total Fe ejecta mass of the SNR, M$_{Fe}$ $<$ 0.27 M$_{\odot}$. Comparisons
with standard SN nucleosynthesis models suggest that this Fe mass limit is
consistent with a Type II SN explosion for the origin of Sgr A East. On the
other hand, the soft X-ray emission extending toward the north of the SNR can
be described by a single-temperature ($kT$ $\sim$ 1.3 keV) thermal plasma with
normal chemical composition. This portion of the SNR is thus X-ray emission
from the heated interstellar medium rather than the metal-rich stellar ejecta.
We point out that a hard pointlike source CXOGC J174545.5$-$285829 (the
so-called ``cannonball'') at the northern edge of the SNR shows unusual X-ray
characteristics among other Galactic center sources. The morphological,
spectral, and temporal characteristics of this source suggest an identification
as a high-velocity neutron star. Based on the suggested Type II origin for the
SNR Sgr A East and the proximity between the two, we propose that CXOGC
J174545.5$-$285829 is a high-velocity neutron star candidate, born from the
core-collapse SN which also created the SNR Sgr A East.",2005-06-08T13:45:44Z
"Prospects for Extrasolar ""Earths"" in Habitable Zones","We have shown that Earth-mass planets could survive in variously restricted
regions of the habitable zones (HZs) of most of a sample of nine of the 102
main-sequence exoplanetary systems confirmed by 19 November 2003. In a
preliminary extrapolation of our results to the other systems, we estimate that
roughly a half of these systems could have had an Earth-mass planet confined to
the HZ for at least the most recent 1000 Ma. The HZ migrates outwards during
the main-sequence lifetime, and so this proportion varies with stellar age.
About two thirds of the systems could have such a planet confined to the HZ for
at least 1000 Ma at sometime during the main-sequence lifetime. Clearly, these
systems should be high on the target list for exploration for terrestrial
planets. We have reached this conclusion by launching putative Earth-mass
planets in various orbits and following their fate with mixed-variable
symplectic and hybrid integrators. Whether the Earth-mass planets could form in
the HZs of the exoplanetary systems is an urgent question that needs further
study.",2005-03-08T10:40:22Z
Low Temperature Opacities,"Previous computations of low temperature Rosseland and Planck mean opacities
from Alexander & Ferguson (1994) are updated and expanded. The new computations
include a more complete equation of state with more grain species and updated
optical constants. Grains are now explicitly included in thermal equilibrium in
the equation of state calculation, which allows for a much wider range of grain
compositions to be accurately included than was previously the case. The
inclusion of high temperature condensates such as Al$_2$O$_3$ and CaTiO$_3$
significantly affects the total opacity over a narrow range of temperatures
before the appearance of the first silicate grains.
  The new opacity tables are tabulated for temperatures ranging from 30000 K to
500 K with gas densities from 10$^{-4}$ g cm$^{-3}$ to 10$^{-19}$ g cm$^{-3}$.
Comparisons with previous Rosseland mean opacity calculations are discussed. At
high temperatures, the agreement with OPAL and Opacity Project is quite good.
Comparisons at lower temperatures are more divergent as a result of differences
in molecular and grain physics included in different calculations. The
computation of Planck mean opacities performed with the opacity sampling method
are shown to require a very large number of opacity sampling wavelength points;
previously published results obtained with fewer wavelength points are shown to
be significantly in error. Methods for requesting or obtaining the new tables
are provided.",2005-02-02T18:09:32Z
"High-resolution spectroscopy of the old open cluster Collinder
  261:abundances of Iron and other elements","We present the analysis of high resolution spectra of six red giant stars in
the old open cluster Collinder 261. Reddening values for individual stars,
derived from the relation between colours and temperatures (deduced from our
fully spectroscopic analysis) are consistent with previous determinations based
on photometry. For this cluster we derive an iron abundance of [Fe/H] = -0.03
+/- 0.03. We also obtain the abundances of light metals (O, Na and Al),
alpha-elements (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), elements of the Fe-group (Sc, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni)
and the neutron-capture element Ba. No intrinsic star-to-star scatter is
present in any of these elements within our sample. We compare our findings
with previous investigations on this cluster, discussing in detail differences
in analysis methods and results.",2005-05-30T17:43:53Z
RXTE observations of the dipping low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1624-49,"We analyse ~ 360 ks of archival data from the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer
(RXTE) of the 21 hr orbital period dipping low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1624-49. We
find that outside the dips the tracks in the colour-colour and
hardness-intensity diagrams (CDs and HIDs) are reminiscent of those of atoll
sources in the middle and upper parts of the banana branch. The tracks show
secular shifts up to ~ 10%. We study the power spectrum of 4U 1624-49 as a
function of the position in the CD. This is the first time power spectra of
this source are presented. No quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are found. The
power spectra are dominated by very low frequency noise (VLFN), characteristic
for atoll sources in the banana state, and band limited noise (BLN) which is
not reliably detected but may, uncharacteristically, strengthen and increase in
frequency with spectral hardness. The VLFN fits to a power law, which becomes
steeper when the source moves to the harder part of the CD. We conclude that 4U
1624-49 is an atoll source which in our observations is in the upper banana
branch. Combining this with the high (0.5-0.7 L_Edd) luminosity, the long-term
flux stability of the source as seen with the RXTE All-Sky Monitor (ASM), and
with the fact that it is an X-ray dip source, we conclude that 4U 1624-49 is
most likely a GX atoll source such as GX 3+1 and GX 9+9, but seen edge on.",2005-02-26T15:59:41Z
"Mutual information between geomagnetic indices and the solar wind as
  seen by WIND - implications for propagation time estimates","The determination of delay times of solar wind conditions at the sunward
libration point to effects on Earth is investigated using mutual information.
This measures the amount of information shared between two timeseries. We
consider the mutual information content of solar wind observations, from WIND,
and the geomagnetic indices. The success of five commonly used schemes for
estimating interplanetary propagation times is examined. Propagation assuming a
fixed plane normal at 45 degrees to the GSE x-axis (i.e. the Parker Spiral
estimate) is found to give optimal mutual information. The mutual information
depends on the point in space chosen as the target for the propagation
estimate, and we find that it is maximized by choosing a point in the nightside
rather than dayside magnetosphere. In addition, we employ recurrence plot
analysis to visualize contributions to the mutual information, this suggests
that it appears on timescales of hours rather than minutes.",2005-02-08T16:00:05Z
"Aperture Photometry of Saturated Star Images from Digitised Photographic
  Plates","Saturated stellar images on digitised photographic plates are many times
greater in area than the `seeing disk' seen in unsaturated CCD images. Indeed
the flux profile of a bright star can be traced out for several degrees from
the star's centre. The radius of the saturated stellar image can often be
directly related to the magnitude of the star, a fact well known and exploited
in iris photometry. In this work we compare the radial flux profile of stars in
the approximate range B ~9 to ~13 mag, obtained from scans of plates from the
Bamberg Sky Patrol archive, with a profile of the form measured by King. We
show that simple aperture photometry of saturated stellar images, obtained from
photo-positives of scanned photographic plates, yield data that are in
agreement with simulations using a (saturated) synthetic stellar radius
profile. Raw plate magnitudes from this aperture photometry can be easily and
satisfactorily transformed to standard magnitudes, as demonstrated in a recent
study carried out by the current authors.",2005-02-21T13:50:48Z
New H2O masers in Seyfert and FIR bright galaxies,"Extragalactic water vapor masers with 50, 1000, 1, and 230 solar (isotropic)
luminosities were detected toward Mrk1066 (UGC2456), Mrk34, NGC3556 and Arp299,
respectively. The interacting system Arp299 appears to show two maser hotspots
separated by 20 arcsec. A statistical analysis of 53 extragalactic H2O sources
indicates (1) that the correlation between IRAS Point Source and H2O
luminosities, established for individual star forming regions in the galactic
disk, also holds for AGN dominated megamaser galaxies, (2) that maser
luminosities are not correlated with 60/100 micron color temperatures and (3)
that only a small fraction of the luminous megamasers detectable with 100-m
sized telescopes have so far been identified. The slope of the H2O luminosity
function, -1.5, indicates that the number of detectable masers is almost
independent of their luminosity. If the LF is not steepening at very high maser
luminosities, H2O megamasers at significant redshifts should be detectable with
present day state-of-the-art facilities.",2005-03-03T13:03:24Z
Variable Star Candidates in an ACS Field of M31,"A search for variable stars is performed using two epochs of Hubble Space

square arcminute portion of M31. This data set reveals 254 sources that vary by
at least 4-sigma between epochs. The positions and 2-epoch B-band (equivalent)
photometry of these sources are presented. The photometry suggests that this
catalog includes most of the RR Lyrae population of this portion of M31.",2005-02-15T14:59:15Z
"Flux of light antimatter nuclei near earth, induced by Cosmic Rays in
  the Galaxy and in the atmosphere","The fluxes of light antinuclei A<=4 induced near earth by Cosmic Ray intera
ctions with the interstellar matter in the Galaxy and with the Earth
atmosphere, are calculated in a phenomenological framework. The hadronic
production cross section for antinucleons is based on a recent parametrization
of a wide set of accelerator data. The production of light nuclei is calculated
using coalescence models. For the standard coalescence model, the coalescence
radius is fitted to the available experimental data. The non annihilating
inelastic scattering process for the antideuterons is discussed and taken into
account for the first time via a more realistic procedure than used so far for
antiprotons.",2005-03-24T15:23:32Z
Afterglow emission from pair-loaded blast waves in gamma-ray bursts,"The MeV radiation front of gamma-ray bursts creates copious e+- pairs as it
propagates through an ambient medium. The created pairs enrich the leptonic
component of the medium by a large factor at distances R < R_load ~ 10^{16} cm
from the burst center. The following blast wave sweeps up the pair-rich medium
and then emits the observed afterglow radiation. We find that the afterglow has
a ""memory"" of e+- loading outside R_load. The e+- pairs remain in the swept-up
material and slowly cool down by emitting synchrotron radiation. They are
likely to dominate the blast-wave emission in IR, optical, and UV bands during
the first minutes of the observed afterglow. The expected e+- radiation is
described by a simple formula, which is derived analytically and checked by
numerical integration of synchrotron emission over the blast material; a
suitable Lagrangian formalism is developed for such calculations. The main
signature of e+- radiation is its flat (""white"") spectrum in a broad range of
frequencies from IR to UV and possibly soft X-rays. This radiation can be
detected by Swift satellite, which would enable new observational tests for the
explosion physics.",2005-03-02T20:04:04Z
"Binaries discovered by the SPY project. IV. Five single-lined DA double
  white dwarfs","We present results from our ongoing follow-up observations of double white
dwarf binaries detected in the ESO SN Ia Progenitor SurveY
  (SPY). We discuss our observing strategy and data analysis and present the
orbital solutions of five close double white dwarf binaries: HE0320-1917,
HE1511-0448, WD0326-273, WD1013-010 and WD1210+140. Their periods range from
0.44 to 3.22 days. In none of these systems we find any spectral lines
originating from the companion. This rules out main sequence companions and
indicates that the companion white dwarfs are significantly older and cooler
than the bright component. Infrared photometry suggests the presence of a cool,
helium-rich white dwarf companion in the binary
  WD0326-273. We briefly discuss the consequences of our findings for our
understanding of the formation and evolution of double white dwarfs.",2005-06-10T12:21:31Z
"Spectroscopic Confirmation of Multiple Red Galaxy-Galaxy Mergers in
  MS1054-03 (z=0.83)","We present follow-up spectroscopy of the galaxy cluster MS1054-03 (z=0.83)
confirming that at least six of the nine merging galaxy pairs identified by van
Dokkum et al. (1999) are indeed bound systems: they have projected separations
of R_s<10 kpc and relative line-of sight velocities of dv<165 km/s. For the
remaining three pairs, we were unable to obtain redshifts of both constituent
galaxies. To identify a more objective sample of merging systems, we select
bound red galaxy pairs (R_s<=30 kpc, dv<=300 km/s) from our sample of 121
confirmed cluster members: galaxies in bound red pairs make up 15.7+/-3.6% of
the cluster population. The (B-K_s) color-magnitude diagram shows that the pair
galaxies are as red as the E/S0 members and have a homogeneous stellar
population. The red pair galaxies span a large range in luminosity and internal
velocity dispersion to include some of the brightest, most massive members
(L>L*, sigma>200 km/s); these bound galaxy pairs must evolve into E/S0 members
by z~0.7. These results combined with MS1054's high merger fraction and
reservoir of likely future mergers indicates that most, if not all, of its
early-type members evolved from (passive) galaxy-galaxy mergers at z<~1.",2005-05-17T19:24:44Z
"UHE nuclei propagation and the interpretation of the ankle in the
  cosmic-ray spectrum","We consider the stochastic propagation of high-energy protons and nuclei in
the cosmological microwave and infrared backgrounds, using revised photonuclear
cross-sections and following primary and secondary nuclei in the full 2D
nuclear chart. We confirm earlier results showing that the high-energy data can
be fit with a pure proton extragalactic cosmic ray (EGCR) component if the
source spectrum is \propto E^{-2.6}. In this case the ankle in the CR spectrum
may be interpreted as a pair-production dip associated with the propagation. We
show that when heavier nuclei are included in the source with a composition
similar to that of Galactic cosmic-rays (GCRs), the pair-production dip is not
present unless the proton fraction is higher than 85%. In the mixed composition
case, the ankle recovers the past interpretation as the transition from GCRs to
EGCRs and the highest energy data can be explained by a harder source spectrum
\propto E^{-2.2} - E^{-2.3}, reminiscent of relativistic shock acceleration
predictions, and in good agreement with the GCR data at low-energy and holistic
scenarios.",2005-05-27T19:33:55Z
"Can Enhanced Diffusion Improve Helioseismic Agreement for Solar Models
  with Revised Abundances?","Recent solar photospheric abundance analyses (Asplund et al. 2004, 2005;
Lodders 2003) have revised downward the C, N, O, Ne, and Ar abundances by 0.15
to 0.2 dex compared to previous determinations of Grevesse & Sauval (1998).
With these revisions, the photospheric Z/X decreases to 0.0165 (0.0177
Lodders), and Z to ~0.0122 (0.0133 Lodders). A number of papers report that
solar models evolved with standard opacities and diffusion treatment using
these new abundances give poor agreement with helioseismic inferences. Here we
explore evolved solar models with varying diffusion treatments to reduce the
photospheric abundances while keeping the interior abundances about the same as
earlier standard models. While enhanced diffusion improves agreement with some
helioseismic constraints compared to a solar model evolved with the new
abundances using nominal input physics, the required increases in thermal
diffusion rates are unphysically large, and none of the variations tried
restores the good agreement attained using the earlier abundances. A
combination of modest opacity increases, diffusion enhancements, and abundance
increases near the level of the uncertainties, while somewhat contrived,
remains the most physically plausible means to restore agreement with
helioseismology. The case for enhanced diffusion would be improved if the
inferred convection-zone helium abundance could be reduced; we recommend
reconsidering this derivation in light of new equations of state with modified
abundances and other improvements. We also recommend considering, as a last
resort, diluting the convection zone, which contains only 2.5% of the sun's
mass, by accretion of material depleted in these more volatile elements C, N,
O, Ne, & Ar after the sun arrived on the main sequence.",2005-02-17T23:03:13Z
"Testing models of supermassive black hole seed formation through gravity
  waves","We study the gravitational wave background produced from the formation and
assembly of supermassive black holes within the cosmological paradigm of
hierarchical structure formation. In particular, we focus on a supermassive
black hole formation scenario in which the present-day population of
supermassive black holes is built from high-mass seed black holes and we
compute the concomitant spectrum of gravitational radiation produced by mergers
of the seed black holes. We find that this scenario predicts a large,
gravitational wave background that should be resolved into individual sources
with space interferometers such as the proposed Laser Interferometric Space
Antenna (LISA). The number of inspiral, merger and ringdown events above a
signal to noise ratio of 5 that result from massive black hole seeds is of
order 10^3. This prediction is robust and insensitive to several of the details
of the model. We conclude that an interferometer such as LISA will be able to
effectively rule out or confirm a class of models where supermassive black
holes grow from high-mass seed black holes and may be able to place strong
limits on the role of mergers as a channel for supermassive black hole growth.
Supermassive black hole seeds likely form in the earliest proto-galactic
structures at high redshift and the masses of supermassive black holes are
known to be strongly correlated with the potentials of the spheroids in which
they reside, therefore these results imply that space interferometers can be
used as a powerful probe of the physics of galaxy formation and proto-galaxy
formation at very high redshift.",2005-03-23T21:11:28Z
"The imprint of cosmological hydrogen recombination lines on the power
  spectrum of the CMB","We explore the imprint of the cosmological hydrogen recombination lines on
the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In particular, we
focus our analysis in the three strongest lines for the Balmer, Paschen and
Brackett series of hydrogen. We expect changes in the angular power spectrum
due to these lines on the level of $0.3 \mu K$ for the H$\alpha$ line, being
maximum at small angular scales ($\ell \approx 870$). The morphology of the
signal is very rich. It leads to relatively narrow spectral features ($\Delta
\nu / \nu \sim 10^{-1}$), with several regions in the power spectrum showing a
characteristic change of sign of the effect as we probe different redshifts or
different multipoles by measuring the power spectrum at different frequencies.
It also has a very peculiar dependence on the multipole scale, connected with
the details of the transfer function at the epoch of scattering. In order to
compute the optical depths for these transitions, we have evolved numerically
the populations of the levels of the hydrogen atom during recombination,
treating simultaneously the evolution of helium. For the hydrogen atom, we
follow each angular momentum state separately, up to the level n=10.
Foregrounds and other frequency dependent contaminants, as Rayleigh scattering,
may be a important limitation for these measurements, although the peculiar
frequency and angular dependences of the effect which we are discussing might
permit to separate it. Detection of this signal using future narrow-band
spectral observations can give information about the details of how the cosmic
recombination proceeds, and how Silk damping operates during recombination.",2005-02-28T12:22:39Z
Observational Studies of Early-type Binary Stars: MP Centauri,"We present photometric and spectroscopic data on the early-type binary MP
Centauri. The photometric data are analyzed simultaneously with radial
velocities to derive preliminary absolute dimensions for the binary components.
Analysis of the spectra shows that the stars rotate synchronously and that the
line of sight to the system crosses two kinematically sharp and well-separated
interstellar reddening sources. It is shown that MP Cen consists of a B3
primary with M_1 = 11.4 +/- 0.4 M_sun, R_1 = 7.7 +/- 0.1 R_sun and a
lobe-filling B6-B7 secondary with M_2 = 4.4 +/- 0.2 M_sun, R_2 = 6.6 +/- 0.1

Effects of Inhomogeneities on Cosmic Expansion,"We evaluate the effect of inhomogeneity energy on the expansion rate of the
universe. Our method is to expand to Newtonian order in potential and velocity
but to take into account fully nonlinear density inhomogeneities. To linear
order in density, kinetic and gravitational potential energy contribute to the
total energy of the universe with the same scaling with expansion factor as
spatial curvature. In the strongly nonlinear regime, growth saturates, and the
net effect of the inhomogeneity energy on the expansion rate remains negligible
at all times. In particular, inhomogeneity contributions never mimic the
effects of dark energy or induce an accelerated expansion.",2005-04-19T19:38:29Z
Signatures of Cosmic Strings in the Cosmic Microwave Background,"We report a search for signatures of cosmic strings in the the Cosmic
Microwave Background data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. We
used a digital filter designed to search for individual cosmic strings and
found no evidence for them in the WMAP CMB anisotropies to a level of $\Delta
T/T \sim 0.29$ mK. This corresponds to an absence of cosmic strings with $ G\mu
\ga 1.07 \times 10^{-5}$ for strings moving with velocity $v = c/\sqrt{2}$.
Unlike previous work, this limit does not depend on an assumed string
abundance. We have searched the WMAP data for evidence of a cosmic string
recently reported as the CSL-1 object, and found an ``edge'' with 2$\sigma$
significance. However, if this edge is real and produced by a cosmic string, it
would have to move at velocity $\ga$ 0.94c. We also present preliminary limits
on the CMB data that will be returned by the PLANCK satellite for comparison.
With the available information on the PLANCK satellite, we calculated that it
would be twice as sensitive to cosmic strings as WMAP.",2005-03-05T00:54:04Z
"An analysis of the distribution of background star polarization in dark
  clouds","The polarization observed for stars background to dark clouds (Bok Globules)
is often used as diagnostic to study the ongoing star formation processes in
these clouds. Such polarization in the optical have been reported for eight
nearby clouds CB3, CB25, CB39, CB52, CB54, CB58, CB62 and CB246 in one of our
previous work (Sen et. al. 2000). With a view to understand the origin of this
polarization, the the present work attempts are made to look for any possible
relation between this observed polarization and other physical parameters in
the cloud (like temperature, turbulence etc.). The observed polarization does
not seem to be clearly related to the dust and gas temperatures (T_d and T_g)
in the cloud as expected from the Davis-Greenstein grain alignment mechanism
(Davis & Greenstein, 1952). However, the average observed polarization p_av
appears to be related to the turbulence delta V (measured by 12CO line width)
by the mathematical relation p_av=2.95exp(-0.24delta V). The possible realtion
between the direction of polarization vector and other physical parameters are
also discussed. For this analysis, in addition to the data on above eight

Cyclotron Maser Emission from Blazar Jets?,"We consider the production of electron cyclotron maser emission by
low-density, highly magnetized plasmas in relativistic jets. The population
inversion required to drive cyclotron maser instability could occur in
localized, transient sites where hydromagnetic instabilities, shocks, and/or
turbulence lead to magnetic mirroring along current-carrying flux tubes. The
maser is pumped as electrons are accelerated by the parallel electric field
that develops as a result of the mirror. We estimate the maximum brightness
temperatures that can be obtained in a single maser site and in an array of
many masers operating simultaneously, under conditions likely to apply in
blazar jets. Synchrotron absorption, by relativistic electrons within the jet,
presents the largest obstacle to the escape of the maser radiation, and may
render most of it invisible. However, we argue that a high brightness
temperature could be produced in a thin boundary layer outside the synchrotron
photosphere, perhaps in the shear layer along the wall of the jet. Induced
Compton scattering provides additional constraints on the maximum brightness
temperature of a masing jet. We suggest that recent observations of diffractive
scintillation in the blazar J1819+3845, indicating intrinsic brightness
temperatures greater than 10^{14} K at 5 GHz, may be explained in terms of
cyclotron maser emission. High brightness temperature maser emission from
blazar jets may extend to frequencies as high as ~100 GHz, with the maximum
possible T_B scaling roughly as 1/frequency. Less massive relativistic jet
sources, such as microquasars, are even better candidates for producing
cyclotron maser emission, primarily in the infrared and optical bands.",2005-02-07T22:51:35Z
Probing the Epoch of Early Baryonic Infall Through 21cm Fluctuations,"After cosmological recombination, the primordial hydrogen gas decoupled from
the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and fell into the gravitational potential
wells of the dark matter. The neutral hydrogen imprinted acoustic oscillations
on the pattern of brightness fluctuations due to its redshifted 21cm absorption
of the CMB. Unlike CMB temperature fluctuations which probe the power spectrum
at cosmic recombination, we show that observations of the 21cm fluctuations at
z ~ 20-200 can measure four separate fluctuation modes (with a fifth mode
requiring very high precision), thus providing a unique probe of the geometry
and composition of the universe.",2005-02-03T21:51:24Z
"Discovery of a 105 ms X-ray Pulsar in Kesteven 79: On the Nature of
  Compact Central Objects in Supernova Remnants","We report the discovery of 105-ms X-ray pulsations from the compact central
object (CCO) in the supernova remnant Kes 79 using data acquired with the
Newton X-Ray Multi-Mirror Mission. Two observations of the pulsar taken 6 days
apart yield an upper limit on its spin-down rate of dP/dt < 7E-14 s/s and no
evidence for binary orbital motion. The implied energy loss rate is dE/dt <
2E36 ergs/s, surface magnetic field strength is B_p < 3E12 G, and spin-down age
is t > 24 kyr. The latter exceeds the remnant's estimated age, suggesting that
the pulsar was born spinning near its current period. The X-ray spectrum of PSR
J1852+0040 is best characterized by a blackbody model of temperature kT_BB =
0.44 +/- 0.03 keV, radius R_BB approx. 0.9 km, and L_bol = 3.7E33 ergs/s at d =
7.1 kpc. The sinusoidal light curve is modulated with a pulsed fraction of
>45%, suggestive of a small hot spot on the surface of the rotating neutron
star. The lack of a discernible pulsar wind nebula is consistent with an
interpretation of PSR J1852+0040 as a rotation-powered pulsar whose spin-down
luminosity falls below the empirical threshold for generating bright wind
nebulae, dE/dt_c approx. 4E36 ergs/s. The age discrepancy implies that its
dE/dt has always been below dE/dt_c, perhaps a distinguishing property of the
CCOs. Alternatively, the X-ray spectrum of PSR J1852+0040 suggests a
low-luminosity AXP, but the weak inferred B_p field is incompatible with a
magnetar theory of its X-ray luminosity. So far, we cannot exclude accretion
from a fall-back disk. The ordinary spin parameters discovered from PSR
J1852+0040 highlight the difficulty that existing theories of isolated neutron
stars have in explaining the high luminosities and temperatures of CCO thermal
X-ray spectra.",2005-03-19T01:23:25Z
Numerical Modelling of Dusty Debris Disks,"Infrared and submillimetre observations of nearby Vega-like stars have
revealed a number of clumpy, asymmetric dust debris disks. Previous studies
using semi-analytical and numerical methods have suggested planetary companions
of various mass as the likely cause of most examples of disk asymmetry. In this
paper, we modify an N-body symplectic gravitational integrator to include
radiation terms and conduct medium-resolution parameter searches to identify
likely planetary candidates in observed Vega-like systems. We also present high
resolution models of Vega and epsilon Eridani, comparing our results to those
of previous authors, and a new model for Fomalhaut.",2005-02-07T14:56:55Z
"An analytic approach to the late ISW effect in a Lambda dominated
  universe","The integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect in a Lambda dominated universe can be
an important factor in the evolution of cosmic microwave background
fluctuations. With the inclusion of cosmological constant we present the
complete analytic solution of the covariant linear perturbations of the
Einstein equations in the Newtonian gauge, in the case of a spatially flat
(K=0), Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe, filled with pressureless ideal
fluid. We use the analytic time dependence of the perturbation potentials to
derive the anisotropy power spectrum of the late ISW effect. We choose the

"Growth of Intermediate Massive Black Holes in the Hierarchical Formation
  of Small Spiral Galaxies in the High-z Universe","Combining a theoretical model of mass accretion onto a galactic center with a
high-resolution $N$-body/SPH simulation, we investigate the formation of an
intermediate massive black hole (IMBH) during the hierarchical formation of a
small spiral galaxy (with a total mass of $10^{10}M_{\odot}$) in the high-$z$
universe. We found that the rate of average mass accretion to the nucleus due
to the radiation drag exerted by newly formed stars in the forming galaxy is
$\approx 10^{-5}M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. As a result of this accretion, an IMBH
with $\approx 10^{4}M_{\odot}$ can be formed in the center of the spiral galaxy
at $z\sim 4$. We found that a central BH coevolves with the dark matter halo
from $z\sim 15$ to $z\sim 2$. The mass ratio of the BH to the dark matter halo
is nearly constant $\approx (1-3) \times 10^{-6}$ from $z\sim 10$ to $z\sim 2$.
This is because that change in the dark matter potential enhances star
formation in the central part of the galaxy, and as a result the BH evolves due
to mass accretion via the radiation drag. Therefore, our model naturally
predicts a correlation between massive BHs and dark matter halos. Moreover, it
is found that the final BH-to-bulge mass ratio ($\approx 5\times 10^{-5}$) in a
small spiral galaxy at high-$z$ is much smaller than that in the large galaxies
($\approx 10^{-3}$). Our results also suggest that the scatter in the observed
scaling relations between the bulge mass and black hole mass are caused by a
time lag between BH growth and growth of bulge. We also predict that the X-ray
luminosity of AGN is positively correlated with the CO luminosity in the
central region. By comparing our results with the properties of Lyman break
galaxies (LBGs), it is predicted that some LBGs have massive BHs of $\approx
10^{6}-10^{7}M_{\odot}$.",2005-04-08T14:09:45Z
"Self-regulated black hole accretion, the M-sigma relation, and the
  growth of bulges in galaxies","We argue that the velocity dispersions and masses of galactic bulges and
spheroids are byproducts of the feedback that regulates rapid black hole growth
in protogalaxies. We suggest that the feedback energy liberated by accretion
must pass through the accreting material, in an energy-conserving flux close-in
and a momentum-conserving flux further out. If the inflowing gas dominates the
gravitational potential outside the Bondi radius, feedback from
Eddington-limited accretion drives the density profile of the gas to that of a
singular isothermal sphere. We find that the velocity dispersion associated
with the isothermal potential, sigma, increases with time as the black hole
mass M grows, in such a way that M is proportional to sigma^4. The coefficient
of this proportionality depends on the radius at which the flow switches from
energy conserving to momentum conserving, and gives the observed M-sigma
relation if the transition occurs at ~100 Schwarzschild radii. We associate
this transition with radiative cooling and show that bremsstrahlung, strongly
boosted by inverse Compton scattering in a two-temperature (T_p >> T_e) plasma,
leads to a transition at the desired radius.
  According to this picture, bulge masses M_b are insensitive to the virial
masses of their dark matter haloes, but correlate linearly with black hole
mass. Our analytic model also explains the M_b-sigma (Faber-Jackson) relation
as a relic of black hole accretion. The model naturally explains why the
M-sigma relation has less scatter than either the M-M_b (Magorrian) or the
Faber-Jackson relation. It suggests that the M-sigma relation could extend down
to very low velocity dispersions, and predicts that the relation should not
evolve with redshift.",2005-04-18T21:23:19Z
"Astrometric Binaries in the Age of the Next Generation of Large (Space)

"Tracing the X-ray emitting intra-cluster medium of clusters of galaxies
  beyond r_200","(Abridged) We present in this paper a sample of 14 nearby clusters of
galaxies observed with the ROSAT/PSPC. We only select clusters with low
galactic nH in order to trace the X-ray emitting intra-cluster medium (ICM) out
to large radii. We convert the X-ray surface brightness profiles of the
clusters into emission measure profiles scaled to the classical scaling
relations based on the spherical collapse model. We sort the clusters into
different temperature bins and stack the scaled emission measure (ScEM)
profiles of clusters together. The stacked profiles allow us to observe out to
radii r>r_200. In the center we find that the ScEM profiles deviate from
predicted scaling laws. This result is in very good agreement with current
studies on the L_X-T relation and the entropy - temperature relation (S \propto
T^0.65) found recently. At radii r>0.4r_200 we find that the ScEM profiles
agree well within the error bars, suggesting self-similarity. Fitting
beta-models to the overall ScEM profiles we find for the different sub samples
r_c=0.15-0.18 r_200 and beta=0.8, which is higher than beta=2/3 often found.
The beta-model is generally a better representation for hotter than for cooler
clusters. We see indications for continuous steepening of the profiles with
increasing radius: at radii r>0.8r_200 the profiles are systematically below
the beta-model curve with beta=0.8. We discuss our results with respect to the
observed X-ray luminosity L_X-T relation, the gas mass M_gas-T relation and the
total mass M-T relation. We also address implications on the origin of the
observed S-T relation. Furthermore we discuss the observed steepness of the
X-ray profiles, which falls off more rapidly than predicted from the
NFW-profile for cold dark matter halos.",2005-05-03T06:41:11Z
Limits from the Hubble Space Telescope on a Point Source in SN 1987A,"We observed supernova 1987A (SN 1987A) with the Space Telescope Imaging
Spectrograph (STIS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in 1999 September, and
again with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on the HST in 2003 November.
No point source is observed in the remnant. We obtain a limiting flux of F_opt
< 1.6 x 10^{-14} ergs/s/cm^2 in the wavelength range 2900-9650 Angstroms for
any continuum emitter at the center of the supernova remnant (SNR). It is
likely that the SNR contains opaque dust that absorbs UV and optical emission,
resulting in an attenuation of ~35% due to dust absorption in the SNR. Taking
into account dust absorption in the remnant, we find a limit of L_opt < 8 x
10^{33} ergs/s. We compare this upper bound with empirical evidence from point
sources in other supernova remnants, and with theoretical models for possible
compact sources. Bright young pulsars such as Kes 75 or the Crab pulsar are
excluded by optical and X-ray limits on SN 1987A. Of the young pulsars known to
be associated with SNRs, those with ages < 5000 years are all too bright in
X-rays to be compatible with the limits on SN 1987A. Examining theoretical
models for accretion onto a compact object, we find that spherical accretion
onto a neutron star is firmly ruled out, and that spherical accretion onto a
black hole is possible only if there is a larger amount of dust absorption in
the remnant than predicted. In the case of thin-disk accretion, our flux limit
requires a small disk, no larger than 10^{10} cm, with an accretion rate no
more than 0.3 times the Eddington accretion rate. Possible ways to hide a
surviving compact object include the removal of all surrounding material at
early times by a photon-driven wind, a small accretion disk, or very high
levels of dust absorption in the remnant.",2005-05-04T01:17:28Z
Spectroscopic classification of cataclysmic variable candidates,"We present low resolution optical spectroscopy for six cataclysmic variable

density of the three cataclysmic variables.",2005-06-14T11:40:12Z
On quasar host galaxies as tests of non-cosmological redshifts,"Despite a general consensus in the astronomical community that all quasars
are located at the distances implied by their redshifts, a number of
observations still challenge this interpretation, possibly indicating that some
subpopulation of quasars may harbour significant redshift components not
related to the expansion of the universe. It has been suggested that these
objects may have been ejected from local galaxies and are likely to evolve into
new galaxies themselves. Here, a test of such exotic scenarios is proposed,
based on the spectral energy distribution of the galaxies hosting quasars with
suspected ejection origin. Provided that the time scales over which the ejected
objects manifest themselves as quasars is short, one would in the framework of
ejection scenarios expect to find either no quasar host galaxy, a pseudo-host
consisting of gas ionized by the quasar, or a host galaxy consisting of young
stars only. It is argued that the spectral energy distributions corresponding
to the latter two options should differ significantly from those of most quasar
host galaxies detected at low redshift so far, thus providing a potential test
of the claimed existence of ejected quasars. A minimal implementation of this
test, involving optical and near-IR broadband photometry, is suggested.",2005-06-06T16:00:18Z
"Coronal Evolution of the Sun in Time: High-Resolution X-Ray Spectroscopy
  of Solar Analogs with Different Ages","(abridged) We investigate the long-term evolution of X-ray coronae of solar
analogs based on high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy and photometry with
XMM-Newton. Six nearby main-sequence G stars with ages between ~0.1 Gyr and
\~1.6 Gyr and rotation periods between ~1d and 12.4d have been observed. We
derive coronal element abundances and the coronal emission measure distribution
(EMD). The abundances change from an inverse-First Ionization Potential (FIP)
distribution in stars with ages around 0.1 Gyr to a solar-type FIP distribution
in stars at ages of 0.3 Gyr and beyond. The coronal EMDs show shapes
characterized by power-laws on each side of the EMD peak. The latter shifts
from temperatures of about 10 MK in the most rapidly rotating, young stars to
temperatures around 4 MK in the oldest target considered here. The power-law
index on the cooler side of the EMD exceeds expected slopes for static loops,
with typical values being 1.5-3. We interpret this slope with a model in which
the coronal emission is due to a superposition of stochastically occurring
flares, with an occurrence rate that is distributed in radiated energy E as a
power-law, dN/dE ~ E^-a. Our EMDs indicate a ~ 2.2-2.8, in excellent agreement
with values previously derived from light curves of magnetically active stars.
We derive the range of flare energies required to explain the light-curve
modulation. In an overall scenario, we propose that flaring activity plays a
larger role in more active stars. In this model, the higher flare rate is
responsible both for the higher average coronal temperature and the high
coronal X-ray luminosity, two parameters that are indeed found to be
correlated.",2005-03-24T15:43:17Z

Canonical Particle Acceleration in FRI Radio Galaxies,"Matched resolution multi-frequency VLA observations of four radio galaxies
are used to derive the asymptotic low energy slope of the relativistic electron
distribution. Where available, low energy slopes are also determined for other
sources in the literature. They provide information on the acceleration physics
independent of radiative and other losses, which confuse measurements of the
synchrotron spectra in most radio, optical and X-ray studies. We find a narrow
range of inferred low energy electron energy slopes, n(E)=const*E^-2.1 for the
currently small sample of lower luminosity sources classified as FRI (not
classical doubles). This distribution is close to, but apparently inconsistent
with, the test particle limit of n(E)=const*E^-2.0 expected from strong
diffusive shock acceleration in the non-relativistic limit. Relativistic shocks
or those modified by the back-pressure of efficiently accelerated cosmic rays
are two alternatives to produce somewhat steeper spectra. We note for further
study the possiblity of acceleration through shocks, turbulence or shear in the
flaring/brightening regions in FRI jets as they move away from the nucleus.
Jets on pc scales and the collimated jets and hot spots of FRII (classical
double) sources would be governed by different acceleration sites and
mechanisms; they appear to show a much wider range of spectra than for FRI
sources.",2005-02-26T14:37:57Z
GRB follow-up observations in the East-Asian region,"In 2004, we established a Japan-Taiwan-China collaboration for GRB study in
the East-Asian region. This serves as a valuable addition to the world-wide
optical and infrared follow-up network, because the East-Asia region would
otherwise be blank. We have been carrying out imaging and spectroscopic
follow-up observations at Lulin (Taiwan), Kiso (Japan), WIDGET (Japan) and
Xinglong (China). From Xinglong and Kiso, we can locate candidates and obtain
early time spectra for afterglows. While WIDGET provides early time
observations before the burst, the high-time resolution for multi-band light
curves can be obtained at Lulin. With the data from these sites, we can obtain
detailed information about the light curve and redshift of GRBs, which are
important to understand the mechanism of the afterglows. Up to March 2005, ten
follow-up observations have been provided by this East-Asia cooperation. Two
optical afterglows were detected, GRB 040924 and GRB 041006. The results of the
two detected afterglows are reported in this article.",2005-06-10T12:27:38Z
On the anomalous red giant branch of the globular cluster Omega Cen,"We present three different optical and near-infrared (NIR) data sets for
evolved stars in the Galactic Globular Cluster Omega Cen The comparison between
observations and homogeneous sets of stellar isochrones and Zero-Age Horizontal
Branches provides two reasonable fits. Both of them suggest that the so-called
anomalous branch has a metal-intermediate chemical composition (-1.1 < [Fe/H] <
-0.8) and is located ~500 pc beyond the bulk of Omega Cen stars. These findings
are mainly supported by the shape of the subgiant branch in four different
color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). The most plausible fit requires a higher
reddening, E(B-V)=0.155 vs. 0.12, and suggests that the anomalous branch is
coeval, within empirical and theoretical uncertainties, to the bulk of Omega
Cen stellar populations. This result is supported by the identification of a
sample of faint horizontal branch stars that might be connected with the
anomalous branch. Circumstantial empirical evidence seems to suggest that the
stars in this branch form a clump of stars located beyond the cluster.",2005-02-28T18:21:49Z
"Superfluid Spin-down, with Random Unpinning of the Vortices","The so-called ``creeping'' motion of the pinned vortices in a rotating
superfluid involves ``random unpinning'' and ``vortex motion'' as two
physically separate processes. We argue that such a creeping motion of the
vortices need not be (biased) in the direction of an existing radial Magnus
force, nor should a constant microscopic radial velocity be assigned to the
vortex motion, in contradiction with the basic assumptions of the ``vortex
creep'' model. We point out internal inconsistencies in the predictions of this
model which arise due to this unjustified foundation that ignores the role of
the actual torque on the superfluid. The proper spin-down rate of a pinned
superfluid is then calculated and turns out to be much less than that suggested
in the vortex creep model, hence being of even less observational significance
for its possible application in explaining the post-glitch relaxations of the
radio pulsars.",2005-04-25T05:08:11Z
"X-ray outburst of 4U 0115+634 and ROTSE Observations of its Optical
  Counterpart V635 Cas","ROTSE IIId (The Robotic Optical Transient Experiment) observations of X-ray
binary system 4U 0115+634/V635 Cas obtained during 2004 June and 2005 January
make possible, for the first time, to study the correlation between optical and
type II X-ray outbursts. The X-ray outburst sharply enhanced after periastron
passage where the optical brightness was reduced by 0.3 magnitude for a few
days. We interpret the sharp reduction of optical brightness as a sign of mass
ejection from the outer parts of the disc of the Be star. After this sharp
decrease, the optical brightness healed and reached the pre X-ray outburst
level. Afterwards, gradual decrease of the optical brightness followed a
minimum then a gradual increase started again. Qualitatively, change of optical
lightcurve suggests a precession of the Be star disc around a few hundred days.
We also investigate the periodic signatures from the archival RXTE-ASM (Rossi
X-ray Timing Explorer - All Sky Monitor) light curve covering a time span of
$\sim 9$ years. We find significant orbital modulation in the ASM light curve
during the type I X-ray outburst.",2005-06-07T07:41:00Z
"The double-mode nature of the HADS star GSC 00144-03031 and the Petersen
  diagram of the class","The double--mode pulsation of GSC 00144-03031 has been detected when
searching for COROT targets. A very large dataset composed of 4722 photometric
measurements was collected at six observatories in Europe and America. There is
no hint of the excitation of additional modes (down to 0.6 mmag) and therefore
GSC 00144-03031 seems to be a pure double--mode pulsator, with a very short
fundamental radial mode (P=84 min). From Stromgren photometry and evolutionary
tracks it appears to be a Pop. I star with M=1.75 solar masses, located in the
middle of the instability strip, close to the Zero--Age Main Sequence. We also
discovered other new double--mode pulsators in the databases of large--scale
projects: OGLE BW2_V142, OGLE BW1_V207, ASAS3 094303-1707.3, ASAS3

is presented and explained by means of new models. A common sequence connecting
Pop. I stars from the shortest to the longest periods is proposed and the
spreads in the period ratios are ascribed to different metallicities (at the
shortest periods) and to different masses (at the longest ones). The paper is
based on data collected at S. Pedro Martir and Sierra Nevada Observatories and
on the contributions from several amateur astronomers.",2005-06-13T10:15:05Z
The dark matter content of early-type barred galaxies,"The dynamics of a barred galaxy depends on the pattern speed of its bar. The
only direct method for measuring the pattern speed of a bar is the
Tremaine-Weinberg technique. This method relies on the analysis of the
distribution and dynamics of the stellar component. It is best suited to
gas-poor galaxies and therefore it has been restricted to early-type barred
galaxies. On the other hand, a variety of indirect methods, which are based on
the analysis of the distribution and dynamics of the gaseous component, has
been used to measure the bar pattern speed in late-type barred galaxies. The
complete sample of galaxies for which the bar pattern speed has been directly
measured with the Tremaine-Weinberg method is given. Nearly all the measured
bars are as rapidly rotating as they can be. By comparing this result with
recent high-resolution N-body simulations of bars in cosmologically-motivated
dark matter halos, it is possible to conclude that these bars are not located
inside centrally-concentrated halos.",2005-04-09T15:13:42Z
Cosmic Ray Spectral Deformation Caused by Energy Determination Errors,"Using simulation methods, distortion effects on energy spectra caused by
errors in the energy determination have been investigated. For cosmic ray
proton spectra, falling steeply with kinetic energy E as E-2.7, significant
effects appear. When magnetic spectrometers are used to determine the energy,
the relative error increases linearly with the energy and distortions with a
sinusoidal form appear starting at an energy that depends significantly on the
error distribution but at an energy lower than that corresponding to the
Maximum Detectable Rigidity of the spectrometer. The effect should be taken
into consideration when comparing data from different experiments, often having
different error distributions.",2005-05-10T14:57:40Z
"Constraints on the dark energy equation of state from the imprint of
  baryons on the power spectrum of clusters","Acoustic oscillations in the baryon-photon fluid leave a signature in the
matter power spectrum. The overall shape of the spectrum and the wavelength of
the oscillations depend upon the sound horizon scale at recombination. Using
the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter Hubble Volume simulation, we show that the
imprint of baryons is visible in the power spectrum of cluster-mass dark matter
haloes, in spite of significant differences between the halo power spectrum and
the prediction of linear perturbation theory. A measurement of the sound
horizon scale can constrain the dark energy equation of state. We show that a
survey of clusters at intermediate redshift ($ z\sim1 $), like the
Sunyaev-Zeldovich survey proposed by the South Pole Telescope or a red sequence
photometric survey with VISTA, could potentially constrain the sound horizon
scale to an accuracy of $\sim 2%$, in turn fixing the ratio of the pressure of
the dark energy to its density ($w$) to better than $\sim 10%$. Our approach
does not require knowledge of the cluster mass, unlike those that depend upon
the abundance of clusters.",2005-04-21T13:46:03Z
Runaway collisions in young star clusters. II. Numerical results,"We present a new study of the collisional runaway scenario to form an
intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH, MBH > 100 Msun) at the centre of a young,
compact stellar cluster. The first phase is the formation of a very dense
central core of massive stars (Mstar =~ 30-120 Msun) through mass segregation
and gravothermal collapse. Previous work established the conditions for this to
happen before the massive stars evolve off the main sequence (MS). In this and
a companion paper, we investigate the next stage by implementing direct
collisions between stars. Using a Monte Carlo stellar dynamics code, we follow
the core collapse and subsequent collisional phase in more than 100 models with
varying cluster mass, size, and initial concentration. Collisions are treated
either as ideal, ``sticky-sphere'' mergers or using realistic prescriptions
derived from 3-D hydrodynamics computations. In all cases for which the core
collapse happens in less than the MS lifetime of massive stars (~3 Myr), we
obtain the growth of a single very massive star (VMS, Mstar =~ 400-4000 Msun)
through a runaway sequence of mergers. Mass loss from collisions, even for
velocity dispersions as high as sigma1D ~ 1000 km/s, does not prevent the
runaway. The region of cluster parameter space leading to runaway is even more
extended than predicted in previous work because, in clusters with sigma1D >
300 km/s, collisions accelerate (and, in extreme cases, drive) core collapse.
Although the VMS grows rapidly to > 1000 Msun in models exhibiting runaway, we
cannot predict accurately its final mass. This is because the termination of
the runaway process must eventually be determined by a complex interplay
between stellar dynamics, hydrodynamics, and the stellar evolution of the VMS.

"On the nature of bulges in general and of box/peanut bulges in
  particular. Input from $N$-body simulations","Objects designated as bulges in disc galaxies do not form a homogeneous
class. I distinguish three types. The classical bulges, whose properties are

peanut bulges, which are seen in near edge-on galaxies and which are in fact
just a part of the bar seen edge-on. Finally disc-like bulges, which result
from the inflow of (mainly) gas to the center-most parts, and subsequent star
formation. I make a detailed comparison of the properties of boxy and peanut
bulges with those of $N$-body bars seen edge-on and answer previously voiced
objections about the links between the two. I also present and analyse
simulations where a boxy /peanut feature is present at the same time as a
classical spheroidal bulge and compare them with observations. Finally, I
propose a nomenclature that can help distinguish between the three types of
bulges and avoid considerable confusion.",2005-02-16T13:03:21Z
The baryon content of the Universe,"The large discrepancy between the amount of baryons that were synthesized in
Big-Bang and that we detect at $z=0$ locked in stars inside galaxies and in
hot/cold gas in galaxies. goup and clusters, is a well known crucial issue for
present day cosmology. It is also thought that this riddle is at the backbone
of how the ordinary matter has formed, inside dark potential wells, the
structures we see today. Then, it is useful to reprint, by means of this
archive, the first (pre- astro-ph era) published work in which the amount of
""luminous"" baryons was actually and suitably computed and the disagreement with
the BBN predictions strongly claimed. This because 12 years after the method
and the results are still up-to-date, and above all, people are occasionally
found to know only later works (appeared on astro-ph) that were meant to be
just (ours or other's) follow ups of the present paper.",2005-02-09T10:32:34Z
"The Chandra Observation of the Shell of Nova Persei 1901 (GK Persei):
  Detection of localized Non-thermal X-ray Emission from a Miniature Supernova
  Remnant","I present the data of the shell of classical Nova Persei (1901) obtained by
the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer S3 detector on-board \cha Observatory.
The X-ray nebula is affected mostly by the complex interstellar medium around
the nova and has not developed a regular shell with bulk of emission coming
from the southwestern quadrant. The part of the bright zone that is co-spatial
with the brightest non-thermal radio emission region, is found to be a source
of non-thermal X-ray emission with a power law photon index of
2.3$^{+1.5}_{-0.9}$ and alpha=0.68^${+0.03}_{-0.15}$ at about a flux of
1.7x10^{-13} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}. There are strong indications for nonlinear
diffusive shock acceleration occurring in the forward shock/transition zone
with an upper limit on the non-thermal X-ray flux of 1.0\times 10^{-14} erg
cm^{-2} s^{-1}.The total X-ray spectrum of has two components of emission. The
component dominant below 2 keV is most likely a non-equilibrium ionization
thermal plasma of kT_s=0.1-0.3 keV with an X-ray flux of 1.6x10^{-11} erg
cm^{-2} s^{-1}. There is also a higher temperature, kT_s=0.5-2.6 keV, embedded,
N_H=(4.0-22.0)x10^{22} cm^{-2}, emission component prominent above 2 keV. The
unabsorbed X-ray flux from this component is 1.5x10^{-10} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}.
The X-ray emitting plasma is of solar composition except for enhancement in the
elemental abundances (mean abundances over the remnant)of Ne/Ne$_{\odot}$ and
N/N$_{\odot}$ in a range 13-21 and 1-5, respectively. A distinct emission line
of neon, He-like Ne IX, is detected which reveals a distribution of several
emission knots/blobs and shows a cone-like structure with wings extending
toward NW and SE at expansion velocities about 2600 km s^{-1} in the X-rays.",2005-03-07T00:08:09Z
"Age spreads in star forming regions: The lithium test in the Orion
  Nebula Cluster","We present the initial results of a study of the surface lithium abundance in
a sample of low-mass members (M~0.4-1.0 Msun) of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC)
that provide an independent clock to estimate stellar ages. We report discovery
of significant depletion of lithium in four stars with estimated mass of ~0.4
Msun and age ~10Myr. Comparison with the predictions of numerical and
analytical models shows excellent agreement between the isochronal age and
lithium depletion time scale for two objects, the first case in lithium-poor
pre-main sequence stars. Our results bear on the issue of the real age spread
in the ONC and hence on the overall duration of the star formation process,
indicating that the stellar population did not came into existence in a single,
rapid burst.",2005-05-09T08:39:34Z
The Anthropic Principle and the Duration of the Cosmological Past,"The place of an anthropic argument in the discrimination between various
cosmological models is to be reconsidered following the classic criticisms of
Paul C. W. Davies and Frank J. Tipler. Different versions of the anthropic
argument against cosmologies involving an infinite series of past events are
analyzed and applied to several instructive instances. This is not only of
historical significance but presents an important topic for the future of
cosmological research if some of the contemporary inflationary models,
particularly Linde's chaotic inflation, turn out to be correct. Cognitive
importance of the anthropic principle(s) to the issue of extraterrestrial
intelligent observers is reconsidered in this light and several related
problems facing cosmologies with past temporal infinities are also clearly
defined. This issue is not only a clear example of the epistemological
significance of the anthropic principle, but also has consequences for such
diverse topics as SETI studies, epistemological status of cosmological
concepts, theory of observation selection effects, and history of astronomy.",2005-04-30T14:26:02Z
"Polarization from a Strongly Magnetized Accretion Disks: Asymptotic
  Wavelength Behaviour","We calculate the polarization of radiation from thick accretion disks with
vertically averaged global magnetic field. The polarization arises as a result
of the radiation scattering by free electrons in magnetized plasma of a disk.
We consider as a basic effect the Faraday rotation of polarization plane along
the photon propagation in a magnetized disk. The various models of optically
thick accretion disk with a vertically averaged magnetic field are considered.
The main goal of this paper is to obtain simple asymptotic formulae for the
polarization of radiation when the Faraday rotation angle >> 1 at the Thomson
optical length ~1. The results of our calculation allows us to estimate the
magnetic field magnitude near the marginally stable orbit region of a black
hole via the data of polarimetric observations including the expected future
X-ray polarimetric observations. The wavelength dependence of polarization is
strongly dependent on various models of an accretion disks and thus allows to
choose a real model from the polarization data.",2005-03-05T10:37:40Z
"Detection of a classical Delta Scuti star in the new eclipsing binary
  system HIP 7666","HIP 7666 is a variable star newly discovered during the Hipparcos mission and
classified as of unknown type (ESA 1997). During 23 nights between July 2000
and November 2000, over 2300 CCD observations in the V band were obtained from
Hostalets de Pierola and Monegrillo observatories in Spain. These data show
that the new variable is a detached eclipsing binary system with an orbital
period of 2.37229 days. In addition, one of the components undergoes very
short-period oscillations with a main pulsation frequency of 24.46 or 25.47
c/d. HIP 7666 is therefore a new member of the presently very few known
detached eclipsing binary systems with a Delta Scuti type component.",2005-05-17T09:14:32Z
Intra-night Optical Variability of Luminous Radio Quiet QSOs,"In the present paper we report the detection of intra-night variability in
some of the RQQSOs and one LDQ. To study intra-night variability, we carried
out photometric monitoring of seven RQQSOs and one LDQ in Johnson V-passband
using 1.2 meter optical/IR telescope at Gurushikhar, Mount Abu, India.
Observations were made in nine nights during the first half of the year 2000;
seven RQQSOs: 0748+291, 0945+438, 1017+280, 1029+329, 1101+319, 1225+317,
1252+020 and one LDQ: 1103-006 were observed. RQQSOs 0748+291, 1225+317 and LDQ
1103-006 have shown existence of intra-night variations. In the case of
1017+280 (RQQSO) there is indication of intra-night variation in one night
where as the observations in another night do not show convincingly the
existence of intra-night variability. RQQSOs 0945+438, 1029+329, 1101+319 and
1252+020 have not shown any intra-night variations. We compiled intra-night
variability data for radio-loud and radio-quiet AGNs from the literature for
statistical analysis. It is found that a good fraction of radio-quiet AGNs show
intra-night variations with the maximum amplitude of variation being about 10%.
On the other hand blazars show at times intra-night flux variability up to
100%. In case of radio-loud AGNs (excluding blazars), maximum amplitude of
intra-night variation lies between the variability amplitude of radio-quiet
AGNs and blazars i.e. the flux variation is close to 50%. The results indicate
that the energy generation mechanism and the environment around the central
engine in different classes of AGNs may be similar, if not identical. The
standard model for radio-loud AGNs, where shocks are propagating down
relativistic jet or models based on disturbances in accretion disks can also
explain the micro-variability in RQQSOs.",2005-05-31T15:22:34Z
"The Star Cluster Population of M51: III. Cluster disruption and
  formation history","In this work we concentrate on the evolution of the cluster population of the
interacting galaxy M51 (NGC 5194), namely the timescale of cluster disruption
and possible variations in the cluster formation rate. We present a method to
compare observed age vs. mass number density diagrams with predicted
populations including various physical input parameters like the cluster
initial mass function, cluster disruption, cluster formation rate and star
bursts. If we assume that the cluster formation rate increases at the moments
of the encounters with NGC 5195, we find an increase in the cluster formation
rate of a factor of 3, combined with a disruption timescale which is slightly
higher then when assuming a constant formation rate (t_4 = 200 Myr vs. 100
Myr). The measured cluster disruption time is a factor of 5 shorter than
expected on theoretical grounds. This implies that the disk of M51 is not a
preferred location for survival of young globular clusters, since even clusters
with masses of the order of 10^6 M_sun will be destroyed within a few Gyr.",2005-06-02T20:38:36Z
Probing MACHOs Toward the Galactic Bulge,"If the massive compact halo object (MACHO) fraction of the Galactic dark halo
is f ~ 20% as suggested by some microlensing experiments, then about 1.2% of
lensing events toward the Galactic bulge are due to MACHOs. For the 40% of
these that lie nearby (D_l < 4 kpc), measurement of their distance D_l would
distinguish them from bulge lenses, while measurement of their transverse
velocity v_l would distinguish them from disk lenses. Hence, it would be
possible to identify about 0.5%(f/20%) of all events as due to MACHOs. I show
that a planned experiment using the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM
PlanetQuest) could thereby detect 1 or 2 such events. This is at the margin of
what is required because of a small, but non-negligible background from
spheroid stars.",2005-03-28T21:01:55Z
Large Scale Structure at 24 Microns in the SWIRE Survey,"We present initial results of galaxy clustering at 24um by analyzing
statistics of the projected galaxy distribution from counts-in-cells. This
study focuses on the ELAIS-N1 SWIRE field. The sample covers ~5.9
square-degrees and contains 24,715 sources detected at 24um to a 5.6-sigma
limit of 250 micro-Jy (in the lowest coverage regions). We have explored
clustering as a function of 3.6 - 24um color and 24um flux density using
angular-averaged two-point correlation functions derived from the variance of
counts-in-cells on scales 0.05-0.7 degrees. Using a power-law parameterization,
$w_{2}(\theta)=A(\theta/deg)^{1-\gamma}$, we find [A,\gamma] =
[(5.43\pm0.20)\times10^{-4},2.01\pm0.02] for the full sample (1-sigma errors
throughout). We have inverted Limber's equation and estimated a spatial
correlation length of $r_{0}=3.32\pm0.19 h^{-1}$Mpc for the full sample,
assuming stable clustering and a redshift model consistent with observed 24um
counts. We also find that blue [f(24)/f(3.6)<=5.5] and red [f(24)/f(3.6)>=6.5]
galaxies have the lowest and highest $r_{0}$ values respectively, implying that
redder galaxies are more clustered (by a factor of ~3 on scales >0.2 degree).
Overall, the clustering estimates are smaller than those derived from optical
surveys, but in agreement with results from IRAS and ISO in the mid-infrared.
This extends the notion to higher redshifts that infrared selected surveys show
weaker clustering than optical surveys.",2005-03-08T01:40:49Z
"Could the 47 UMa Planetary System be a Second Solar System: predicting
  the Earth-like planets","(Abridged)We numerically investigated the dynamical architecture of 47 UMa
with the planetary configuration of the best-fit orbital solutions by Fischer
et al. We systematically studied the existence of Earth-like planets in the
region 0.05 AU $\leq a \leq 2.0$ AU for 47 UMa with numerical simulations, and
we also explored the packed planetary geometry and Trojan planets in the
system. In the simulations, we found that ""hot Earths"" at 0.05 AU $\leq a < $
0.4 AU can dynamically survive at least for 1 Myr. The Earth-like planets can
eventually remain in the system for 10 Myr in areas involved in the mean motion
resonances (MMR) (e.g., 3:2 MMR) with the inner companion. Moreover, we showed
that the 2:1 and 3:1 resonances are on the fringe of stability, while the 5:2
MMR is unstable. Additionally, the 2:1 MMR marks out a remarkable boundary
between chaotic and regular motions, inside, most of the orbits can survive,
outside, they are mostly lost in the orbital evolution. In a dynamical sense,
the most likely candidate for habitable environment is Earth-like planets with
orbits in the ranges 0.8 AU $\leq a < 1.0$ AU and 1.0 AU $ < a < 1.30$ AU
(except several unstable cases) with relatively low eccentricities. The Trojan
planets with low eccentricities and inclinations can secularly last at the
triangular equilibrium points of two massive planets. Hence, the 47 UMa
planetary system may be a close analog to our solar system.",2005-06-16T08:42:39Z
"Ages, metallicities and $α$-element enhancement for galaxies in
  Hickson compact groups","Central velocity dispersions and eight line-strength Lick indices have been
determined from 1.3${\rm \AA}$ resolution long-slit spectra of 16 elliptical
galaxies in Hickson compact groups. These data were used to determine galaxy
properties (ages, metallicities and $\alpha$-element enhancements) and allowed
a comparison with the parameters determined for a sample of galaxies in lower
density environments, studied by Gonz\'alez (1993). The stellar population
parameters were derived by comparison to single stellar population models of
Thomas et al. (2003) and to a new set of SSP models for the indices Mg$_2$,
Fe5270 and Fe5335 based on synthetic spetra. These models, based on an update
version of the fitting functions presented in Barbuy et al. (2003), are fully
described here. Our main results are: (1) the two samples have similar mean
values for the metallicities and [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios, (2) the majority of the
galaxies in compact groups seem to be old (median age of 14 Gyr for eight
galaxies for which ages could be derived), in agreement with recent work by
Proctor et al. (2004). These findings support two possible scenarios: compact
groups are either young systems whose members have recently assembled and had
not enough time to experience any merging yet or, instead, they are old systems
that have avoided merging since their time of formation.",2005-03-04T14:21:24Z
"Constraining the mass transfer in massive binaries through progenitor
  evolution models of Wolf-Rayet+O binaries","Since close WR+O binaries are the result of a strong interaction of both
stars in massive close binary systems, they can be used to constrain the highly
uncertain mass and angular momentum budget during the major mass transfer
phase. We explore the progenitor evolution of the three best suited WR+O
binaries HD 90657, HD 186943 and HD 211853, which are characterized by a WR/O
mass ratio of $\sim$0.5 and periods of 6..10 days. We are doing so at three
different levels of approximation: predicting the massive binary evolution
through simple mass loss and angular momentum loss estimates, through full
binary evolution models with parametrized mass transfer efficiency, and through
binary evolution models including rotation of both components and a physical
model which allows to compute mass and angular momentum loss from the binary
system as function of time during the mass transfer process. All three methods
give consistently the same answers. Our results show that, if these systems
formed through stable mass transfer, their initial periods were smaller than
their current ones, which implies that mass transfer has started during the
core hydrogen burning phase of the initially more massive star. Furthermore,
the mass transfer in all three cases must have been highly non-conservative,
with on average only $\sim$10% of the transferred mass being retained by the
mass receiving star. This result gives support to our system mass and angular
momentum loss model, which predicts that, in the considered systems, about 90%
of the overflowing matter is expelled by the rapid rotation of the mass
receiver close to the $\Omega$-limit, which is reached through the accretion of
the remaining 10%.",2005-04-11T14:16:46Z
"A safety net for fast migrators: Interactions between gap-opening and
  sub-gap-opening bodies in a protoplanetary disk","Young planets interact with their parent gas disks through tidal torques. An
imbalance between inner and outer torques causes bodies of mass $\ga 0.1$ Earth
masses to lose angular momentum and migrate inward rapidly relative to the
disk; this is known as ``Type I'' migration. However, protoplanets that grow to
gas giant mass, O($10^2) M_\oplus$, open a gap in the disk and are subsequently
constrained to migrate more slowly, locked into the disk's viscous evolution in
what is called ""Type II"" migration. In a young planetary system, both Type I
and Type II bodies likely coexist; if so, differential migration ought to
result in close encounters when the former originate on orbits exterior to the
latter. We investigate the resulting dynamics, using two different numerical
approaches: an N-body code with dissipative forces added to simulate the effect
of the gas disk, and a hybrid code which combines an N-body component with a
1-dimensional viscous disk model, treating planet-disk interactions in a more
self-consistent manner. In both cases, we find that sub-gap-opening bodies have
a high likelihood of being resonantly captured when they encounter a
gap-opening body. A giant planet thus tends to act as a barrier in a
protoplanetary disk, collecting smaller protoplanets outside of its orbit. Such
behavior has two important implications for giant planet formation: First, for
captured protoplanets it mitigates the problem of the migration timescale
becoming shorter than the growth timescale. Secondly, it suggests one path to
forming systems with multiple giant planets: Once the first has formed, it
traps/accretes the future solid core of the second in an exterior mean-motion
resonance, and so on. The most critical step in giant planet formation may thus
be the formation of the very first one.",2005-02-21T17:48:37Z
"MHD Turbulence: Properties of Alfven, Slow and Fast Modes","We summarise basic properties of MHD turbulence. First, MHD turbulence is not
so messy as it is believed. In fact, the notion of strong non-linear coupling
of compressible and incompressible motions along MHD cascade is not tenable.
Alfven, slow and fast modes of MHD turbulence follow their own cascades and
exhibit degrees of anisotropy consistent with theoretical expectations. Second,
the fast decay of turbulence is not related to the compressibility of fluid.
Rates of decay of compressible and incompressible motions are very similar.
Third, the properties of Alfven and slow modes are similar to their
counterparts in the incompressible MHD. The properties of fast modes are
similar to accoustic turbulence, which does require more studies. Fourth, the
density at low Mach numbers and logarithm of density at higher Mach numbers
exhibit Kolmogorov-type spectrum.",2005-05-29T00:30:41Z
"Lorentz-violation and cosmological perturbations: a toy brane-world
  model","We study possible effects of Lorentz-violation on the generation of
cosmological perturbations at inflation by introducing a simple inflating
five-dimensional brane-world setup with violation of four-dimensional
Lorentz-invariance at an energy scale $k$. We consider massless scalar field,
meant to mimic perturbations of inflaton and/or gravitational field, in this
background. At three-momenta below $k$, there exists a zero mode localized on
the brane, whose behaviour coincides with that in four-dimensional theory. On
the contrary, at three-momenta above $k$, the localized mode is absent and
physics is entirely five-dimensional. As three-momenta get redshifted, more
modes get localized on the brane, the phenomenon analogous to ``mode
generation''. We find that for $k\gg H$, where $H$ is the inflationary Hubble
scale, the spectrum of perturbations coincides with that in four-dimensional
theory. For $k < H$ and time-dependent bulk parameters, the spectrum deviates,
possibly strongly, from the flat spectrum even for pure de Sitter inflation.",2005-04-11T17:55:29Z
Strange stars and superbursts at near-Eddington mass accretion rates,"Careful assessment of four good superburst candidates for GX 17+2 reveals
that superburst is possible at near Eddington mass accretion rates. For the
other seven stars, where superburst is found, there is the standard model of
burning accumulated carbon from normal type I bursts of the accreting stars.
However, there is the need for carbon, nitrogen and oxygen mass fraction
(Z_{CNO}) which must be larger than Z_{CNO,\odot}, where the latter refers to
the standard value found in the sun. Also it is very difficult to incorporate
GX 17+2 into the standard picture of superbursts. In case of superbursts from
strange stars, arising from broken quark pairs going over to diquarks at the
surface of the star, these problems do not arise. Furthermore there is a
natural explanation for the large value of ~ 1000 for \alpha which is defined
in the literature as the ratio of energy released between normal bursts to the
energy released during the normal burst. In the scenario for superbursts in
strange stars it may be argued that the relatively smaller value of \alpha of ~
440 indicates frequent recurrence of superbursts which is reflected in 4U
1636-53.",2005-04-13T09:20:16Z
A low-absorption disk zone at low Galactic latitude in Centaurus,"We investigate the properties of two stellar concentrations in a
low-absorption disk zone in Centaurus, located respectively at
$\ell=306.47^{\circ}$, $b=-0.61 ^{\circ}$, and $\ell=307.01^{\circ}$, $b=-0.74
^{\circ}$. The present analysis is based mostly on 2MASS photometry, as well as
optical photometry. Based on colour-magnitude diagrams and stellar radial
density profiles, we show that these concentrations are not open star clusters.
Instead, they appear to be field stars seen through a differentially-reddened
window. We estimate that the bulk of the stars in both stellar concentrations
is located at $\sim1.5$ kpc from the Sun, a distance consistent with that of
the Sgr-Car arm in that direction. This low-absorption window allows one to
probe into distant parts of the disk besides the Sgr-Car arm, probably the
tangent part of the Sct-Cru arm, and/or the far side of the Sgr-Car arm in that
direction. The main sequence associated to the Sgr-Car arm is reddened by
$\ebv\sim0.5$, so that this window through the disk is comparable in reddening
to Baade's window to the bulge. We also investigate the nature of the open
cluster candidate Ru 166. The presently available data do not allow us to
conclude whether Ru 166 is an actual open cluster or field stars seen through a
small-scale low-absorption window.",2005-04-01T17:18:09Z
"Radiative transfer problem in dusty galaxies: iteration scaling
  approximation","We investigate the applicability and accuracy of the iteration scaling
approximation, proposed by Kylafis and Bahcall (1987). It is shown, that while
this method provides results sufficiently close to the exact solution of
radiative transfer problem, care must be taken in cases when the distribution
of interstellar dust significantly differs from that of light sources. The
problem is successfully circumvented by using the ratio of scattered light
distributions obtained in the first two iterations.",2005-04-27T19:45:33Z
Secular Evolution of Galaxies,"In current $\Lambda$CDM galaxy formation scenarios, at least three physical
phenomena could contribute to the mass assembly: monolithic collapse,
hierarchical mergers and more quiescent external gas accretion, with secular
evolution. The three processes are described, and their successes and problems
are reviewed. It is shown that monolithic collapse is likely to be quite
restricted to sub-components of galaxies, while the two main scenarii,
hierarchical merging and secular evolution, might have comparable roles,
depending on environment. Evidences are reviewed for the important role of gas
accretion, followed by secular evolution. In particular the existence of thin
and cold disks, the occurence of bars and spiral structure, the frequency of
lopsided instabilities, and the history of star formation, all point towards
large amounts of cold gas accretion. Some examples of N-body simulations are
reviewed in support of secular evolution.",2005-06-13T09:19:49Z
Correlation of Low z Lyman-alpha Absorbers with HI-selected Galaxies,"In this work, observational evidence for the connection between low column
density Lyman-alpha absorbers and large-scale structure traced by gas-rich
galaxies is investigated. The HI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS) galaxy
catalogue is cross-correlated with known low redshift, low column density
Lyman-alpha absorbers from the literature. The absorber-galaxy
cross-correlation function shows that on scales from 1 to 10 h^-1 Mpc,
absorbers are imbedded in halos with masses similar to that of galaxy groups.
This statistical evidence suggests that galaxy groups could be the dominant
environment of low column density Lyman-alpha absorbers at z=0.",2005-04-22T13:36:00Z
Fast identification of transits from light-curves,"We present an algorithm that allows fast and efficient detection of transits,
including planetary transits, from light-curves. The method is based on
building an ensemble of fiducial models and compressing the data using the
MOPED algorithm. We describe the method and demonstrate its efficiency by
finding planet-like transits in simulated Pan-STARRS light-curves. We show that
that our method is independent of the size of the search space of transit
parameters. In large sets of light-curves, we achieve speed up factors of order
of $10^{8}$ times over the full $\chi2$ search. We discuss how the algorithm
can be used in forthcoming large surveys like Pan-STARRS and LSST and how it
may be optimized for future space missions like Kepler and COROT where most of
the processing must be done on board.",2005-02-15T21:04:55Z
Long-term Periodicities in the Flux from Low Mass X-ray Binaries,"Using data from the All Sky Monitor (ASM) on the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer
(RXTE) we have searched for long term periodicities in the X-ray flux of GX
1+4, Sco X-2 (GX 349+2), and GX 339-4. For GX 1+4 we also used data from BATSE
and Galactic Centre scans performed by RXTE. We find no evidence for X-ray
modulations at the suggested ~304 d orbital period of GX 1+4. However, we find
tentative evidence for a periodicity at 420 d to 460 d. An upper limit of 15%
peak-to-peak is set on any sinusoidal modulation in the 1.5 - 3.0 keV flux of
Sco X-2 for periods in the 30 to 100 d range. For GX 339-4 we confirm the Low
State modulation and report the detection of significant low-frequency
modulations in both the High State and Very High State. We fail to detect this
modulation in the Off State. We show that if the reported orbital period of GX
339-4 lies in the range 0.5 - 1.7 d, then it is not present in the RXTE ASM
light curve.",2005-04-05T01:15:34Z
"Discovery of X-Ray Emission from Supernova 1970G with Chandra: Filling
  the Void between Supernovae and Supernova Remnants","We report on the discovery of X-ray emission from SN 1970G in M101, 35 years
after its outburst, using deep X-ray imaging with the Chandra X-ray
observatory. The Chandra ACIS spectrum shows that the emission is soft (<2 keV)
and characteristic for the reverse shock region. The X-ray luminosity (1 x
10^37 ergs/s) is likely caused by the interaction of the supernova (SN) shock
with dense circumstellar matter. If the material was deposited by the stellar
wind from the progenitor, a mass-loss rate of (2.6+/-0.4) x 10^-5 M_sun/year is
inferred. Utilizing the high-resolution Chandra ACIS data of SN 1970G and its
environment, we reconstruct the X-ray lightcurve from previous ROSAT HRI, PSPC,
and XMM-Newton EPIC observations, and find a best-fit linear rate of decline of
L \propto t^-s with index s = 1.7+/-0.6 over a period of 12-35 years after the
outburst. As the oldest SN detected in X-rays, SN 1970G allows, for the first
time, direct observation of the transition from a SN to its supernova remnant
(SNR) phase.",2005-06-01T17:04:32Z

relationship between its HI morphology and kinematics to past and present star
formation. Optically, it is a small (R_25 = 990 pc), faint (M_B of -14.0) Im
with a slightly boxy shape. In HI, DDO 43 has an extended (R_HI/R_Ho = 2.8) gas
envelope. There is a high density ridge associated with the optical body of the
galaxy, containing several higher density knots and lower density holes. The
largest hole is ~850x530 pc. No expansion is detected, so it must be relatively
old. The largest and potentially oldest (7-70 Myr) of the six identified star
clusters is located at the western edge of the hole. Four of the other clusters
are located near high density peaks. There are several HII regions, most of
which are associated with peaks in the HI surface density. The overall star
formation rate is average for its type. In many ways, DDO 43 is a very typical
dwarf irregular galaxy. Its HI morphology is consistent with a history of
episodes of localized star ormation that create holes and shells in the ISM,
some of which can overlap. These features are located within the area of
solid-body rotation in the galaxy; the lack of shear in these small systems
allows such structures to persist for long periods of time.",2005-06-06T16:07:38Z
"Morphology of low-redshift compact galaxy clusters I. Shapes and radial
  profiles","The morphology of clusters of galaxies may be described with a set of
parameters which contain information about the formation and evolutionary
history of these systems. In this paper we present a preliminary study of the
morphological parameters of a sample of 28 compact Abell clusters extracted
from DPOSS data. The morphology of galaxy clusters is parameterized by their
apparent ellipticity, position angle of the major axis, centre coordinates,
core radius and beta-model power law index. Our procedure provides estimates of
these parameters by simultaneously fitting them all, overcoming some of the
difficulties induced by sparse data and low number statistics typical of this
kind of analysis. The cluster parameters were fitted in a 3 x 3 h^-2 sqMpc
region, measuring the background in a 2 <R< 2.5 h^-1Mpc annulus. We also
explore the correlations between shape and profile parameters and other cluster
properties. One third of this compact cluster sample has core radii smaller
than 50 h^-1 kpc, i.e. near the limit that our data allow us to resolve,
possibly consistent with cusped models. The remaining clusters span a broad
range of core radii up to 750 h^-1 kpc. More than 80 per cent of this sample
has ellipticity higher than 0.2. The alignment between the cluster and the
major axis of the dominant galaxy is confirmed, while no correlation is
observed with other bright cluster members. No significant correlation is found
between cluster richness and ellipticity. Instead, cluster richness is found to
correlate, albeit with large scatter, with the cluster core radius.[abridged]",2005-02-03T10:32:50Z
"Optical Spectroscopy of the Surface Population of the rho Ophiuchi
  Molecular Cloud: The First Wave of Star Formation","We present the results of optical spectroscopy of 139 stars obtained with the
Hydra multi-object spectrograph. The objects extend over a 1.3 square degree
area surrounding the main cloud of the rho Oph complex. The objects were
selected from narrowband images to have H alpha in emission. Using the presence
of strong H alpha emission, lithium absorption, location in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, or previously reported x-ray emission, we were
able to identify 88 objects as young stars associated with the cloud. Strong H
alpha emission was confirmed in 39 objects with line widths consistent with
their origin in magnetospheric accretion columns. Two of the strongest
emission-line objects are young, x-ray emitting brown dwarf candidates with M8
spectral types. Comparisons of the bolometric luminosities and effective
temperatures with theoretical models suggest a medianage for this population of
2.1 Myr which is signifcantly older than the ages derived for objects in the
cloud core. It appears that these stars formed contemporaneously with low mass
stars in the Upper Scorpius subgroup, likely triggered by massive stars in the
Upper-Centaurus subgroup.",2005-06-10T22:01:57Z
"X-ray Observations of the Boundary Layer in Dwarf Novae at Low Accretion
  Rates","We present a spectral analysis of XMM-Newton data of ten dwarf novae, nine of
which were observed during a quiescent state. The X-ray spectra indicate the
presence of a hot, optically thin plasma with a temperature distribution
consistent with a simple, isobaric cooling flow. The likely origin of the X-ray
emission is cooling plasma in the boundary layer settling onto the white dwarf.
Using a cooling flow model, we derive the temperatures, accretion rates,
rotational velocities, and elemental abundances of the X-ray emitting gas. We
discuss the implications of our findings for the structure of the boundary
layer. A comparison of X-ray and ultraviolet luminosities finds no evidence of
underluminous boundary layers in any of the quiescent dwarf novae. The X-ray
spectrum of EI UMa differs significantly from those of the other objects,
showing a strong fluorescent Fe K-alpha line and a strong O VII line triplet.
Based on the observational evidence, we argue that EI UMa is most likely an
intermediate polar and not as previously thought a dwarf nova.",2005-03-04T21:52:06Z
The Gas Content in Galactic Disks: Correlation with Kinematics,"We consider the relationship between the total HI mass in late-type galaxies
and the kinematic properties of their disks. The mass $M_HI$ for galaxies with
a wide variety of properties, from dwarf dIrr galaxies with active star
formation to giant low-brightness galaxies, is shown to correlate with the
product $V_c R_0$ ($V_c$ is the rotational velocity, and $R_0$ is the radial
photometric disks scale length), which characterizes the specific angular
momentum of the disk. This relationship, along with the anticorrelation between
the relative mass of HI in a galaxy and $V_c$, can be explained in terms of the
previously made assumption that the gas density in the disks of most galaxies
is maintained at a level close to the threshold (marginal) stability of a
gaseous layer to local gravitational perturbations. In this case, the
regulation mechanism of the star formation rate associated with the growth of
local gravitational instability in the gaseous layer must play a crucial role
in the evolution of the gas content in the galactic disk.",2005-05-13T14:22:50Z
On the Absorption and Emission Properties of Interstellar Grains,"Our current understanding of the absorption and emission properties of
interstellar grains are reviewed. The constraints placed by the Kramers-Kronig
relation on the wavelength-dependence and the maximum allowable quantity of the
dust absorption are discussed. Comparisons of the opacities (mass absorption
coefficients) derived from interstellar dust models with those directly
estimated from observations are presented.",2005-03-25T21:08:51Z
The Intrinsic Properties of SMMJ14011+0252,"We discuss the properties of the bright submillimeter source SMMJ14011+0252
at z=2.56 which lies behind the central regions of the z=0.25 lensing cluster
A1835. This system has a complex optical morphology consisting of at least five
separate components. We reassess the extensive multiwavelength observations of
this system and find strong support for the suggestion that one of these five
components represents a foreground galaxy. The spectral and morphological
properties of the foreground galaxy indicate that it is a low-luminosity,
passive early-type disk member of the A1835 cluster. We estimate the likely
properties of the dark matter halo of this galaxy from its stellar
distribution. Based on these estimates we suggest that, contrary to earlier
claims, this foreground galaxy is unlikely to significantly magnify the
background submillimeter source. Thus SMMJ14011+0252 probably represents an
intrinsically luminous submillimeter galaxy.",2005-06-08T19:11:41Z
"The effective temperature scale of FGK stars. I. Determination of
  temperatures and angular diameters with the infrared flux method","The infrared flux method (IRFM) has been applied to a sample of 135 dwarf and
36 giant stars covering the following regions of the atmospheric parameters
space: 1) the metal-rich ([Fe/H]>0) end (consisting mostly of planet-hosting
stars), 2) the cool (Teff<5000 K) metal-poor (-1<[Fe/H]<-3) dwarf region, and
3) the very metal-poor ([Fe/H]<-2.5) end. These stars were especially selected
to cover gaps in previous works on Teff vs. color relations, particularly the
IRFM Teff scale of A. Alonso and collaborators. Our IRFM implementation was
largely based on the Alonso et al. study (absolute infrared flux calibration,
bolometric flux calibration, etc.) with the aim of extending the ranges of
applicability of their Teff vs. color calibrations. In addition, in order to
improve the internal accuracy of the IRFM Teff scale, we recomputed the
temperatures of almost all stars from the Alonso et al. work using updated
input data. The updated temperatures do not significantly differ from the
original ones, with few exceptions, leaving the Teff scale of Alonso et al.
mostly unchanged. Including the stars with updated temperatures, a large sample
of 580 dwarf and 470 giant stars (in the field and in clusters), which cover
the ranges: 3600 K<Teff<8000 K, -4.0<[Fe/H]<+0.5, have Teff homogeneously
determined with the IRFM. (Abridged)",2005-03-04T19:56:32Z
Simulating Gaia performances on white dwarfs,"One of the most promising space missions of ESA is the astrometric satellite
Gaia, which will provide very precise astrometry and multicolour photometry,
for all 1.3 billion objects to V~20, and radial velocities with accuracies of a
few km/s for most stars brighter than V ~ 17. Consequently, full homogeneous
six-dimensional phase-space information for a huge number of stars will become
available. Our Monte Carlo simulator has been used to estimate the number of
white dwarfs potentially observable by Gaia. From this we assess which would be
the white dwarf luminosity functions which Gaia will obtain and discuss in
depth the scientific returns of Gaia in the specific field of white dwarf
populations. Scientific attainable goals include, among others, a reliable
determination of the age of the Galactic disk, a better knowledge of the halo
of the Milky Way and the reconstruction of the star formation history of the
Galactic disk. Our results also demonstrate the potential impact of a mission
like Gaia in the current understanding of the white dwarf cooling theory.",2005-04-19T12:02:41Z
Force-Free Magnetosphere of an Accreting Kerr Black Hole,"I consider a stationary axisymmetric force-free degenerate magnetosphere of a
rotating Kerr black hole surrounded by a thin Keplerian infinitely-conducting
accretion disk. I focus on the closed-field geometry with a direct magnetic
coupling between the disk and the event horizon. I first present a simple
physical argument that shows how the black hole's rotation limits the radial
extent of the force-free link. I then confirm this result by solving
numerically the general-relativistic force-free Grad--Shafranov equation in the
magnetosphere, using the regularity condition at the inner light cylinder to
determine the poloidal current. I indeed find that force-free solutions exist
only when the magnetic link between the hole and the disk has a limited extent
on the disk surface. I chart out the maximum allowable size of this
magnetically-connected part of the disk as a function of the black hole spin. I
also compute the angular momentum and energy transfer between the hole and the
disk that takes place via the direct magnetic link. I find that both of these
quantities grow rapidly and that their deposition becomes highly concentrated
near the inner edge of the disk as the black hole spin is increased.",2005-03-23T22:14:22Z
"Runaway electromagnetic cascade in shear flows and high energy radiation
  of astrophysical jets","We propose a straightforward and efficient mechanism of the high energy
emission of astrophysical jets associated with an exchange of interacting high
energy photons between the jet and external environment and vice versa.
Interactions which play the main role in this mechanism, are e^+ e^- pair
production by photons and inverse Compton scattering. The process has been
studied with numerical simulations demonstrating that under reasonable
conditions it has a supercritical character: high energy photons breed
exponentially being fed directly by the bulk kinetic energy of the jet.
Eventually, there is a feedback of particles on the fluid dynamics and the jet
partially decelerates.",2005-06-15T17:02:48Z
Relic Gravitational Waves and the Evolution of the Universe,"In the inflation models, the relic gravitational waves (RGW) generated in the
inflation stage, and evolved in the Universe until now. In the different
cosmological evolution models, one can get different gravitational waves power
spectrum. In this paper, we give a simple formula to estimate this spectrum in
a general cosmological model. From this formula, one can easily find the
relation between this power spectrum and the cosmological evolution models. The
spectrum includes all the information about the evolution of the scale factor
$a$ from inflation to now.
  So RGW is a more clear fossil, which records the cosmological evolution
information, and be a useful complementarity for another fossil$-$Cosmic
  Microwave Background Radiation (CMB).",2005-05-30T04:29:13Z
Stability properties of some perfect fluid cosmological models,"Flat FRW perfect fluid cosmologies can be reproduced as particular solutions
of suitable field theoretical models. Here we investigate the stability of
perfect fluid model trajectories with respect to sets of trajectories of the
corresponding field models having generic initial conditions. It is shown that
the trajectories of barotropic perfect fluid models and those of the Chaplygin
gas model are stable. The total probability to reach the Chaplygin gas regime
early enough to achieve a matter dominated stage having a realistic duration is
calculated for a scalar field model assuming a natural measure in the space of
initial conditions taken near a cosmological singularity. An example is
presented of a two-fluid cosmological model where the stability is partially
absent.",2005-04-26T17:03:25Z
The Progenitor of Supernova 2004dj in a Star Cluster,"The progenitor of type II-plateau supernova (SN) 2004dj is identified with a
supergiant in a compact star cluster known as ""Sandage Star 96"" (S96) in the
nearby spiral galaxy NGC 2403, which was fortuitously imaged as part of the
Beijing-Arizona-Taiwan-Connecticut (BATC) Multicolor Sky Survey from Feb 1995
to Dec 2003 prior to SN 2004dj. The superior photometry of BATC images for S96,
taken with 14 intermediate-band filters covering 3000-10000\AA, unambiguously
establishes the star cluster nature of S96 with an age of $\sim 20$Myr, a
reddening of $\hbox{E}(B-V)\sim 0.35$ mag and a total mass of $\sim
96,000$M$_{\odot}$. The compact star cluster nature of S96 is also consistent
with the lack of light variations in the past decade. The SN progenitor is
estimated to have a main-sequence mass of $\sim$12M$_{\odot}$. The comparison
of our intermediate-band data of S96 with the post-outburst photometry obtained
as the SN has significantly dimmed, may hopefully conclusively establish the
nature of the progenitor.",2005-05-14T01:22:06Z
"Sgr A East as a possible high energy neutron factory in the Galactic
  Centre","Sgr A East is a supernova remnant located within few parsecs from the
Galactic Centre (GC). There are good reasons to believe that this object is the
source of the gamma-ray excess detected by HESS in the direction of the GC
meaning that Sgr A East is likely to be an efficient Cosmic Ray accelerator.
Some observations suggest that strong magnetic fields may be present in that
region allowing the acceleration of composite nuclei in Sgr A East beyond the
EeV. We show that, if this is case, EeV neutrons should be effectively produced
by the photo-disintegration of Ultra High Energy nuclei onto the IR photon
background (with temperature $\sim 40$ K) in which Sgr A East is embedded.
  Neutrons with such an energy can reach the Earth before decaying and may be
detectable under the form of a CR point-like excess in the direction of the GC.
  We determine the expected energy spectrum and the amplitude of this signal
showing that it may be measurable by the AUGER observatory.",2005-04-14T12:56:35Z
"An unexpectedly rapid decline in the X-ray afterglow emission of long
  gamma-ray bursts","Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are commonly accepted to originate in the
explosion of particularly massive stars, which gives rise to a highly
relativistic jet. Internal inhomogeneities in the expanding flow give rise to
internal shock waves that are believed to produce the gamma-rays we see. As the
jet travels further outward into the surrounding circumstellar medium
`external' shocks give rise to the afterglow emission seen in the X-ray,
optical and radio bands. Here we report on the early phases of the X-ray
emission of five GRBs. Their X-ray light curves are characterised by a rapid
fall-off for the first few hundred seconds, followed by a less rapid decline
lasting several hours. This steep decline, together with detailed spectral
properties of two particular bursts, shows that violent shock interactions take
place in the early jet outflows.",2005-06-16T13:08:38Z
"266 E+A Galaxies Selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release
  2: The Origin of E+A Galaxies","E+A galaxies are characterized as a galaxy with strong Balmer absorption
lines but without any [OII] nor H$\alpha$ emission lines. The existence of
strong Balmer absorption lines indicates that E+A galaxies have experienced
starburst within recent one Gyr. However, the lack of [OII] and H$\alpha$
emission lines indicates that E+A galaxies do not have any on-going star
formation. Therefore, E+A galaxies are interpreted as a post-starburst galaxy.
For many years, however, it has been a mystery why E+A galaxies started
starburst and why they quenched the star formation abruptly.
  Using one of the largest samples of 266 E+A galaxies carefully selected from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 2, we have investigated the
environment of E+A galaxies from 50 kpc to 8 Mpc scale, i.e., from a typical
distance to satellite galaxies to the scale of large scale structures. We found
that E+A galaxies have excess of local galaxy density only at a scale of $<100$
kpc (with a two $\sigma$ significance), but not at the cluster scale ($\sim$1.5
Mpc) nor in the scale of large scale structure ($\sim$8 Mpc). These results
indicate that E+A galaxies are not created by the physical mechanisms
associated with galaxy clusters or the large scale structure, but are likely to
be created by the dynamical interaction with closely accompanying galaxies at a
$<$100 kpc scale. The claim is also supported by the morphology of E+A
galaxies. We have found that almost all E+A galaxies have a bright compact
core, and that $\sim$30% of E+A galaxies have dynamically disturbed signatures
or the tidal tails, being quite suggestive of morphological appearance of
merger/interaction remnants.",2005-03-03T21:00:20Z
Are quasar jets dominated by Poynting flux?,"The formation of relativistic astrophysical jets is presumably mediated by
magnetic fields threading accretion disks and central, rapidly rotating
objects. As it is accelerated by magnetic stresses, the jet's kinetic energy
flux grows at the expense of its Poynting flux. However, it is unclear how
efficient is the conversion from magnetic to kinetic energy and whether there
are any observational signatures of this process. We address this issue in the
context of jets in quasars. Using data from all spatial scales, we demonstrate
that in these objects the conversion from Poynting-flux-dominated to
matter-dominated jets is very likely to take place closer to the black hole
than the region where most of the Doppler boosted radiation observed in blazars
is produced. We briefly discuss the possibility that blazar activity can be
induced by global MHD instabilities, e.g., via the production of localized
velocity gradients that lead to dissipative events such as shocks or magnetic
reconnection, where acceleration of relativistic particles and production of
non-thermal flares is taking place.",2005-02-05T00:47:26Z
"Laboratory Measurement and Theoretical Modeling of K-shell X-ray Lines
  from Inner-shell Excited and Ionized Ions of Oxygen","We present high resolution laboratory spectra of K-shell X-ray lines from
inner-shell excited and ionized ions of oxygen, obtained with a reflection
grating spectrometer on the electron beam ion trap (EBIT-I) at the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory. Only with a multi-ion model including all major
atomic collisional and radiative processes, are we able to identify the
observed K-shell transitions of oxygen ions from \ion{O}{3} to \ion{O}{6}. The
wavelengths and associated errors for some of the strongest transitions are
given, taking into account both the experimental and modeling uncertainties.
The present data should be useful in identifying the absorption features
present in astrophysical sources, such as active galactic nuclei and X-ray
binaries. They are also useful in providing benchmarks for the testing of
theoretical atomic structure calculations.",2005-03-30T16:38:09Z
"Exploring Cosmological Expansion Parametrizations with the Gold SnIa
  Dataset","We use the SnIa Gold dataset to compare LCDM with 10 representative
parametrizations of the recent Hubble expansion history $H(z)$. For the
comparison we use two statistical tests; the usual $\chi_{min}^2$ which is
insensitive to the parametrization number of parameters, and a statistic we
call the p-test which depends on both the value of $\chi_{min}^2$ and the
number $n$ of the parametrization parameters. The p-test measures the
confidence level to which the parameter values corresponding to LCDM are
excluded from the viewpoint of the parametrization tested. For example, for a
linear equation of state parametrization $w(z)=w_0 + w_1 z$ the LCDM parameter
values ($w_0=-1$, $w_1=0$) are excluded at 75% confidence level. We use a flat
prior and $\Omega_{0m}=0.3$. All parametrizations tested are consistent with
the Gold dataset at their best fit. According to both statistical tests, the
worst fits among the 10 parametrizations, correspond to the Chaplygin gas, the
brane world and the Cardassian parametrizations. The best fit is achieved by
oscillating parametrizations which can exclude the parameter values
corresponding to LCDM at 85% confidence level. Even though this level of
significance does not provide a statistically significant exclusion of LCDM (it
is less than $2\sigma$) and does not by itself constitute conclusive evidence
for oscillations in the cosmological expansion, when combined with similar
independent recent evidence for oscillations coming from the CMB and matter
power spectra it becomes an issue worth of further investigation.",2005-03-09T21:03:29Z
OH 12.8-0.9: A New Water-Fountain Source,"We present observational evidence that the OH/IR star OH 12.8-0.9 is the
fourth in a class of objects previously dubbed ""water-fountain"" sources. Using
the Very Long Baseline Array, we produced the first images of the water maser
emission associated with OH 12.8-0.9. We find that the masers are located in
two compact regions with an angular separation of ~109 mas on the sky. The axis
of separation between the two maser regions is at a position angle of 1.5 deg.
East of North with the blue-shifted (-80.5 to -85.5 km/s) masers located to the
North and the red-shifted (-32.0 to -35.5 km/s) masers to the South. In
addition, we find that the blue- and red-shifted masers are distributed along
arc-like structures ~10-12 mas across oriented roughly perpendicular to the
separation axis. The morphology exhibited by the water masers is suggestive of
an axisymmetric wind with the masers tracing bow shocks formed as the wind
impacts the ambient medium. This bipolar jet-like structure is typical of the
three other confirmed water-fountain sources. When combined with the previously
observed spectral characteristics of OH 12.8-0.9, the observed spatio-kinematic
structure of the water masers provides strong evidence that OH 12.8-0.9 is
indeed a member of the water-fountain class.",2005-05-31T19:04:03Z
Triggered Star Formation in the Orion Bright-Rimmed Clouds,"We have developed an empirical and effective set of criteria, based on the
2MASS colors, to select candidate classical T Tauri stars (CTTS). This provides
a useful tool to study the young stellar population in star-forming regions.
Here we present our analysis of the bright-rimmed clouds (BRCs) B 35, B 30, IC
2118, LDN 1616, LDN 1634, and Orion East to show how massive stars interact
with molecular clouds to trigger star formation. Our results support the
radiation-driven implosion model in which the ionization fronts from OB stars
compress a nearby cloud until the local density exceeds the critical value,
thereby inducing the cloud to collapse to form stars. We find that only BRCs
associated with strong IRAS 100 micron emission (tracer of high density) and
H-alpha emission (tracer of ionization fronts) show signs of ongoing star
formation. Relevant timescales, including the ages of O stars, expanding HII
regions, and the ages of CTTS, are consistent with sequential star formation.
We also find that CTTS are only seen between the OB stars and the BRCs, with
those closer to the BRCs being progressively younger. There are no CTTS leading
the ionization fronts, i.e., within the molecular clouds. All these provide
strong evidence of triggered star formation and show the major roles massive
stars play in sustaining the star-forming activities in the region.",2005-02-03T09:26:12Z
"Dependence of the non-linear mass power spectrum on the equation of
  state of dark energy","We present N-body simulation calculations of the dependence of the power
spectrum of non-linear cosmological mass density fluctuations on the equation
of state of the dark energy, w=p/rho. At fixed linear theory power, increasing
w leads to an increase in non-linear power, with the effect increasing with k.
By k=10 h/Mpc, a model with w=-0.75 has ~12% more power than a standard
cosmological constant model (w=-1), while a model with w=-0.5 has ~33% extra
power (at z=0). The size of the effect increases with increasing dark energy
fraction, and to a lesser extent increasing power spectrum normalization, but
is insensitive to the power spectrum shape (the numbers above are for
Omega_m=0.281 and sigma_8=0.897). A code quantifying the non-linear effect of
varying w, as a function of k, z, and other cosmological parameters, which
should be accurate to a few percent for k<10 h/Mpc for models that fit the
current observations, is available at
http://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~pmcdonal/code.html. This paper also serves as an
example of a detailed exploration of the numerical convergence properties of
ratios of power spectra for different models, which can be useful because some
kinds of numerical error cancel in a ratio. When precision calculations based
on numerical simulations are needed for many different models, efficiency may
be gained by breaking the problem into a calculation of the absolute prediction
at a central point, and calculations of the relative change in the prediction
with model parameters.",2005-05-27T18:38:23Z
How is Binary Radio-Pulsars with Black Holes Population Rich?,"Using ""Scenario Machine"" we have carried out population synthesis of radio
pulsar with black hole binaries (BH+Psr) in context of the most wide
assumptions about star mass loss during evolution, binary stars mass ratio
distribution, kick velocity and envelope mass lost during collapse. Our purpose
is to display that under any suppositional parameters of evolution scenario
BH+Psr population have to be abundant in Galaxy. It is shown that in the all
models including models evolved by Heger et al. (2002), Woosley et al. (2002),

Cosmic ray transport in MHD turbulence,"Recent advances in understanding of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence call
for revisions in the picture of cosmic ray transport. In this paper we use
recently obtained scaling laws for MHD modes to obtain the scattering frequency
for cosmic rays. We account for the turbulence cutoff arising from both
collisional and collisionless damping. We obtain the scattering rate and show
that fast modes provide the dominant contribution to cosmic ray scattering for
the typical interstellar conditions in spite of the fact that fast modes are
subjected to damping. We determine how the efficiency of the scattering depends
on the characteristics of ionized media, e.g. plasma $\beta$. We show that
streaming instability is suppressed by the ambient MHD turbulence.",2005-05-28T23:11:15Z
An HST Search for Supernovae Accompanying X-ray Flashes,"We present the results from an Hubble Space Telescope/ACS search for
supernovae associated with X-ray flashes 020903, 040701, 040812 and 040916. We
find strong evidence that XRF 020903 (z=0.25) was associated with a SN
1998bw-like supernova and confirm this using optical spectroscopy at t ~ 25
days. We find no evidence, however, for SN 1998bw-like supernovae associated
with the other three events. In the case of XRF 040701 (z=0.21), we rule out
even a faint supernova similar to SN 2002ap, using template light-curves for
several local Type Ic supernovae. For the two cases in which the redshift is
not known, XRFs 040812 and 040916, we derive robust redshift limits assuming
they were accompanied by supernovae similar to SN 1998bw and compare these
limits with photometric redshift constraints provided by their host galaxies.
We supplement this analysis with results for three additional events (XRFs
011030, 020427 and 030723) and discuss the observed diversity of supernovae
associated with X-ray flashes and gamma-ray bursts. We conclude that XRF-SNe
exist, but can be significantly fainter than SN 1998bw, possibly consistent
with the observed spread in local Type Ibc supernovae.",2005-02-25T22:49:44Z
Aldebaran's angular diameter: how well do we know it?,"The bright, well-known K5 giant Aldebaran, alpha Tau, is probably the star
with the largest number of direct angular diameter determinations, achieved
over a long time by several authors using various techniques. In spite of this
wealth of data, or perhaps as a direct result of it, there is not a very good
agreement on a single angular diameter value. This is particularly unsettling
if one considers that Aldebaran is also used as a primary calibrator for some
angular resolution methods, notably for optical and infrared long baseline
interferometry. Directly connected to Aldebaran's angular diameter and its
uncertainties is its effective temperature, which also has been used for
several empirical calibrations. Among the proposed explanations for the
elusiveness of an accurate determination of the angular diameter of Aldebaran
are the possibility of temporal variations as well as a possible dependence of
the angular diameter on the wavelength. We present here a few, very accurate
new determinations obtained by means of lunar occultations and long baseline
interferometry. We derive an average value of 19.96+-0.03 milliarcseconds for
the uniform disk diameter. The corresponding limb-darkened value is 20.58+-0.03
milliarcseconds, or 44.2+-0.9 R(sun). We discuss this result, in connection
with previous determinations and with possible problems that may affect such
measurements.",2005-02-09T11:26:14Z
"Mass estimates from stellar proper motions: The mass of $ω$

to best determine the mass of stellar clusters from proper motion data. Both
methods effectively account and correct for errors in the velocities, and
provide an unbiased and robust estimate of the cluster mass. Using an extensive
proper motion study of $\omega$ Centauri by van Leeuwen et al. (2000), we
estimate the mass of $\omega$ Centauri using these two different methods to be
$2.8 \times 10^{6} M_{\odot} \left[d/5.1 kpc\right]^{3}$. Within this modeling
context, the statistical error is $3\%$ and the systematic error is $4\%$.",2005-03-14T18:53:04Z
Discrete Quantum Spectrum of Observable Correlations from Inflation,"The decoherence of quantum fluctuations into classical perturbations during
inflation is discussed. A simple quantum mechanical argument, using a spatial
particle wavefunction rather than a field description, shows that observable
correlations from inflation must have a discrete spectrum, since they originate
and freeze into the metric within a compact region. The number of discrete
modes is estimated using a holographic bound on the number of degrees of
freedom. The discreteness may be detectable in some models; for example, if
there is a fundamental universal frequency spectrum, the inflationary
gravitational wave background may be resolvable into discrete emission lines.",2005-04-16T21:14:39Z
"3D ISM-Shock Spectral Emission: X-ray models for Radio Galaxy SED
  Modeling","Galaxies form out of small fluctuations in a smoothly expanding Universe.
However, the initial gravitational collapse phase is accompanied by the
formation of supermassive black holes and clusters of massive stars. Black
holes and star clusters generate powerful outflows in the form of jets and
superwinds that interact with still infalling gas, possibly regulating the
galaxy formation process, initiating new sites of star formation, and carrying
chemically enriched gas to the intergalactic medium. Unfortunately, beyond this
qualitative description our detailed theoretical understanding is poor.
  New results from 3D simulations of a GPS/CSS galaxy, with gravitational
potentials included, shed some new light on the jet driven outflow process in
particular. New code capabilites to predict detailed X-ray spectra from
multi-dimensional time-dependent dynamics simulations of Galaxy Feedback, and
will be useful for future interpretation of X-ray and radio SEDs of forming
galaxies.",2005-02-17T04:53:52Z
"On the viability of neutron star black hole binaries as central engines
  of gamma-ray bursts","I discuss three-dimensional SPH simulations of neutron star black hole
encounters. The calculations are performed using a nuclear equation of state
and a multi-flavor neutrino treatment, general relativistic effects are
mimicked using the Paczynski-Wiita pseudo-potential and gravitational radiation
reaction forces. Most of the explored mass range (14 to 20 \msun) has not been
considered before in numerical simulations. The neutron star is always
disrupted during the first approach after most of its mass has been transferred
directly into the hole. In none of the analyzed cases episodic mass transfer is
found. If an accretion disk forms at all, it is relatively cold ($T < 2.5$
MeV), of only moderate density ($\rho \sim 10^{10}$ g/ccm) and substantially
consumed by the hole on the simulation time scale of a few milliseconds. None
of the investigated systems of this study yields conditions that are promising
to launch a GRB. While we cannot completely exclude that a subset of neutron
star black hole binaries, maybe black holes with low masses and very large
initial spins, can produce a GRB, this seems to happen -if at all- only in a
restricted region of the available parameter space. I argue that the difficulty
to form promising disks together with the absence of any observed neutron star
black hole binary may mean that they are insignificant as central engines of
the observed, short-hard GRBs and that the vast majority of the latter ones is
caused by double neutron star coalescences.",2005-04-30T14:42:40Z
Optimal Estimation of Non-Gaussianity,"We systematically analyze the primordial non-Gaussianity estimator used by
the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) science team with the basic
ideas of estimation theory in order to see if the limited Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) data is being optimally utilized. The WMAP estimator is based
on the implicit assumption that the CMB bispectrum, the harmonic transform of
the three-point correlation function, contains all of the primordial
non-Gaussianity information in a CMB map. We first demonstrate that the
Signal-to-Noise (S/N) of an estimator based on CMB three-point correlation
functions is significantly larger than the S/N of any estimator based on
higher-order correlation functions; justifying our choice to focus on the
three-point correlation function. We then conclude that the estimator based on
the three-point correlation function, which was used by WMAP, is optimal,
meaning it saturates the Cramer-Rao Inequality when the underlying CMB map is
nearly Gaussian. We quantify this restriction by demonstrating that the
suboptimal character of our estimator is proportonal to the square of the
fiducial non-Gaussianity, which is already constrained to be extremely small,
so we can consider the WMAP estimator to be optimal in practice. Our
conclusions do not depend on the form of the primordial bispectrum, only on the
observationally established weak levels of primordial non-Gaussianity.",2005-03-16T22:17:53Z
"Power Spectrum Analysis of Far-IR Background Fluctuations in Spitzer
  Maps at 160 Microns","We describe data reduction and analysis of fluctuations in the Cosmic Far-IR
Background (CFIB) in large maps observed with the Multiband Imaging Photometer
for Spitzer (MIPS) instrument 160 micron detectors. We analyzed the
extragalactic First Look Survey (FLS) and the Spitzer Wide-area Infrared
Extragalactic Survey (SWIRE) Lockman Hole observations, the latter being the
largest low-cirrus mapping observation available. In the Lockman Hole map, we
measured the power spectrum of the CFIB by fitting a power law to the IR cirrus
component, the dominant foreground contaminant, and subtracting this cirrus
signal. The CFIB power spectrum at mid-high k (k ~ 0.2 - 0.5 arc min^-1) is
consistent with previous measurements of a relatively flat component. At lower
k, however, the power spectrum is clearly not flat, decreasing from our lowest
frequencies (k ~ 0.03 arc min^-1) and flattening at mid-frequencies (k ~ 0.1 -
0.2 arc min^-1). This behavior is consistent with the gross characteristics of
predictions of a source clustering signature in CFIB power spectra, and this is
the first report of such a detection.",2005-04-07T00:44:33Z
"Effects of Unstable Particles on Light-Element Abundances: Lithium
  versus Deuterium and He3","We reconsider the effects of unstable particles on the production and
destruction of the primordial light elements, with a view to reconciling the
high primordial Li7 abundance deduced from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), as
implied by the baryon-to-photon ratio now inferred from the anisotropies of the
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), with the lower abundance of Li7 observed in
halo stars. The potential destruction of Li7 is strongly constrained by
observations of Deuterium (D), He3 and Li6. We identify ranges for the unstable
particle abundance and lifetime which would deplete Li7 while remaining
consistent with the abundance of Li6. However, in these regions either the D
abundance is unacceptably low or the ratio He3/D is unacceptably large. We
conclude that late particle decay is unable to explain both the discrepancy of
the calculated Li7 abundance and the observed Li7 plateau. In the context of
supersymmetric theories with neutralino or gravitino dark matter, we display
the corresponding light-element constraints on the model parameters.",2005-03-01T18:25:17Z
Estimating Dark Matter Distributions,"Thanks to instrumental advances, new, very large kinematic datasets for
nearby dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies are on the horizon. A key aim of these
datasets is to help determine the distribution of dark matter in these
galaxies. Past analyses have generally relied on specific dynamical models or
highly restrictive dynamical assumptions. We describe a new, non-parametric
analysis of the kinematics of nearby dSph galaxies designed to take full
advantage of the future large datasets. The method takes as input the projected
positions and radial velocities of stars known to be members of the galaxies,
but does not use any parametric dynamical model, nor the assumption that the
mass distribution follows that of the visible matter. The problem of estimating
the radial mass distribution, M(r) (the mass interior to true radius r), is
converted into a problem of estimating a regression function
non-parametrically. From the Jeans Equation we show that the unknown regression
function is subject to fundamental shape restrictions which we exploit in our
analysis using statistical techniques borrowed from isotonic estimation and
spline smoothing. Simulations indicate that M(r) can be estimated to within a
factor of two or better with samples as small as 1000 stars over almost the
entire radial range sampled by the kinematic data. The technique is applied to
a sample of 181 stars in the Fornax dSph galaxy. We show that the galaxy
contains a significant, extended dark halo some ten times more massive than its
baryonic component. Though applied here to dSph kinematics, this approach can
be used in the analysis of any kinematically hot stellar system in which the
radial velocity field is discretely sampled.",2005-04-11T18:11:51Z
White Dwarf Heating and Subsequent Cooling in Dwarf Nova Outbursts,"We follow the time dependent thermal evolution of a white dwarf (WD)
undergoing sudden accretion in a dwarf nova outburst, using both simulations
and analytic estimates. The post-outburst lightcurve clearly separates into
early times when the WD flux is high, and late times when the flux is near the
quiescent level. The break between these two regimes, occurring at a time of
order the outburst duration, corresponds to a thermal diffusion wave reaching
the base of the freshly accreted layer. Our principal result is that long after
the outburst, the fractional flux perturbation about the quiescent flux decays
as a power law with time (and {\it not} as an exponential). We use this result
to construct a simple fitting formula that yields estimates for both the
quiescent flux and the accreted column, i.e. the total accreted mass divided by
WD surface area. The WD mass is not well constrained by the late time
lightcurve alone, but it can be inferred if the accreted mass is known from
observations. We compare our work with the well-studied outburst of WZ Sge,
finding that the cooling is well described by our model, giving an effective
temperature $T_{\rm eff}=14,500 {\rm K}$ and accreted column $\Delta
y\approx10^6 {\rm g cm^{-2}}$, in agreement with the modeling of Godon et al.
To reconcile this accreted column with the accreted mass inferred from the
bolometric accretion luminosity, a large WD mass $\gtrsim1.1M_\odot$ is needed.
Our power law result is a valuable tool for making quick estimates of the
outburst properties. We show that fitting the late time lightcurve with this
formula yields a predicted column within 20% of that estimated from our full
numerical calculations.",2005-03-30T00:16:08Z
"On the stratorotational instability in the quasi-hydrostatic
  semi-geostrophic limit","The linear normal-mode stratorotational instability (SRI) is analytically
reexamined in the inviscid limit where the length scales of horizontal
disturbances are large compared their vertical and radial counterparts.
Boundary conditions different than channel walls are also considered. This
quasi-hydrostatic, semi-geostrophic (QHSG) approximation allows one to examine
the effect of a vertically varying Brunt-Vaisaila frequency, $N^2$. It is found
that the normal-mode instability persists when $N^2$ increases quadratically
with respect to the disc vertical coordinate. However we also find that the SRI
seems to exist in this inviscid QHSG extreme only for channel wall conditions:
when one or both of the reflecting walls are removed there is no instability in
the asymptotic limit explored here. It is also found that only exponential-type
SRI modes (as defined by Dubrulle et al. 2005) exist under these conditions.
These equations also admit non-normal mode behaviour. Fixed Lagrangian pressure
conditions on both radial boundaries predicts there to be no normal mode
behaviour in the QHSG limit. The mathematical relationship between the results
obtained here and that of the classic Eady (1949) problem for baroclinic
instability is drawn. We conjecture as to the mathematical/physical nature of
the SRI.
  The general linear problem, analyzed without approximation in the context of
the Boussinesq equations, admits a potential vorticity-like quantity that is
advectively conserved by the shear. Its existence means that a continuous
spectrum \emph{is a generic feature of this system}. It also implies that in
places where the Brunt-Vaisaila frequency becomes dominant the linearized flow
may two-dimensionalize by advectively conserving its vertical vorticity.",2005-06-01T12:57:48Z
"Black hole physics and astrophysics: The GRB-Supernova connection and
  URCA-1 - URCA-2","We outline the confluence of three novel theoretical fields in our modeling
of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs): 1) the ultrarelativistic regime of a shock front
expanding with a Lorentz gamma factor $\sim 300$; 2) the quantum vacuum
polarization process leading to an electron-positron plasma originating the
shock front; and 3) the general relativistic process of energy extraction from
a black hole originating the vacuum polarization process. There are two
different classes of GRBs: the long GRBs and the short GRBs. We here address
the issue of the long GRBs. [...] We are specially interested, in this report,
to a subclass of long GRBs which appear to be accompanied by a supernova
explosion. We are considering two specific examples: GRB980425/SN1998bw and

Multiwavelength studies of WR 21a and its surroundings,"We present results of high-resolution radio continuum observations towards
the binary star WR 21a (Wack 2134) obtained with the Australia Telescope
Compact Array (ATCA) at 4.8 and 8.64 GHz. We detected the system at 4.8 GHz (6
cm) with a flux density of 0.25+-0.06 mJy and set an upper limit of 0.3 mJy at
8.64 GHz (3 cm). The derived spectral index of alpha < 0.3
[S(nu)=k.nu**(alpha)] suggests the presence of non-thermal emission, probably
originating in a colliding-wind region. A second, unrelated radio source was
detected ~10"" north of WR 21a at (RA, Dec)(J2000)=(10h 25m 56.49, -57deg 48'
34.4"", with flux densities of 0.36 and 0.55 mJy at 4.8 and 8.64 GHz,
respectively, resulting in alpha = 0.72. HI observations in the area are
dominated by absorption against the prominent HII region RCW 49. Analysis of a
complete set of archived X-ray observations of WR 21a confirms its strong
variability but throws into doubt previous suggestions by Reig (1999) of a
period of years for the system. Finally, we comment on the association with the
nearby EGRET source 3EG J1027-5817.",2005-06-16T00:31:18Z
"The Dark Halo of NGC 5963 as a Constraint on Dark Matter
  Self-Interaction at the Low Velocity Regime","Self-interacting dark matter has been proposed as a hypothesis to explain the
shallow central slopes of the density profiles of dark matter halos in
galaxies. In order to be consistent with observational studies at scales of
galaxy clusters, the cross section should scale inversely with the velocity of
collision. In this paper we consider the mass density profile of the halo of
the low surface brightness (LSB) galaxy NGC 5963 to place an upper limit on the
dark matter cross section for collisions with velocities $\sim 150$ km
s$^{-1}$, i.e. at the low velocity regime. After calibrating against
cosmological simulations, we found that the large inferred dark matter
concentration and central dark matter density in NGC 5963 are inconsistent with
an effective collisional cross section per unit of mass >0.2 cm^2/g.
Corrections were applied in order to account for reduction of the core by the
adiabatic contraction caused by cooling baryons. Our limits that involve a
number of simplifying, but always conservative, assumptions, exclude the last
permitted interval for velocity-dependent cross sections to explain the flat
density core in LSB galaxies. Implications for the nature of dark matter are
also discussed.",2005-06-15T14:54:10Z
"Stochastic Acceleration of $^3$He and $^4$He in Solar Flares by Parallel
  Propagating Plasma Waves: General Results","We study the acceleration in solar flares of $^3$He and $^4$He from a thermal
background by parallel propagating plasma waves with a general broken power-law
spectrum that takes into account the turbulence generation processes at large
scales and the thermal damping effects at small scales. The exact dispersion
relation for a cold plasma is used to describe the relevant wave modes. Because
low-energy $\alpha$-particles only interact with small scale waves in the
$^4$He-cyclotron branch, where the wave frequencies are below the
$\alpha$-particle gyro-frequency, their pitch angle averaged acceleration time
is at least one order of magnitude longer than that of $^3$He ions, which
mostly resonate with relatively higher frequency waves in the proton-cyclotron
(PC) branch. The $\alpha$-particle acceleration rate starts to approach that of
$^3$He beyond a few tens of keV nucleon$^{-1}$, where $\alpha$-particles can
also interact with long wavelength waves in the PC branch. However, the $^4$He
acceleration rate is always smaller than that of $^3$He. Consequently, the
acceleration of $^4$He is suppressed significantly at low energies, and the
spectrum of the accelerated $\alpha$-particles is always softer than that of
$^3$He. The model gives reasonable account of the observed low-energy $^3$He
and $^4$He fluxes and spectra in the impulsive solar energetic particle events
observed with the {\it Advanced Composition Explorer}. We explore the model
parameter space to show how observations may be used to constrain the model.",2005-02-17T03:58:49Z
"Chemical Abundances in the Secondary Star of the Neutron Star Binary
  Centaurus X-4","Using a high resolution spectrum of the secondary star in the neutron star
binary {Cen X-4}, we have derived the stellar parameters and veiling caused by
the accretion disk in a consistent way. We have used a $\chi^{2}$ minimization
procedure to explore a grid of 1 500 000 LTE synthetic spectra computed for a
plausible range of both stellar and veiling parameters. Adopting the best model
parameters found, we have determined atmospheric abundances of Fe, Ca, Ti, Ni
and Al. These element abundances are super solar ($\mathrm{[Fe/H]}=0.23 \pm
0.10$), but only the abundance of Ti and Ni appear to be moderately enhanced
($\ge1\sigma$) as compared with the average values of stars of similar iron
content. These element abundances can be explained if the secondary star
captured a significant amount of matter ejected from a spherically symmetric
supernova explosion of a 4 {$M_\odot$} He core progenitor and assuming solar
abundances as primordial abundances in the secondary star. The kinematic
properties of the system indicate that the neutron star received a natal kick
velocity through an aspherical SN and/or an asymmetric neutrino emission. The
former scenario might be ruled out since our model computations cannot produce
acceptable fits to the observed abundances. We have also examined whether this
system could have formed in the Galactic halo, and our simulations show that
this possibility seems unlikely. We also report a new determination of the Li
abundance consistent with previous studies that is unusually high and close to
the cosmic Li abundance in the Galactic disk.",2005-04-11T18:42:14Z
"KASCADE measurements of energy spectra for elemental groups of cosmic
  rays: Results and open problems","A composition analysis of KASCADE air shower data is performed by means of
unfolding the two-dimensional frequency spectrum of electron and muon numbers.
Aim of the analysis is the determination of energy spectra for elemental groups
representing the chemical composition of primary cosmic rays. Since such an
analysis depends crucially on simulations of air showers the two different
hadronic interaction models QGSJet and SIBYLL are used for their generation.
The resulting primary energy spectra show that the knee in the all particle
spectrum is due to a steepening of the spectra of light elements but, also,
that neither of the two simulation sets is able to describe the measured data
consistently over the whole energy range with discrepancies appearing in
different energy regions.",2005-05-19T16:28:45Z
Spectral Synthesis of SDSS Galaxies,"We investigate the power of spectral synthesis as a mean to estimate physical
properties of galaxies. Spectral synthesis is nothing more than the
decomposition of an observed spectrum in terms of a superposition of a base of
simple stellar populations of various ages and metallicities (here from Bruzual
& Charlot 2003), producing as output the star-formation and chemical histories
of a galaxy, its extinction and velocity dispersion. We discuss the reliability
of this approach and apply it to a volume limited sample of 50362 galaxies from
the SDSS Data Release 2, producing a catalog of stellar population properties.
A comparison with recent estimates of both observed and physical properties of
these galaxies obtained by other groups shows good qualitative and quantitative
agreement, despite substantial differences in the method of analysis. The
confidence in the method is further strengthened by several empirical and
astrophysically reasonable correlations between synthesis results and
independent quantities. For instance, we report the existence of strong
correlations between stellar and nebular metallicites, stellar and nebular
extinctions, mean stellar age and equivalent width of Halpha and 4000 \AA
break, and between stellar mass and velocity dispersion. We also present
preliminary results of an analysis of a magnitude-limited sample which clearly
reveals that the bimodality of galaxy populations is present in the parameters
computed in the synthesis. Our results are also consistent with the
""down-sizing"" scenario of galaxy formation and evolution. Finally, we point out
one of the major problems facing spectral synthesis of early-type systems: the
spectral base adopted here is based on solar-scaled evolutionary tracks whose
abundance pattern may not be appropriate for this type of galaxy.",2005-06-17T16:59:06Z
The sub-DLA toward HE0001-2340: galaxy formation at z=2,"We present a detailed analysis of chemical abundances in a sub-damped Ly
alpha absorber (sub-DLA) at z=2.187 towards the quasar HE0001-2340 (z_em=2.28)
using VLT/UVES data. This sub-DLA system consists of at least 25 individual
subcomponents spanning a restframe velocity range of ~400 km/s. Detected
species include CII, CIV, NI, NII, OI, MgII, AlII, AlIII, SiII, SiIV, PII,
FeII, and possibly DI. For the dominating neutral gas component at v=+13 km/s
we derive an oxygen abundance of [O/H]=-1.81. With its extremely low nitrogen
content ([N/H]<-3.3 and [N/O]<-1.5) the absorber exhibits a classic massive
star abundance pattern. The low [N/O] value is consistent with the idea that
primary nitrogen production by the very first stars have enriched the
intergalactic gas to a level of [N/O] ~ -1.5. Peculiar abundances are found in
the outermost blue components, where we observe significant overabundances of
phosphorus ([P/C] ~ +1.5), silicon ([Si/C] ~ +0.6), and aluminum ([Al/C] ~
+0.5). Our study suggests that the sight line passes through the gaseous
environment of one or more stellar clusters that locally enriched their
interstellar neighbourhood by supernova ejecta generating the observed
abundance anomalies. The large velocity spread of the entire absorption system
points to a merger that triggers the formation of these clusters. We thus may
be observing a young galaxy at z ~ 2 that currently forms out of a merger event
(abstract truncated).",2005-05-17T08:35:49Z
Tiny HI Clouds in the Local ISM,"We report deep, high spectral resolution WSRT HI 21cm observations of four

tiny, discrete clouds in the diffuse ISM, with peak optical depths tau ~
0.1-2%, HI column densities of 0.4-8 * 10^{18} cm^{-2} and core temperatures of
20-80 K. Imaging detections confirm these low column densities and imply linear
core dimensions of a few thousand AU, assuming a distance of 100 pc. The
physical origin of these tiny HI structures and their distribution in the ISM

whether they are a ubiquitous component of the ISM.",2005-05-03T13:25:58Z
GRB 050509B: Constraints on short gamma-ray burst models,"We have obtained deep optical images with the Very Large Telescope at ESO of
the first well-localized short-duration gamma-ray burst, GRB 050509B. From V
and R imaging, initiated ~2 days after the GRB trigger and lasting up to three
weeks, we detect no variable object inside the small Swift/XRT X-ray error
circle down to 2sigma limits of V = 26.5 and R = 25.1. The X-ray error circle
includes a giant elliptical galaxy at z = 0.225, which has been proposed as the
likely host of this GRB. Our limits indicate that if the GRB originated at z =
0.225, any supernova-like event accompanying the GRB would have to be over 100
times fainter than normal Type Ia SNe or Type Ic hypernovae, 5 times fainter
than the faintest known Ia or Ic SNe, and fainter than the faintest known Type
II SNe. Moreover, we use the optical limits to constrain the energetics of the
GRB outflow. Simple models indicate that, unless the intrinsic energy in the
outflow from GRB 050509B was << 10^51 erg, there was very little radioactive
material with efficient decay timescales for generating a large luminosity.
These limits strongly constrain progenitor models for this short GRB.",2005-06-06T19:30:37Z
"Measuring the Halo Mass of z=3 Damped Ly-alpha Absorbers from the
  Absorber-Galaxy Cross-correlation","[Abridged] We test the reliability of a method to measure the mean halo mass
of Damped Ly-alpha absorbers (DLAs). The method is based on measuring the ratio
of the cross-correlation between DLAs and galaxies to the auto-correlation of
the galaxies themselves ($w_{\rm dg}/w_{\rm gg}$), which is (in linear theory)
the ratio of their bias factor. This is shown to be true irrespective of the
galaxy redshift distribution, provided that one uses the same galaxies for the
two correlation functions. The method is applicable to all redshifts. Here, we
focus on z=3 DLAs and we demonstrate that the method robustly constrains the
mean DLA halo mass using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) cosmological
simulations. If we use the bias formalism of Mo & White with the DLA and galaxy
mass distributions of these simulations, we predict a bias ratio of 0.771.
Direct measurement from the simulations of $w_{\rm dg}/w_{\rm gg}$ st yields a
ratio of 0.73+/-0.08, in excellent agreement with that prediction.
Equivalently, inverting the measured correlation ratio to infer a mean DLA halo
mass yields (log. averaging, in solar units) <log(M_DLA)> =11.13+/-013, in
excellent agreement with the true value in the simulations: 11.16. The cross-
correlation method thus appears to yield a robust estimate of the average host
halo mass even though the DLAs and the galaxies occupy a broad mass spectrum of
halos, and massive halos contain multiple galaxies with DLAs. We show that the
inferred mean DLA halo mass is independent of the galaxy sub-sample used, i.e.
the cross-correlation technique is also reliable. Our results imply that the
cross-correlation length between DLAs and LBGs is predicted to be, at most,
2.85 Mpc. Future observations will soon distinguish models in which DLAs are in
low mass halos from those in which DLAs are in massive halos.",2005-04-07T08:52:57Z
"Restframe I-band Hubble diagram for type Ia supernovae up to redshift z
  ~0.5","We present a novel technique for fitting restframe I-band light curves on a
data set of 42 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Using the result of the fit, we
construct a Hubble diagram with 26 SNe from the subset at 0.01< z<0.1. Adding
two SNe at z~0.5 yields results consistent with a flat
Lambda-dominated``concordance universe''
($\Omega_M,\Omega_\Lambda$)=(0.25,0.75). For one of these, SN 2000fr, new near
infrared data are presented. The high redshift supernova NIR data are also used
to test for systematic effects in the use of SNe Ia as distance estimators. A
flat, Lambda=0, universe where the faintness of supernovae at z~0.5 is due to
grey dust homogeneously distributed in the intergalactic medium is disfavoured
based on the high-z Hubble diagram using this small data-set. However, the
uncertainties are large and no firm conclusion may be drawn. We explore the
possibility of setting limits on intergalactic dust based on B-I and B-V colour
measurements, and conclude that about 20 well measured SNe are needed to give
statistically significant results. We also show that the high redshift
restframe I-band data points are better fit by light curve templates that show
a prominent second peak, suggesting that they are not intrinsically
underluminous.",2005-04-06T10:16:13Z
"A feasibility study of future observations with MIDI and other VLTI
  science instruments: The example of the Galactic Center","VLT-Interferometry will allow imaging of the Galactic Center (GC) and the
nuclei of extragalactic sources at an angular resolution of a few
milliarcseconds. VLTI will be a prime instrument to study the immediate
environment of the massive black hole at the center of the Milky Way. With the
MID infrared Interferometric instrument (MIDI) for example the enigmatic
compact dust embedded MIR-excess sources within the central parsec should be
resolvable. Further the observations of external galactic nuclei will allow
unprecedented measurements of physical parameters (i.e. structure and
luminosity) in these systems. With the exception of a few 'self-referencing'
sources these faint-target observations will benefit from the available
off-axis wavefront-correction system. To fully exploit the use of VLTI within
this context, the following questions have to be addressed among others: How
feasible is blind-pointing on (faint) science targets? Are VLTI observations
still efficiently feasible if these faint science targets exceed the usual
angular distance (<=1arcmin) to a GuideStar [...]? How is the fringe-tracking
procedure affected in densely populated regions such as the GC? What
preparatory steps have to be performed to successfully observe these
non-standard targets with the VLTI? In this contribution, we present aspects
for the preparation of VLTI observations, which will be conducted in the near
future. Considering these example observations of the GC region, several
details of observing modes are discussed, which are necessary to observe such
science targets. The final goal is the definition of observational strategies
[...] touching the limits of VLTI observability.",2005-05-11T12:50:16Z

viewpoint of our ability to differentiate between cosmological models with
different primordial B-mode content. We focus on the low Galactic emission sky
patch, corresponding to the target of several operating and planned CMB
experiments and which, in many respects, adequately represents a typical
""clean"" high latitude sky. We consider two fiducial observations, one operating
at low (40, 90 GHz) and one at high (150, 350 GHz) frequencies and thus
dominated by the synchrotron and thermal dust emission, respectively. We use a
parallel version of the FASTICA code to explore a substantial parameter space
including Gaussian pixel noise level, observed sky area and the amplitude of
the foreground emission and employ large Monte Carlo simulations to quantify
errors and biases pertinent to the reconstruction for different choices of the
parameter values. We identify a large subspace of the parameter space for which
the quality of the CMB reconstruction is excellent. For both the cosmological
models, with and without the primordial gravitational waves, we find that
FASTICA performs extremely well even in the cases when the B mode CMB signal is
up to a few times weaker than the foreground contamination and the noise
amplitude is comparable with the total CMB polarized emission. In addition we
discuss limiting cases of the noise and foreground amplitudes, for which the
ICA approach fails.",2005-05-18T14:53:05Z
"On the Observational Status of Ultrahigh Energy Cosmic Rays and their
  Possible Origin in Starburst-Like Galaxies","This paper presents a brief review of the current status of ultrahigh energy
cosmic ray observations and discusses nearby starburst-like galaxies as their
possible origin.",2005-05-13T15:04:48Z
"Entropy amplification from energy feedback in simulated galaxy groups
  and clusters","We use hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters and groups to study the
effect of pre-heating on the entropy structure of the ICM. Our simulations
account for non-gravitational heating of the gas either by imposing a minimum
entropy floor at redshift z=3, or by considering feedback by galactic winds
powered by supernova (SN) energy. In the adiabatic simulations we find that the
entropy is increased out to the external regions as a consequence of the
transition from clumpy to smooth accretion induced by extra heating. This
result is in line with the predictions of the semi-analytical model by Voit et
al. However, the introduction of radiative cooling substantially reduces this
entropy amplification effect. While galactic winds of increasing strength are
effective in regulating star formation, they have a negligible effect on the
entropy profile of cluster-sized halos. Only in models where the action of the
winds is complemented with diffuse heating corresponding to a pre-collapse
entropy do we find a sizable entropy amplification out to the virial radius of
the groups. Observational evidence for entropy amplification in the outskirts
of galaxy clusters and groups therefore favours a scenario for feedback that
distributes heating energy in a more diffuse way than predicted by the model
for galactic winds from SN explosions explored here.",2005-04-12T08:59:31Z
Can Life develop in the expanded habitable zones around Red Giant Stars?,"We present some new ideas about the possibility of life developing around
sub-giant and red giant stars. Our study concerns the temporal evolution of the
habitable zone. The distance between the star and the habitable zone, as well
as its width, increases with time as a consequence of stellar evolution. The
habitable zone moves outward after the star leaves the main sequence, sweeping
a wider range of distances from the star until the star reaches the tip of the
asymptotic giant branch. If life could form and evolve over time intervals from
$5 \times 10^8$ to $10^9$ years, then there could be habitable planets with
life around red giant stars. For a 1 M$_{\odot}$ star at the first stages of
its post main-sequence evolution, the temporal transit of the habitable zone is
estimated to be of several 10$^9$ years at 2 AU and around 10$^8$ years at 9
AU. Under these circumstances life could develop at distances in the range 2-9
AU in the environment of sub-giant or giant stars and in the far distant future
in the environment of our own Solar System. After a star completes its first
ascent along the Red Giant Branch and the He flash takes place, there is an
additional stable period of quiescent He core burning during which there is
another opportunity for life to develop. For a 1 M$_{\odot}$ star there is an
additional $10^9$ years with a stable habitable zone in the region from 7 to 22
AU. Space astronomy missions, such as proposed for the Terrestrial Planet
Finder (TPF) and Darwin should also consider the environments of sub-giants and
red giant stars as potentially interesting sites for understanding the
development of life.",2005-03-23T22:46:20Z
Radio Quiet AGN,"Active Galactic Nuclei are powered by accretion onto massive black holes.
Although radio-quiet objects are not as spectacular sources of very high energy
photons as radio-loud ones this class of objects also represents a challenge
for modeling high energy processes close to a black hole. Both a hot optically
thin plasma and a cooler optically thick accretion disk are usually thought to
be present in the vicinity of a black hole although the details of the
accretion flow are still under discussion. The role of the disk seems to
decrease with a drop in the Eddington ratio: in sources like quasars and Narrow
Line Seyfert 1 galaxies disk flow dominates while in Seyfert galaxies the disk
retreats, and in sources like LINERS or Sgr A* a disk is most likely absent.
Shocks and reconnections are possibly taking place in an inner hot flow and in
the magnetic corona above the cold disk. Uncollimated outflow is also present
and it may carry significant fraction of available mass and energy.",2005-06-03T15:59:52Z
"The Calibration of the Swift/UVOT Optical Observations: A Recipe for
  Photometry","Swift/UVOT has the capability to provide critical insight into the physics of
the early afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). But without precise
calibration of the UVOT to standard photometric systems, it is impossible to
leverage late- time, ground-based follow-up data to the early-time UVOT
observations. In this paper, we present a calibration of the Swift/UVOT
photometry to the standard Johnson UBV system for the UVOT UBV filters,and a
step-by-step photometry recipe for analyzing these data. We base our analysis
on aperture photometry performed on the ground-based and UVOT observations of
the local standard stars in the fields of supernovae (SNe) 2005am and 2005cf,
and a number of Landolt standard stars.We find that the optimal photometry
aperture radius for UVOT data is small (2"".5 for unbinned data,3"".0 for 2X2
binned data),and show that the coincidence- loss (C-loss) correction is
important even for relatively faint magnitudes (mag 16 to 19). Based on a
theoretically motivated model,we fit the C-loss correction with two parameters,
the photometric zero point (ZP) and the saturation magnitude (m_inf), and
derive tight constraints for both parameters [sigma(ZP) = 0.01 mag and
sigma(m_inf) = 0.02 mag)].We find that the color term correction is not
necessary for the UVOT B and V filters,but is necessary for the U filter for
blue objects [(U - V) < 0.4 mag]. We also apply our calibration results to the
UVOT observations of GRB 050603. There is a scatter of ~0.04--0.08 mag in our
final UVOT photometry, the cause of which is unclear, but may be partly due to
the spatial variation in the pixel sensitivity of the UVOT detector.",2005-05-25T08:39:54Z
The Shape of the Inner Rim in Proto-Planetary Disks,"This paper discusses the properties of the inner puffed-up rim which forms in
circumstellar disks when dust evaporates. We argue that the rim shape is
controlled by a fundamental property of circumstellar disks, namely their very
large vertical density gradient, through the dependence of grain evaporation
temperature on gas density. As a result, the bright side of the rim is
""curved"", rather than ""vertical"", as expected when a constant evaporation
temperature is assumed. We have computed a number of rim models, which take
into account this effect in a self-consistent way. The results show that the
curved rim (as the vertical rim) emits most of its radiation in the near and
mid-IR, and provides a simple explanation to the observed values of the near-IR
excess (the ""3 micron bump"" of Herbig Ae stars). Contrary to the vertical rim,
for curved rims the near-IR excess does not depend much on the inclination,
being maximum for face-on objects. We have then computed synthetic images of
the curved rim seen under different inclinations; face-on rims are seen as
bright, centrally symmetric rings on the sky; increasing the inclination, the
rim takes an elliptical shape, with one side brighter than the other.",2005-03-29T22:22:32Z
Abell 370: A Cluster with a Pronounced Triaxial Morphology,"We here combine Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, X-ray observations and
spectroscopic redshifts of member galaxies, to constrain the intrinsic
three-dimensional shape of the galaxy cluster: Abell 370. The cluster turns out
to be strongly elongated along the l.o.s., with two (or more) substructures in
the process of merging. Spectroscopy further suggests that the process must be
taking place at a small angle respect to the l.o.s.",2005-02-14T05:10:26Z
Second Data Release of the 6dF Galaxy Survey,"The 6dF Galaxy Survey is measuring around 150000 redshifts and 15000 peculiar
velocities from galaxies over the southern sky at |b|>10 degrees. When
complete, it will be the largest survey of its kind by more than an order of
magnitude. Here we describe the characteristics of the Second Incremental Data
Release (DR2) and provide an update of the survey. This follows earlier data
made public in December 2002 and March 2004. A total of 83014 sources now have
their spectra, redshifts, near-infrared and optical photometry available online

"Submillimetre photometry of X-ray absorbed QSOs: their formation and
  evolutionary status","We present an analysis of the submillimetre/X-ray properties of 19 X-ray
absorbed, Compton-thin quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) selected to have
luminosities and redshifts which represent the peak of cosmic QSO activity.
i.e. ~L* objects at 1<z<3. Of these, we present new data for 11 objects not
previously observed at submillimetre wavelengths and additional data for a
further 3. The detection rate is 42 per cent, much higher than typically
reported for samples of QSOs. Detection statistics show (at the 3-4 sigma
level) that this sample of absorbed QSOs has a higher submillimetre output than
a matched sample of unabsorbed QSOs. We argue that the far-infrared luminosity
is produced by massive star formation. In this case, the correlation found
between far-infrared luminosity and redshift can be interpreted as cosmological
evolution of the star-formation rate in the QSO host galaxies. Since the
submillimetre luminous phase is confined to z>1.5, the high star formation
rates are consistent with a scenario in which the QSOs evolve to become local
luminous elliptical galaxies.
  Combining these results with previously published data for X-ray unabsorbed
QSOs and submillimetre-selected galaxies we propose the following evolutionary
sequence: the forming galaxy is initially far-infrared luminous but X-ray weak
similar to the sources discovered by the Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer
Array; as the black hole and spheroid grow with time a point is reached when
the central QSO becomes powerful enough to terminate the star formation and
eject the bulk of the fuel supply (the Compton-thin absorbed QSO phase); this
transition is followed by a period of unobscured QSO activity which
subsequently declines to leave a quiescent spheroidal galaxy.",2005-03-29T12:22:22Z
"Chandra X-ray Observations of the Young Stellar Cluster NGC 6193 in the
  Ara OB1 Association","A 90 ks Chandra HETG observation of the young stellar cluster NGC 6193 in the
southern Ara OB1 association detected 43 X-ray sources in a 2' x 2' core region
centered on the young O stars HD 150135 (O6.5V) and HD 150136 (O3+O6V). The
cluster is dominated by exceptionally bright X-ray emission from the two O
stars, which are separated by only 10 arcsecs. The X-ray luminosity of HD
150136 is log Lx = 33.39 (ergs/s), making it one of the most luminous O-star
X-ray sources known. All of the fainter X-ray sources in the core region have
near-IR counterparts, but JHK photometry provides little evidence for near-IR
excesses. These core sources have typical mean photon energies of 2 keV and
about one-third are variable. It is likely that some are young low-mass stars
in the cluster, but cluster membership remains to be determined. Grating
spectra show that the X-ray properties of HD 150135 and HD 150136 are similar,
but not identical. Both have moderately broadened unshifted emission lines and
their emission is dominated by cool plasma, pointing to a wind shock origin.
However, the emission of HD 150136 is slightly hotter and 4 times more luminous
than its optical twin HD 150135. We discuss the possibility that a radiative
colliding wind shock contributes to the prodigious X-ray output of the
short-period (2.66 d) binary HD 150136. A surprising result is that the X-ray
emission of HD 150136 is slowly variable on a timescale of less than one day.
The origin of the variability is not yet known, but the observed behavior
suggests that it is an occultation effect.",2005-04-25T22:26:48Z
SN 1998A: Explosion of a Blue Supergiant,"We present spectroscopic and photometric observations of the peculiar Type II
supernova (SN) 1998A. The light curves and spectra closely resemble those of SN
1987A, suggesting that the SN 1998A progenitor exploded when it was a compact
blue supergiant. However, the comparison with SN 1987A also highlights some
important differences: SN 1998A is more luminous and the spectra show bluer
continua and larger expansion velocities at all epochs. These observational
properties indicate that the explosion of SN 1998A is more energetic than SN
1987A and more typical of SNe II. Comparing the observational data to
simulations, we deduce that the progenitor of SN 1998A was a massive star (~ 25
Mo) with a small pre-supernova radius (< 6 x 10^{12} cm). The Ba II lines,
unusually strong in SN 1987A and some faint II--P events, are almost normal in
the case of SN 1998A, indicating that the temperature plays a key role in
determining their strength.",2005-04-05T16:21:11Z
"Two-temperature accretion flows in magnetic cataclysmic variables:
  Structures of post-shock emission regions and X-ray spectroscopy","We use a two-temperature hydrodynamical formulation to determine the
temperature and density structures of the post-shock accretion flows in
magnetic cataclysmic variables (mCVs) and calculate the corresponding X-ray
spectra. The effects of two-temperature flows are significant for systems with
a massive white dwarf and a strong white-dwarf magnetic field. Our calculations
show that two-temperature flows predict harder keV spectra than one-temperature
flows for the same white-dwarf mass and magnetic field. This result is
insensitive to whether the electrons and ions have equal temperature at the
shock but depends on the electron-ion exchange rate, relative to the rate of
radiative loss along the flow. White-dwarf masses obtained by fitting the X-ray
spectra of mCVs using hydrodynamic models including the two-temperature effects
will be lower than those obtained using single-temperature models. The bias is
more severe for systems with a massive white dwarf.",2005-04-12T11:08:55Z
"Multi-object spectroscopy of low redshift EIS clusters. III. Properties
  of optically selected clusters","We have carried out an investigation of the properties of low redshift EIS
clusters using both spectroscopy and imaging data. We present new redshifts for
738 galaxies in 21 ESO Imaging Survey (EIS) Cluster fields. We use the
``gap''-technique to search for significant overdensities in redshift space and
to identify groups/clusters of galaxies corresponding to the original EIS
matched filter cluster candidates. In this way we spectroscopically confirm 20
of the 21 cluster candidates with a matched-filter estimated redshift z_MF=0.2.
We have now obtained spectroscopic redshifts for 34 EIS cluster candidates with
z_MF=0.2 (see also Hansen et al., 2002; Olsen et al., 2003). Of those we
spectroscopically confirm 32 with redshifts ranging from z=0.064 to 0.283. We
find that: 1) the velocity dispersions of the systems range from
sigma_v<=130km/s to sigma_v=1200km/s, typical of galaxy groups to rich
clusters; 2) richnesses corresponding to Abell classes R<=1; and 3)
concentration indices ranging from C=0.2 to C=1.2. From the analysis of the
colours of the galaxy populations we find that 53% of the spectroscopically
confirmed systems have a ``significant'' red sequence. These systems are on
average richer and have higher velocity dispersions. We find that the colour of
the red sequence galaxies matches passive stellar evolution predictions.",2005-02-25T15:00:31Z
Generating cosmological perturbations with mass variations,"We study the possibility that large scale cosmological perturbations have
been generated during the domination and decay of a massive particle species
whose mass depends on the expectation value of a light scalar field. We discuss
the constraints that must be imposed on the field in order to remain light and
on the annihilation cross section and decay rate of the massive particles in
order for the mechanism to be efficient. We compute the resulting curvature
perturbations after the mass domination, recovering the results of Dvali,
Gruzinov, and Zaldarriaga in the limit of total domination. By comparing the
amplitude of perturbations generated by the mass domination to those originally
present from inflation, we conclude that this mechanism can be the primary
source of perturbations only if inflation does not rely on slow-roll
conditions.",2005-03-08T08:48:48Z
The Masses of the Orion Proplyds from Submillimeter Dust Emission,"We have imaged the 880 micron continuum emission from the ""proplyds"" in the
center of the Trapezium Cluster in Orion using the Submillimeter Array with a
beam size 1.5'' FWHM and an rms of 2.7 mJy. Five sources are detected with
fluxes in the range 18 to 38 mJy, which includes dust emission from four
proplyds and ionized gas from theta1 Ori G. The total masses of the detected
proplyds derived from their dust emission range from 0.013 to 0.024 Msun
assuming a dust temperature of 20 K and mass opacity of 0.03 cm^2/g. The
eighteen other proplyds within the field-of-view were not formally detected
individually, but by combining the fluxes measured at their locations, an
average flux of 1.1mJy was determined for them on a statistical basis,
corresponding to a mass of 8e-4 Msun. The four detected proplyds have
sufficient disk mass bound to their central stars to form planetary systems on
the scale of our Solar System.",2005-06-10T03:45:17Z
Dynamical bar instability in a relativistic rotational core collapse,"We investigate the rotational core collapse of a rapidly rotating
relativistic star by means of a 3+1 hydrodynamical simulations in conformally
flat spacetime of general relativity. We concentrate our investigation to the
bounce of the rotational core collapse, since potentially most of the
gravitational waves from it are radiated around the core bounce. The dynamics
of the star is started from a differentially rotating equilibrium star of T/W ~
0.16 (T is the rotational kinetic energy and W is the gravitational binding
energy of the equilibrium star), depleting the pressure to initiate the
collapse and to exceed the threshold of dynamical bar instability. Our finding
is that the collapsing star potentially forms a bar when the star has a
toroidal structure due to the redistribution of the angular momentum at the
core bounce. On the other hand, the collapsing star weakly forms a bar when the
star has a spheroidal structure. We also find that the bar structure of the
star is destroyed when the torus is destroyed in the rotational core collapse.
Since the collapse of a toroidal star potentially forms a bar, it can be a
promising source of gravitational waves which will be detected in advanced
LIGO.",2005-05-19T21:01:58Z

"The Linearity of the Wesenheit function for the Large Magellanic Cloud
  Cepheids","There is strong evidence that the period-luminosity (PL) relation for the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) Cepheids shows a break at a period around 10 days.
Since the LMC PL relation is extensively used in distance scale studies, the
non-linearity of the LMC PL relation may affect the results based on this LMC
calibrated relation. In this paper we show that this problem can be remedied by
using the Wesenheit function in obtaining Cepheid distances. This is because
the Wesenheit function is linear although recent data suggests that the PL and
the period-colour (PC) relations that make up the Wesenheit function are not.
We test the linearity of the Wesenheit function and find strong evidence that
the LMC Wesenheit function is indeed linear. This is because the non-linearity
of the PL and PC relations cancel out when the Wesenheit function is
constructed. We discuss this result in the context of distance scale
applications. We also compare the distance moduli obtained from
mu_0=mu_V-R(mu_V-mu_I) (equivalent to Wesenheit functions) constructed with the
linear and the broken LMC PL relations, and find that the typical difference in
distance moduli is ~ +-0.03mag. Hence, the broken LMC PL relation does not
seriously affect current distance scale applications. We also discuss the
random error calculated with equation mu_0=mu_V-R(mu_V-mu_I), and show that
there is a correlation term that exists from the calculation of the random
error. The calculated random error will be larger if this correlation term is
ignored.",2005-04-08T15:28:32Z
Cosmology with a Variable Chaplygin Gas,"We consider a new generalized Chaplygin gas model that includes the original
Chaplygin gas model as a special case. In such a model the generalized
Chaplygin gas evolves as from dust to quiessence or phantom. We show that the
background evolution for the model is equivalent to that for a coupled dark
energy model with dark matter. The constraints from the current type Ia
supernova data favour a phantom-like Chaplygin gas model.",2005-06-04T04:35:16Z
"The loopy UV line profiles of RU Lupi: accretion, outflows, and
  fluorescence","We present far-ultraviolet spectra of the classical T Tauri star RU Lupi
covering the 912-1710 A spectral range, as observed by the HST/STIS and FUSE
satellites. We use these spectra, which are rich in emission and absorption
lines, to probe both the accreting and outflowing gas. Absorption in the
Ly-alpha profile constrains the extinction to A_V=0.07 mag, which we confirm
with other diagnostics. We estimate a mass accretion rate of
(5\pm2)\times10^{-8}$ M_\odot/yr using the optical-NUV accretion continuum. The
accreting gas is also detected in bright, broad lines of C IV, Si IV, and N V,
which all show complex structures across the line profile. Many other emission
lines, including those of H_2 and Fe II, are pumped by Ly-alpha. RU Lupi's
spectrum varies significantly in the FUV; our STIS observations occurred when
RU Lupi was brighter than several other observations in the FUV, possibly due
to a high mass accretion rate.",2005-04-29T04:34:41Z
"A full sky prediction of the SZ effect from diffuse hot gas in the local
  universe and the upper limit from the WMAP data","We use the PSCz galaxy redshift catalogue combined with constrained
simulations based on the IRAS 1.2 Jy galaxy density field to estimate the
contribution of hot gas in the local universe to the SZ-effect on large scales.
We produce a full sky Healpix map predicting the SZ-effect from clusters as
well as diffuse hot gas within 80Mpc/h. Performing cross-correlation tests
between this map and the WMAP data in pixel, harmonic and wavelet space we can
put an upper limit on the effect. We conclude that the SZ effect from diffuse
gas in the local universe cannot be detected in current CMB data and is not a
contaminating factor on large scales (l<60) in studies of the CMB angular
anisotropies. However, for future high sensitivity experiments observing at a
wider range of frequencies, the predicted large scale SZ effect could be of
importance.",2005-02-10T21:11:57Z
"Metal Abundances in a Damped Lyman-alpha System Along Two Lines of Sight
  at z=0.93","We study metal abundances in the z=0.9313 damped Lya system observed in the
two lines-of-sight, A and B, toward the gravitationally-lensed double QSO
HE0512-3329. Spatially resolved STIS spectra constrain the neutral-gas column
density to be LogN(HI)=20.5 in both Aand B. UVES spectra (spectral resolution
FWHM=9.8 km/s) show, in contrast, significant line-of-sight differences in the
column densities of MnII and FeII; these are not due to observational
systematics. We find that [Mn/H]=-1.44 and [Fe/H]=-1.52 in damped Lya system A,
while [Mn/H]=-0.98 and [Fe/H]>-1.32, and possibly as high as [Fe/H] approx. -1
in damped Lya system B. A careful assessment of possible systematic errors
leads us to conclude that these transverse differences are significant at a 5
sigma level or greater. Although nucleosynthesis effects may also be at play,
we favor differential dust-depletion as the main mechanism producing the
observed abundance gradient. The transverse separation is 5 kpc at the redshift
of the absorber, which is also likely to be the lensing galaxy. The derived
abundances therefore probe two opposite sides of a single galaxy hosting both
damped Lya systems. This is the first time firm abundance constraints have been
obtained for a single damped system probed by two lines-of-sight. The
significance of this finding for the cosmic evolution of metals is discussed.",2005-03-01T19:58:54Z
The Phase-Space Parameters of Brightest Halo Galaxies,"The brightest galaxy in a dark matter halo is expected to reside at rest at
the center of the halo. In this paper we test this `Central Galaxy Paradigm'
using group catalogues extracted from the 2dFGRS and the SDSS. For each group
we compute a parameter, R, defined as the difference between the velocity of
the brightest group galaxy and the average velocity of the other group members
(hereafter satellites), normalized by the unbiased estimator of the velocity
dispersion of the satellite galaxies. Using detailed mock galaxy redshift
surveys, we show that the central galaxy paradigm is inconsistent with the data
at high confidence, and that instead the brightest halo galaxies have a
specific kinetic energy that is about 25 percent of that of the satellites.
This indicates that either central galaxies reside at the minimum of the dark
matter potential, but that the halo itself is not yet fully relaxed, or, that
the halo is relaxed, but that the central galaxy oscillates in its potential
well. The former is consistent with the fact that we find a weak hint that the
velocity bias of brightest halo galaxies is larger in more massive haloes,
while the latter may be indicative of cored, rather than cusped, dark matter
haloes. We discuss several implications of these findings, including mass
estimates based on satellite kinematics, strong gravitational lensing, halo
occupation models, and the frequency and longevity of lopsidedness in disk
galaxies.",2005-02-23T15:40:40Z
"The dynamical fingerprint of intermediate mass black holes in globular
  clusters","A number of observations hints for the presence of an intermediate mass black
hole (IMBH) in the core of three globular clusters: M15 and NGC 6752 in the
Milky Way, and G1, in M31. However the existence of these IMBHs is far form
being conclusive. In this paper, we review their main formation channels and
explore possible observational signs that a single or binary IMBH can imprint
on cluster stars. In particular we explore the role played by a binary IMBH in
transferring angular momentum and energy to stars flying by.",2005-04-08T10:32:07Z
A Jovian-mass Planet in Microlensing Event OGLE-2005-BLG-071,"We report the discovery of a several-Jupiter mass planetary companion to the
primary lens star in microlensing event OGLE-2005-BLG-071. Precise (<1%)
photometry at the peak of the event yields an extremely high signal-to-noise
ratio detection of a deviation from the light curve expected from an isolated
lens. The planetary character of this deviation is easily and unambiguously
discernible from the gross features of the light curve. Detailed modeling
yields a tightly-constrained planet-star mass ratio of q=m_p/M=0.0071+/-0.0003.
This is the second robust detection of a planet with microlensing,
demonstrating that the technique itself is viable and that planets are not rare
in the systems probed by microlensing, which typically lie several kpc toward
the Galactic center.",2005-05-20T20:00:15Z
"Model-Independent Multi-Variable Gamma-Ray Burst Luminosity Indicator
  and Its Possible Cosmological Implications","We present a multi-variable regression analysis to several observable
quantities for a sample of 15 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The observables used in
the analysis includes the isotropic gamma-ray energy (E_{gamma,iso}), the peak
energy of the nu F_nu spectrum in the rest frame (E_p'), and the rest frame
break time of the optical afterglow light curves(t_b'). A strong dependence of
E_{gamma, iso on E_p' and t_b' is derived. We also extend the analysis to the
isotropic afterglow energies in the X-ray and the optical bands, respectively,
and find that they are essentially not correlated with E_p' and t_b'. Regarding
the E_{gamma, iso(E_p', t_b') relationship as a luminosity indicator, we
explore the possible constraints on the cosmological parameters using the GRB
sample. Our results indicate 0.13<omega_M<0.49 and 0.50<Omega_Lambda<0.85 for a
flat Universe. The decelerating factor and its cosmological evolution, and the
transition redshift are also investigated. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we
find that the GRB sample satisfying our relationship observationally tends to
be a soft and bright one, and that the contraints on the cosmological
parameters can be much improved either by the enlargement of the sample size or
by the increase of the observational precision. Furthermore, the detections of
a few high redshift GRBs satisfying the correlation could greatly tighten the
constraints (abridged).",2005-04-19T01:23:38Z
"A compact binary merger model for the short, hard GRB 050509b","The first X-ray afterglow for a short (~30 ms), hard gamma-ray burst was
detected by Swift on 9 May 2005 (GRB 050509b). No optical or radio counterpart
was identified in follow-up observations. The tentative association of the GRB
with a nearby giant elliptical galaxy at redshift z=0.2248 would imply a total
energy release E(gamma, isotropic) ~3 x 10**48 erg, and that the progenitor had
traveled several tens of kpc from its point of origin, in agreement with
expectations linking these events to the final merger of compact binaries
driven by gravitational wave emission. We model the dynamical merger of such a
system and the time-dependent evolution of the accretion tori thus created. The
resulting energetics, variability, and expected durations are consistent with
GRB 050509b originating from the tidal disruption of a neutron star by a
stellar mass black hole, or of the merger of two neutron stars followed by
prompt gravitational collapse of the massive remnant. We discuss how the
available gamma-ray and X-ray data provide a probe for the nature of the
relativistic ejecta and the surrounding medium.",2005-06-06T03:02:13Z
A Thermal Graviton Background from Extra Dimensions,"Inflationary cosmology predicts a low-amplitude graviton background across a
wide range of frequencies. This Letter shows that if one or more extra
dimensions exist, the graviton background may have a thermal spectrum instead,
dependent on the fundamental scale of the extra dimensions. The energy density
is shown to be significant enough that it can affect nucleosynthesis in a
substantial way. The possibility of direct detection of a thermal graviton
background using the 21-cm hydrogen line is discussed. Alternative explanations
for the creation of a thermal graviton background are also examined.",2005-03-07T21:00:38Z
Detection of Cosmic Magnification with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,"We present an 8 sigma detection of cosmic magnification measured by the
variation of quasar density due to gravitational lensing by foreground large
scale structure. To make this measurement we used 3800 square degrees of
photometric observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) containing
\~200,000 quasars and 13 million galaxies. Our measurement of the galaxy-quasar
cross-correlation function exhibits the amplitude, angular dependence and
change in sign as a function of the slope of the observed quasar number counts
that is expected from magnification bias due to weak gravitational lensing. We
show that observational uncertainties (stellar contamination, Galactic dust
extinction, seeing variations and errors in the photometric redshifts) are well
controlled and do not significantly affect the lensing signal. By weighting the
quasars with the number count slope, we combine the cross-correlation of
quasars for our full magnitude range and detect the lensing signal at >4 sigma
in all five SDSS filters. Our measurements of cosmic magnification probe scales
ranging from 60 kpc/h to 10 Mpc/h and are in good agreement with theoretical
predictions based on the WMAP concordance cosmology. As with galaxy-galaxy
lensing, future measurements of cosmic magnification will provide useful
constraints on the galaxy-mass power spectrum.",2005-04-22T20:57:27Z
"An Analytic Model of Environmental Effects on Cosmic Structure Formation
  and an Application to Cosmic Accretion Shocks","We present a new analytic tool for the study of cosmic structure formation, a
double distribution of the number density of dark matter halos with respect to
both halo mass and local over- (or under-) density. The double distribution
provides a statistical treatment of the properties of matter surrounding
collapsed objects, and can be used to provide analytical insight into
environmental effects on hierarchical structure formation. We apply this new
tool to the case of cosmic accretion shocks. We investigate and quantify the
effect of environmental factors on the statistical properties of these shocks.
For this purpose, we explore two different models. The first control model uses
a Press-Schechter mass function to describe the population of collapsed
structures, and assumes that all objects accrete gas of the same density and
temperature. The second model treats the accreted material as a
multi-temperature, multi-density medium with densities and temperatures derived
from the double distribution. We find that the shock environment significantly
alters the physical impact of cosmic accretion shocks on the intergalactic
medium, as well as the cosmic history of their properties.",2005-04-21T21:29:49Z
"Further evidence for the presence of a neutron star in 4U 2206+54.
  INTEGRAL and VLA observations","The majority of High Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs) behave as X-ray pulsars,
revealing that they contain a magnetised neutron star. Among the four HMXBs not
showing pulsations, and that do not show the characteristics of accreting black
holes, there is the unusual HMXB 4U 2206+54. Here we present contemporaneous
high-energy and radio observations of this system conducted with INTEGRAL and
the VLA in order to unveil its nature. The high-energy spectra show clear
indications of the presence of an absorption feature at ~32 keV. This is the
third high-energy observatory which reveals marginal evidence of this feature,
giving strong support to the existence of a cyclotron resonance scattering
feature, which implies a magnetic field of 3.6 x 10^12 G. On the other hand,
the source is not detected at centimetre radio wavelengths with a 3 sigma upper
limit of 0.039 mJy. The expected radio emission for an accreting black hole in
the low/hard state, inferred from X-ray flux measurements, would be at least 60
times greater than the measured upper limit. Both results firmly indicate that,
in spite of the absence of pulsations, 4U 2206+54 hosts a magnetic accreting
neutron star, the first one not to be observed as an X-ray pulsar.",2005-02-24T21:01:08Z
"Eclipsing binaries in the Galactic Bulge: candidates for distance
  estimates","The 222~000 I-band light curves of variable stars detected by the OGLE-II
survey in the direction of the Galactic Bulge have been searched for eclipsing
binaries (EBs). A previously developed code to analyze lightcurve shapes and
identify long period variables (LPVs) has been adapted to identify EBs. The
parameters in the modified code have been optimised to recover a list of about
140 detached EBs in the Small Magellanic Cloud previously identified in the
literature as particularly well suited for distance estimates (and wich have
periods \more 0.85 days). The power of the code is demonstrated by identifying
16 and 178 previously uncatalogued EBs in the SMC and LMC, respectively. Among
the 222~000 variable stars in the direction of the Galactic Bulge 3053 EBs have
been identified. Periods and phased lightcurves are presented.",2005-05-06T14:08:32Z
On the survival and disruption of Earth mass CDM micro-haloes,"Neutralino dark matter leads to the formation of numerous earth mass dark
matter haloes at redshifts z\approx 60 (Diemand et al. 2005). These abundant
CDM micro-haloes have cuspy density profiles that can easily withstand the
Galactic tidal field at the solar radius. Zhao, Taylor, Silk & Hooper
(astro-ph/0502049) concluded that ``...the majority of dark matter
substructures with masses \sim 10^{-6}M_o will be tidally disrupted due to
interactions with stars in the Galactic halo''. However these authors assumed a
halo density of stars that is at least an order of magnitude higher than
observed. We show that the appropriate application of the impulse approximation
is to the regime of multiple encounters, not single disruptive events as
adopted by Zhao et al., which leads to a survival time of several Hubble times.
Therefore we do not expect the tidal heating by Galactic stars to affect the
abundance of micro-haloes. Disk crossing will cause some mass loss but the
central cores are likely to survive and could be detected as gamma-ray sources
with proper motions of several arc minutes per year.",2005-02-10T13:56:34Z
A Bayesian approach to filter design: detection of compact sources,"We consider filters for the detection and extraction of compact sources on a
background. We make a one-dimensional treatment (though a generalization to two
or more dimensions is possible) assuming that the sources have a Gaussian
profile whereas the background is modeled by an homogeneous and isotropic
Gaussian random field, characterized by a scale-free power spectrum. Local peak
detection is used after filtering. Then, a Bayesian Generalized Neyman-Pearson
test is used to define the region of acceptance that includes not only the
amplification but also the curvature of the sources and the a priori
probability distribution function of the sources. We search for an optimal
filter between a family of Matched-type filters (MTF) modifying the filtering
scale such that it gives the maximum number of real detections once fixed the
number density of spurious sources. We have performed numerical simulations to
test theoretical ideas.",2005-03-07T12:05:13Z
A Short and Personal History of the Spitzer Space Telescope,"The Spitzer Space Telescope, born as the Shuttle Infrared Telescope Facility
(SIRTF) and later the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (still SIRTF), was
under discussion and development within NASA and the scientific community for
more than 30 years prior to its launch in 2003. This brief history chronicles a
few of the highlights and the lowlights of those 30 years from the authors
personal perspective. A much more comprehensive history of SIRTF/Spitzer has
been written by George Rieke (2006).",2005-03-29T15:33:17Z
Inflationary spectra and violations of Bell inequalities,"In spite of the macroscopic character of the primordial fluctuations, the
standard inflationary distribution (that obtained using linear mode equations)
exhibits inherently quantum properties, that is, properties which cannot be
mimicked by any stochastic distribution. This is demonstrated by a Gedanken
experiment for which certain Bell inequalities are violated. These violations
are {\it in principle} measurable because, unlike for Hawking radiation from
black holes, in inflationary cosmology we can have access to both members of
correlated pairs of modes delivered in the same state. We then compute the
effect of decoherence and show that the violations persist provided the
decoherence level (and thus the entropy) lies below a certain non-vanishing
threshold. Moreover, there exists a higher threshold above which no violation
of any Bell inequality can occur. In this regime, the distributions are
``separable'' and can be interpreted as stochastic ensembles of fluctuations.
Unfortunately, the precision which is required to have access to the quantum
properties is so high that, {\it in practice}, an observational verification
seems excluded.",2005-05-18T13:49:01Z
Molecular Gas in Compact Galaxies,"New observations of 11 compact galaxies in the 12CO J=2-1 and J=3-2
transitions and literature data have been used to construct accurate line
ratios in matched beams allowing LVG modelling of physical parameters. Fitting
a single gas component to observed line ratios tends to produce physically
unrealistic results, and is often not possible at all. Much better results are
obtained by modelling two distinct gas components. The molecular gas is usually
warm (T(kin)=50-150 K) and at least partially dense (n(H2)>3000 cm3). Most of
the gas-phase carbon in these galaxies is in atomic form; only a small fraction
(5%) is in carbon monoxide. Beam-averaged CO column densities are low,
typically 10(16) cm2 but molecular hydrogen column densities are high, of the
order of 10(22) cm2 and confirm large CO-to-H2 conversion factors, typically X
= 10(21)-10(22) cm2(K kms-1) found in low-metallicity environments by other
methods. From CO spectroscopy, three different types of molecular environment
are distinguished in compact galaxies. Type I (high rotational and isotopic
ratios) corresponds to hot and dense molecular clouds dominated by star-forming
regions. Type II has lower ratios, similar to the mean found for
infrared-luminous galaxies in general, and corresponds to environments engaged
in, but not dominated by, star-forming activity. Type III, characterized by low
12CO (2--1)/(1--0) ratios, corresponds to mostly inactive environments of
relatively low density.",2005-04-26T09:21:46Z
"An Excess Due to Small Grains Around The Nearby K0V Star HD69830:
  Asteroid or Cometary Debris?","Spitzer photometry and spectroscopy of the star HD69830 reveal an excess of
emission relative to the stellar photosphere between 8 and 35 $\mu$m dominated
by strong features attributable to crystalline silicates with an emitting
surface area more than 1,000 times that of our zodiacal cloud. The spectrum
closely resembles that of the comet C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp). Since no excess is
detected at 70 $\mu$m, the emitting material must be quite warm, be confined
within a few AU of the star, and originate in grains with low long-wavelength
emissivity, i.e. grains much smaller than $70 \mu$m$/2\pi\sim 10 $ $\mu$m. The
strong mineralogical features are evidence for even smaller, possibly
sub-micron sized grains. This small grain size is in direct contrast to the
10-100 $\mu$m grains that dominate the relatively featureless spectra of our
zodiacal dust cloud and most other main sequence stars with excesses. The upper
limit at 70 $\mu$m also implies that any Kuiper Belt analog must either be very
cold or be less massive than $\sim$ 5 times our own Kuiper Belt.
  With collisional and Poynting-Robertson drag times of about a thousand years
for small grains, the emitting material must either: a) be created through
continual grinding down of material in a dense asteroid belt; or b) originate
in cometary debris arising from either a single ``super-comet'' or a very large
number of individual comets arriving from a distant reservoir. In the case of a
cometary origin for the emission, the mass requirements for continuous
generation by many individual comets are unreasonable and we favor the capture
of a single ``super comet'' into a 0.5-1 AU orbit where it can evolve a large
number of small grains over a 2 Myr period.",2005-04-22T00:59:43Z
"Dust Distribution in Gas Disks II: Self Induced Ring Formation Through a
  Clumping Instability","Debris rings of dust are found around young luminous stars such as HR4796A
and HD141569. Some of these entities have sharp edges and gaps which have been
interpreted as evidence for the presence of shepherding and embedded planets.
Here we show that gaps and sharp edges in the debris disks of dust can also be
spontaneously self generated if they are embedded in optically thin regions of
gaseous disks. This clumping instability arises in regions where an enhancement
in the dust density leads to local gas temperature and pressure increases.
Consequently, the relative motion between the gas and the dust is modified. The
subsequent hydrodynamic drag on the dust particles leads to further enhancement
of their concentration. We show that this process is linearly unstable and
leads to the formation of ring-like structures within the estimated life time
of such young objects. Once the gas is removed (e.g. by photo evaporation) the
structures are ``frozen'' and will persist, even when the gas might not be
observable anymore.",2005-02-25T11:35:20Z
ASCA and XMM-Newton Observations of A2029,"The X-ray data of A2029 obtained with XMM-Newton show no evidence of an
embedded AGN in the central region of this cluster, which was suggested from
the analysis of restored ASCA image data, although some hot spots are seen
within or around the central cD galaxy. The absence of AGN at the cluster
center is consistentent with the result of Chandra observations. Radial
profiles of the iron abundance and the 2D (surface) temperature obtained from
the XMM-Newton data are in good agreement with the Chandra data as a whole.",2005-04-12T12:02:47Z
High energy astrophysical processes,"We briefly review the high energy astrophysical processes that are related to
the production of high energy $\gamma$-ray and neutrino signals and are likely
to be important for the energy loss of high and ultrahigh energy cosmic rays.
We also give examples for neutrino fluxes generated by different astrophysical
objects and describe the cosmological link provided by cosmogenic neutrinos.",2005-04-18T20:27:45Z
The thinnest cold HI clouds in the diffuse interstellar medium?,"We confirm and discuss recently discovered cold HI clouds with column
densities among the lowest ever detected. The column densities of Cold Neutral
Medium (CNM) towards 3C286 and 3C287 are ~10^18 cm^-2, below an observational
lower limit, and also below tiny-scale-atomic clouds detected by VLBI and
time-variable profiles against pulsars. These column densities are close to the
minimum imposed by thermal evaporation. The fractions of the CNM to total HI
towards 3C286 and 3C287 are ~4% and <2%, respectively. We discuss the CNM
fraction and the CNM clouds in relation to several theoretical models.",2005-05-05T19:14:39Z
Crystalline Silicate Emission in the Protostellar Binary Serpens--SVS20,"We present spatially resolved mid-infrared spectroscopy of the class
I/flat-spectrum protostellar binary system SVS20 in the Serpens cloud core. The
spectra were obtained with the mid-infrared instrument T-ReCS on Gemini-South.
SVS20-South, the more luminous of the two sources, exhibits a mid-infrared
emission spectrum peaking near 11.3 \micron, while SVS20-North exhibits a
shallow amorphous silicate absorption spectrum with a peak optical depth of
$\tau \sim 0.3$. After removal of the the line-of-sight extinction by the
molecular common envelope, the ``protostar-only'' spectra are found to be
dominated by strong amorphous olivine emission peaking near 10 \micron. We also
find evidence for emission from crystalline forsterite and enstatite associated
with both SVS20-S and SVS20-N. The presence of crystalline silicate in such a
young binary system indicates that the grain processing found in more evolved
HAeBe and T Tauri pre-main sequence stars likely begins at a relatively young
evolutionary stage, while mass accretion is still ongoing.",2005-04-29T16:20:06Z
Constraints on the solid dark universe model,"If the dark energy is modelled as a relativistic elastic solid then the
standard CDM and $\Lambda$CDM models, as well as lattice configurations of
cosmic strings or domain walls, are points in the two-dimensional parameter
space $(w,c_{\rm s}^2)$. We present a detailed analysis of the best fitting
cosmological parameters in this model using data from a range of observations.
We find that the $\chi^2$ is improved by $\sim 10$ by including the two
parameters and that the $w=-1$ $\Lambda$CDM model is only the best fit to the
data when a large number of different datasets are included. Using CMB
observations alone we find that $w=-0.38\pm 0.16 $ and with the addition of
Large-Scale Structure data $w=-0.62\pm 0.15 $ and $\log c_{\rm s}=-0.77\pm
0.28$. We conclude that the models based on topological defects provide a good
fit to the current data, although $\Lambda$CDM cannot be ruled out.",2005-03-02T09:56:20Z
"Long-term optical photometric monitoring of the quasar SDSS
  J153259.96-003944.1","We report optical Cousins R and I band monitoring observations of the high
redshift (z = 4.67) QSO SDSS J153259.96-003944.1 that does not show detectable
emission lines in its optical spectrum. We show this object varies with a
maximum amplitude of ~0.4 mag during a year and three months of monitoring.
Combined with two other epochs of photometric data available in the literature,
we show the object has gradually faded by ~0.9 mag during the period June 1998
- April 2001. A linear least squares fit to all available observations gives a
slope of ~0.35 mag/yr which translates to ~1.9 mag/yr in the rest frame of the
quasar. Such a variability is higher than that typically seen in QSOs but
consistent with that of BL Lacs, suggesting that the optical continuum is
Doppler boosted. Alternatively, within photometric errors, the observed
lightcurve is also consistent with the object going through a microlensing
event. Photoionization model calculations show the mass of the Broad Line
Region to be few tens of solar mass similar to that of low luminosity Seyfert
galaxies, but about orders of magnitude less than that of luminous quasars.
Further frequent photometric/spectroscopic monitoring is needed to support or
refute the different alternatives discussed here on the nature of SDSS

MHD Interaction of Pulsar Wind Nebulae with SNRs and the ISM,"In the late 1960s the discovery of the Crab pulsar in its associated
supernova remnant, launched a new field in supernova remnant research: the
study of pulsar-driven or plerionic supernova remnants. In these type of
remnants, the relativistic wind emitted by the pulsar, blows a pulsar wind
nebula into the interior of its supernova remnant. Now, more then forty years
after the discovery of the Crab pulsar, there are more then fifty plerionic
supernova remnants known, due to the ever-increasing capacity of observational
facilities. I will review our current understanding of the different
evolutionary stages of a pulsar wind nebula as it is interacting with its
associated supernova remnant.Therefore I will discuss both analytical and more
recent numerical (M)HD models.The four main stages of a pulsar wind nebula are:
the supersonic expansion stage, the reverse shock interaction stage, the
subsonic expansion stage and ultimatelythe stage when the head of the bubble is
bounded by a bow shock, due to the supersonic motion of the pulsar. Ultimately
this pulsar wind nebula bow shock will break through its associated remnant,
after which the pulsar-powered bow shock will interact directly with the
interstellar medium. I will discuss recent numerical models from these type of
pulsar wind nebulae and their morphology.",2005-04-12T15:36:11Z
Luminosity and mass functions of galactic open clusters: II. NGC 4852,"e present wide field deep UBVI photometry for the previously unstudied open
cluster NGC 4852 down to a limiting magnitude $I\sim24$, obtained from
observations taken with the Wide Field Imager camera on-board the MPG/ESO 2.2m
telescope at La Silla (ESO, Chile). These data are used to obtain the first
estimate of the cluster basic parameters, to study the cluster spatial
extension by means of star counts, and to derive the Luminosity (LF) and Mass
Function (MF). The cluster radius turns out to be $5.0\pm1.0$ arcmin. The
cluster emerges clearly from the field down to V=20 mag. At fainter magnitud
es, it is completely confused with the general Galactic disk field. The stars
inside this region define a young open cluster (200 million years old) 1.1 kpc
far from the Sun (m-M = 11.60, E(B-V) = 0.45). The Present Day Mass Functions
(PDMF) from the $V$ photometry is one of the most extended in mass insofar
obtained, and can be represented as a power-law with a slope $\alpha =
2.3\pm0.3$ and (the Salpeter (1955) MF in this notation has a slope $\alpha =
2.35$), in the mass range $3.2 \leq \frac{m}{m_{\odot}} \leq 0.6$. Below this
mass, the MF cannot be considered as representative of the cluster MF, as the
cluster merges with the field and therefore the MF is the result of the
combined effect of strong irregularities in the stellar background and
interaction of the cluster with the dense Galactic field. The cluster total
mass at the limiting magnitude results to be 2570$\pm$210 M$_{\odot}$.",2005-02-15T14:13:31Z
Magnetic turbulence in cool cores of galaxy clusters,"We argue that the recently reported Kolmogorov-like magnetic turbulence
spectrum in the cool core of the Hydra A galaxy cluster can be understood by
kinetic energy injection by active galaxies that drives a turbulent non-helical
magnetic dynamo into its saturated state. Although dramatic differences exist
between small-scale dynamo scenarios, their saturated state is expected to be
similar, as we show for three scenarios: the flux rope dynamo, the fluctuation
dynamo, and the explosive dynamo. Based on those scenarios, we develop an
analytical model of the hydrodynamic and magnetic turbulence in cool cores. The
model implies magnetic field strengths that fit well with Faraday rotation
measurements and minimum energy estimates for the sample of cool core clusters
having such data available. Predictions for magnetic fields in clusters for
which the appropriate observational information is still missing, and for yet
unobserved quantities like the hydrodynamical turbulence velocity and
characteristic length-scale are provided. The underlying dynamo models suggest
magnetic intermittency and possibly a large-scale hydrodynamic viscosity. We
conclude that the success of the model to explain the field strength in cool
core clusters indicates that in general cluster magnetic fields directly
reflect hydrodynamical turbulence, also in clusters without cool cores.",2005-05-25T16:38:16Z
UCDs in Fornax and Abell 1689,"We review some properties of ultracompact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) in Fornax and
of their brighter counterparts in Abell 1689, among which are two M32 twins,
and discuss various possible UCD formation scenarios. We note that it is
indispensable to carefully take into account the bright end of the globular
cluster luminosity function when estimating the number density of UCDs. It is
suggested that the search for more luminous UCDs in dense and rich galaxy
clusters is the best way towards establishing UCDs as a new class of galaxies.",2005-05-10T12:07:07Z
The Importance of Off-Axis Beaming in Jet Models,"Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are widely thought to originate from collimated jets
of material moving at relativistic velocities. Emission from such a jet should
be visible even when viewed from outside the angle of collimation. Using Monte
Carlo population synthesis methods and including the effects of this off-axis
beaming, we can compare various GRB jet models against the global properties of
observed bursts. We explore whether or not the X-Ray Flashes (XRFs) seen by
HETE-2 and BeppoSAX can be explained as classical GRBs viewed off-axis, and
begin to address the more general question of the importance of off-axis
beaming in current burst samples.",2005-05-08T16:55:56Z
The Role of Magnetic Fields on Astrophysical Jets,"Highly collimated supersonic jets and less collimated outflows are observed
to emerge from a wide variety of astrophysical objects. They are seen in young
stellar objects (YSOs), proto-planetary nebulae, compact objects (such as
galactic black holes or microquasars, and X-ray binary stars), and in the
nuclei of active galaxies (AGNs). Despite their different physical scales (in
size, velocity, and amount of energy transported), they have strong
morphological similarities. What is the universal mechanism that can explain
their origin? In this lecture, I briefly review the role that magnetic fields
seem to play on the formation, structure, and propagation of these jets.",2005-05-25T22:19:50Z
Can a Gravitational Lens Magnify Gravity? A Possible Solar System Test,"Can a gravitational lens magnify gravity? Leading theories of gravity likely
indicate ""no"", but the possibility might be testable by using our Sun as a
gravitational lens and carefully aligning a satellite past the minimum
transparent focal distance of about 25 AU. Here the magnitude of a maximal
effect is estimated and found potentially observable.",2005-02-17T19:45:07Z
Turbulence Statistics from Spectral Line Observations,"Turbulence is a crucial component of dynamics of astrophysical fluids
dynamics, including those of ISM, clusters of galaxies and circumstellar
regions. Doppler shifted spectral lines provide a unique source of information
on turbulent velocities. We discuss Velocity-Channel Analysis (VCA) and its
offspring Velocity Coordinate Spectrum (VCS) that are based on the analytical
description of the spectral line statistics. Those techniques are well suited
for studies of supersonic turbulence. We stress that a great advantage of VCS
is that it does not necessary require good spatial resolution. Addressing the
studies of mildly supersonic and subsonic turbulence we discuss the criterion
that allows to determine whether Velocity Centroids are dominated by density or
velocity. We briefly discuss ways of going beyond power spectra by using of
higher order correlations as well as genus analysis. We outline the relation
between Spectral Correlation Functions and the statistics available through VCA
and VCS.",2005-05-28T23:13:26Z
Probing dark matter caustics with weak lensing,"Caustics are high-density structures that form frequently in collisionless
media. Under self-gravity, cold dark matter flows focus onto caustics which are
yet to be resolved in numerical simulations and or observed in the real world.
If detected, caustics would provide a strong evidence for dark matter and would
rule out alternative models such as those with modified dynamics. Here, we
demonstrate how they might be observed in the weak lensing data. We evaluate
the shear distortion and show that its radial profile is marked by a
characteristic sawtooth pattern due to the caustics in dark matter haloes that
form by selfsimilar accretion. We discuss the observational complications,
mainly due to the poor knowledge of the virial radii of the haloes and
demonstrate that a superposition of about 300 cluster-size haloes would give a
signal-to-noise ratio which is sufficiently large for the detection of caustics
with ground-based observations. This number is reduced to 100 for space-based
observations. These bounds can be easily achieved by the ongoing wide field
optical surveys such as CFHTLS and the future space-based projects SNAP and
DUNE which have to be accompanied by a X-ray follow-up of the selected clusters
for a precise determination of their virial radii.",2005-06-02T15:36:22Z
"The Radial Distribution of Magnetic Helicity in the Solar Convective
  Zone: Observations and Dynamo Theory","We continue our attempt to connect observational data on current helicity in
solar active regions with solar dynamo models. In addition to our previous
results about temporal and latitudinal distributions of current helicity
(Kleeorin et al. 2003), we argue that some information concerning the radial
profile of the current helicity averaged over time and latitude can be
extracted from the available observations. The main feature of this
distribution can be presented as follows. Both shallow and deep active regions
demonstrate a clear dominance of one sign of current helicity in a given
hemisphere during the whole cycle. Broadly speaking, current helicity has
opposite polarities in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, although there
are some active regions that violate this polarity rule. The relative number of
active regions violating the polarity rule is significantly higher for deeper
active regions. A separation of active regions into `shallow', `middle' and
`deep' is made by comparing their rotation rate and the helioseismic rotation
law. We use a version of Parker's dynamo model in two spatial dimensions, that
employs a nonlinearity based on magnetic helicity conservation arguments. The
predictions of this model about the radial distribution of solar current
helicity appear to be in remarkable agreement with the available observational
data; in particular the relative volume occupied by the current helicity of
""wrong"" sign grows significantly with the depth.",2005-03-30T12:31:37Z
"Ab Initio Calculation of the Anomalous Acceleration of Pioneer 10 In

a simple optical model. The model is based on the bending of background gravity

ponderable matter about the Solar system, neutron stars, and galaxies are
described. Viewable red and blue shiftings of light are predicted.",2005-02-28T16:46:47Z
"Proper Motions as an Underutilized Tool for Estimating Distances and
  Ages for Nearby, Young Stars","The recent availability of accurate proper motion catalogs for millions of
stars on the sky (e.g. Tycho-2, UCAC) can benefit projects for which age
estimates are needed for stars that are plausibly young (<100 Myr-old) and
within a few hundred pc of the Sun. Here I summarize how accurate proper
motions have been useful in (1) identifying new, nearby, post-T Tauri star
populations, and (2) estimating distances to young field stars which are
lacking trigonometric parallax measurements. The later enables the calculation

Statistical Properties of Dissipative MHD Accelerators,"We use exact orbit integration to investigate particle acceleration in a
Gauss field proxy of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. Regions where the
electric current exceeds a critical threshold are declared to be `dissipative'
and endowed with super-Dreicer electric field ${\bf E}_\Omega = \eta {\bf j}$.
In this environment, test particles (electrons) are traced and their
acceleration to relativistic energies is studied. As a main result we find that
acceleration mostly takes place within the dissipation regions, and that the
momentum increments have heavy (non-Gaussian) tails, while the waiting times
between the dissipation regions are approximately exponentially distributed
with intensity proportional to the particle velocity. No correlation between
the momentum increment and the momentum itself is found. Our numerical results
suggest an acceleration scenario with ballistic transport between independent
`black box' accelerators.",2005-03-07T14:41:03Z
"Particle acceleration, magnetic field generation, and emission in
  relativistic pair jets","Shock acceleration is a ubiquitous phenomenon in astrophysical plasmas.
Plasma waves and their associated instabilities (e.g., Buneman, Weibel and
other two-stream instabilities) created in collisionless shocks are responsible
for particle (electron, positron, and ion) acceleration. Using a 3-D
relativistic electromagnetic particle (REMP) code, we have investigated
particle acceleration associated with a relativistic jet front propagating into
an ambient plasma. We find that the growth times of Weibel instability are
proportional to the Lorentz factors of jets. Simulations show that the Weibel
instability created in the collisionless shock front accelerates jet and
ambient particles both perpendicular and parallel to the jet propagation
direction.",2005-02-16T21:26:21Z
How many dark energy parameters?,"For exploring the physics behind the accelerating universe a crucial question
is how much we can learn about the dynamics through next generation
cosmological experiments. For example, in defining the dark energy behavior
through an effective equation of state, how many parameters can we
realistically expect to tightly constrain? Through both general and specific
examples (including new parametrizations and principal component analysis) we
argue that the answer is 42 - no, wait, two. Cosmological parameter analyses
involving a measure of the equation of state value at some epoch (e.g. w_0) and
a measure of the change in equation of state (e.g. w') are therefore realistic
in projecting dark energy parameter constraints. More elaborate
parametrizations could have some uses (e.g. testing for bias or comparison with
model features), but do not lead to accurately measured dark energy parameters.",2005-05-16T20:04:07Z
Discovery of X-ray Jets in the Microquasar H 1743-322,"We report on the formation and evolution of two large-scale,
synchrotron-emitting jets from the black hole candidate H 1743-322 following
its reactivation in 2003. In November 2003 after the end of its 2003 outburst,
we noticed, in observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, the
presence of a new and variable radio source about 4.6"" to the East of H
1743-322, that was later found to move away from H 1743-322. In February 2004,
we detected a radio source to the West of H 1743-322, symmetrically placed
relative to the Eastern jet. In 2004, follow-up X-ray observations with {\em
Chandra} led to the discovery of X-ray emission associated with the two radio
sources. This likely indicates that we are witnessing the interaction of
relativistic jets from H 1743-322 with the interstellar medium causing in-situ
particle acceleration. The spectral energy distribution of the jets during the
decay phase is consistent with a classical synchrotron spectrum of a single
electron distribution from radio up to X-rays, implying the production of very
high energy ($>$ 10 TeV) particles in those jets. We discuss the jet
kinematics, highlighting the presence of a significantly relativistic flow in H
1743-322 almost a year after the ejection event.",2005-05-26T08:27:31Z
"The size evolution of galaxies since z~3: combining SDSS, GEMS and FIRES","We present the evolution of the luminosity-size and stellar mass-size
relations of luminous (L_V>3.4x10^10h_70^-2L_sun) and of massive
(M_*>3x10^10h_70^-2M_sun) galaxies in the last ~11 Gyr. We use very deep
near-infrared images of the Hubble Deep Field-South and the MS1054-03 field in
the J_s, H and K_s bands from FIRES to retrieve the sizes in the optical
rest-frame for galaxies with z>1. We combine our results with those from GEMS
at 0.2<z<1 and SDSS at z~0.1 to achieve a comprehensive picture of the optical
rest-frame size evolution from z=0 to z=3. Galaxies are differentiated
according to their light concentration using the Sersic index n. For less
concentrated objects, the galaxies at a given luminosity were typically ~3+-0.5
(+-2 sigma) times smaller at z~2.5 than those we see today. The stellar
mass-size relation has evolved less: the mean size at a given stellar mass was
\~2+-0.5 times smaller at z~2.5, evolving proportional to (1+z)^{-0.40+-0.06}.
Simple scaling relations between dark matter halos and baryons in a
hierarchical cosmogony predict a stronger (although consistent within the error
bars) than observed evolution of the stellar mass-size relation. The observed
luminosity-size evolution out to z~2.5 matches well recent infall model
predictions for Milky-Way type objects. For low-n galaxies, the evolution of
the stellar mass-size relation would follow naturally if the individual
galaxies grow inside-out. For highly concentrated objects, the situation is as
follows: at a given luminosity, these galaxies were ~2.7+-1.1 times smaller at
z~2.5 (or put differently, were typically ~2.2+-0.7 mag brighter at a given
size than they are today), and at a given stellar mass the size has evolved
proportional to (1+z)^{-0.45+-0.10}.",2005-04-09T15:35:51Z
"The search for optical emission on and before the GRB trigger with the
  WIDGET telescope","WIDGET is a robotic telescope for monitoring the HETE-2 field-of-view to
detect Gamma-ray Burst optical flashes or possible optical precursors. The

with a 2kx2k Apogee U10 CCD camera and a Canon EF 24mm f/1.4 wide-angle lens
without a bandpass filter. WIDGET has been in operation since June 2004 at
Akeno observing site where is about 200 km apart from Tokyo. Typical limiting
magnitude with S/N=3 at the site is V=10mag for 5 seconds exposure and V=11mag
for 30 seconds exposure. We had already six coincident observations with HETE-2
position alerts. It was, however, cloudy for all cases due to rainy season in
Japan. Expected number of coincident observations under clear sky is about 5
events per year. We will extend the system in early 2005 for Swift era to

Jupiter's Obliquity and a Long-lived Circumplanetary Disk,"It has been claimed (Canup and Ward 2002; Ward 2003) that a long-lived
massive (compared to the mass of the Galilean satellites) circumplanetary gas
disk is inconsistent with Jupiter's low obliquity. Such a constraint could be
downplayed on the basis that it deals with a single observation. Here we argue
that this argument is flawed because it assumes a solar system much like that
of the present day with the one exception of a circumjovian disk which is then
allowed to dissipate on a long timescale (10^6-10^7 yrs). Given that the
sequence of events in solar-system history that fit known constraints is
non-unique, we choose for the sake of clarity of exposition the orbital
architecture framework of Tsiganis et al. (2005), in which Jupiter and Saturn
were once in closer, less inclined orbits than they are at present, and show
that Jupiter's low obliquity is consistent with the SEMM (solids-enhanced
minimum mass) satellite formation model of Mosqueira and Estrada (2003a,b).",2005-06-07T18:00:28Z
"Detailed analysis of open clusters: a mass function break and evidence
  of a fundamental plane","We derive photometric, structural and dynamical evolution-related parameters
of 11 nearby open clusters with ages in the range 70 Myr to 7 Gyr and masses in
the range $\approx400$ \ms to $\approx5 300$ \ms. We search for relations of
structural and evolutionary parameters with age and Galactocentric distance.
The main results for the present sample are: {\em (i)} cluster size correlates
both with age and Galactocentric distance; {\em (ii)} because of size and mass
scaling, core and limiting radii, and core and overall mass correlate; {\em
(iii)} massive ($\rm m\geq1 000$ \ms) and less-massive clusters follow separate
correlation paths on the plane core radius and overall mass; {\em (iv)} MF
slopes of massive clusters are restricted to a narrow range, while those of the
less-massive ones distribute over a wider range. Core and overall MF flattening
is related to the ratio ($\tau$) of age to relaxation time. For large values of
$\tau$ the effects of large-scale mass segregation and low-mass stars
evaporation can be observed in the MFs. In this sense, $\tau$ appears to
characterize the evolutionary state of the clusters. We conclude that
appreciable slope flattenings in the overall MFs of the less-massive clusters
take $\sim6$ times longer to occur than in the core, while in the massive
clusters they take a time $\sim13$ times longer. We investigate cluster
parameters equivalent to those determining the fundamental plane of
ellipticals. These parameters are: overall mass, projected mass density and
core radius. We conclude that in the present sample there is evidence of a
fundamental plane.",2005-03-28T13:10:42Z
"Modeling star formation in dwarf spheroidal galaxies: a case for
  extended dark matter halos","We propose a simple model for the formation of dwarf spheroidal galaxies, in
which stars are assumed to have formed from isothermal gas in hydrostatic
equilibrium inside extended dark matter halos. After expelling the leftover
gas, the stellar system undergoes a dynamical relaxation inside the dark matter
halo. These models can adequately describe the observed properties of three
(Draco, Sculptor, and Carina) out of four Galactic dwarf spheroidal satellites
studied in this paper. We suggest that the fourth galaxy (Fornax), which cannot
be fitted well with our model, is observed all the way to its tidal radius. Our
best fitting models have virial masses of ~10^9 M_Sun, halo formation redshifts
consistent with the age of oldest stars in these dwarfs, and shallow inner dark
matter density profiles (with slope gamma -0.5...0). The inferred temperature
of gas is ~10^4 K. In our model, the ""extratidal"" stars observed in the
vicinity of some dwarf spheroidal galaxies are gravitationally bound to the
galaxies and are a part of the extended stellar halos. The inferred virial
masses make Galactic dwarf spheroidals massive enough to alleviate the ""missing
satellites"" problem of LCDM cosmologies.",2005-02-06T16:53:48Z

X-rays from Cepheus A East and West,"We report the discovery of X-rays from both components of Cepheus A, East and
West, with the XMM-Newton Observatory. HH 168 joins the ranks of other
energetic Herbig Haro objects that are sources of T~10^6 K X-ray emission. The
HH 168 effective temperature is T = 5.8 (+3.5,-2.3) x 10^6 K and its unabsorbed
luminosity is 1.1 x 10^29 erg s^-1, making it hotter and less luminous than
other representatives of its class. We also detect prominent X-ray emission
from the complex of compact radio sources believed to be the power sources for
Cep A. We call this source HWX and it is distinguished by its hard X-ray
spectrum, T = 1.2 (+1.2,-0.5) x 10^8 K, and complex spatial distribution. It
may arise from one or more protostars associated with the radio complex, the
outflows, or a combination of the two. We detect 102 X-rays sources; many
presumed to be pre-main sequence stars based upon the reddening of their

"Mid-Infrared Imaging of Active Galaxies: Active Nuclei and Embedded Star
  Clusters","High resolution, mid-infrared (MIR) images of a set of nine nearby active
galaxies are presented. The data were obtained with the TIMMI2 instrument
mounted at the ESO 3.6m telescope using a set of N-band narrow filters. The
resulting images have an angular resolution of 0.6""-1"". The MIR emission has
been resolved in four galaxies: NGC253, NGC1365, NGC1808 and NGC7469. The
images unveil a circumnuclear population of unknown MIR sources in NGC1365 and
NGC1808, coincident with radio sources. These MIR/radio sources are interpreted
in terms of embedded young star clusters. A high-resolution MIR map of NGC253
is also presented, and enables the identification of a previously unknown MIR
counterpart to the radio nucleus. Extended MIR emission is detected in NGC7469,
and concurs with previous observations in the NIR and radio. For this source,
an interesting morphological difference between the 10.4mic and the 11.9mic
emission is observed, suggesting the presence of a dust-rich micro-bar. Our MIR
images of Circinus do not show resolved emission from the nucleus down to an
angular scale of 0.5"". In the case of NGC2992, an upper limit to the extended
MIR emission can be set. Finally, we provide new MIR flux measurements for the
unresolved AGN in NGC5995, IZw1 and IIZw136.",2005-04-05T16:47:13Z
"Gravoturbulent Star Formation: Effects of the Equation of State on
  Stellar Masses","Stars form by gravoturbulent fragmentation of interstellar gas clouds. The
supersonic turbulence ubiquitously observed in Galactic molecular gas generates
strong density fluctuations with gravity taking over in the densest and most
massive regions. Collapse sets in to build up stars and star clusters.
  Turbulence plays a dual role. On global scales it provides support, while at
the same time it can promote local collapse. Stellar birth is thus intimately
linked to the dynamic behavior of parental gas clouds, which governs when and
where protostellar cores form, and how they contract and grow in mass via
accretion from the surrounding cloud material to build up stars. The equation
of state plays a pivotal role in the fragmentation process. Under typical cloud
conditions, massive stars form as part of dense clusters following the ""normal""
mass function observed, e.g. in the solar neighborhood. However, for gas with
an effective polytropic index greater than unity star formation becomes biased
towards isolated massive stars. This is relevant for understanding the
properties of zero-metallicity stars (Population III) or stars that form under
extreme environmental conditions like in the Galactic center or in luminous
starbursts.",2005-06-15T16:43:05Z
Encounters between spherical galaxies II: systems with dark halo,"We performe N-body simulations of encounters between spherical systems
surrounded by a spherical halo. Following a preceding paper with a similar aim,
the initial systems include a spherical Jaffe model for the luminous matter and
a Hernquist model for the halo. The merger remnants from this sample are mainly
slowly rotating, prolate spheroids with a radially anisotropic velocity
distribution. The results are compared with real-life ellipticals and with the
models without halo in paper I. We argue that elliptical galaxies with evidence
of dark matter could be formed in the field via a merger of spheroids
surrounded by a dark matter halo, while ellipticals with no evidence of dark
matter might be formed via a merger of two spheroids in a cluster.",2005-06-01T15:09:35Z
"The puzzling case of GRB 990123: prompt emission and broad-band
  afterglow modeling","We report on BeppoSAX simultaneous X- and gamma-ray observations of the
bright GRB 990123. We present the broad-band spectrum of the prompt emission,
including optical, X- and gamma-rays, confirming the suggestion that the
emission mechanisms at low and high frequencies must have different physical
origins. In the framework of the standard fireball model, we discuss the X-ray
afterglow observed by the NFIs and its hard X-ray emission up to 60 keV several
hours after the burst, detected for about 20 ks by the PDS. Considering the
2-10 keV and optical light curves, the 0.1-60 keV spectrum during the 20 ks in
which the PDS signal was present and the 8.46 GHz upper limits, we find that
the multi-wavelength observations cannot be readily accommodated by basic
afterglow models. While the temporal and spectral behavior of the optical
afterglow is possibly explained by a synchrotron cooling frequency between the
optical and the X-ray energy band during the NFIs observations, in X-rays this
assumption only accounts for the slope of the 2-10 keV light curve, but not for
the flatness of the 0.1-60 keV spectrum. Including the contribution of Inverse
Compton (IC) scattering, we solve the problem of the flat X-ray spectrum and
justify the hard X-ray emission; we suggest that the lack of a significant
detection of 15-60 keV emission in the following 75 ks and last 70 ks spectra,
should be related to poorer statistics rather than to an important suppression
of IC contribution. However, considering also the radio band data, we find the
8.46 GHz upper limits violated. On the other hand, leaving unchanged the
emission mechanism requires modifying the hydrodynamics by invoking an ambient
medium whose density rises rapidly with radius and by having the shock losing
energy. Thus we are left with an open puzzle which requires further inspection.",2005-04-27T17:35:18Z
"A semi-relativistic approach to the circular restricted three body
  problem and a numerical experiment around the 3:2 resonance","A Hamiltonian that approaches the study of the three-body problem in general
relativity is obtained. We use it to study the relativistic version of the
circular restricted three-body problem in which the first body is the heaviest
and the third body is a test-particle. We focus on the orbits around the 3:2
resonance. We show that, in spite of the notable difference between the
relativistic and Newtonian orbits, most of the resonant region is preserved.
Nevertheless, differently from the Newtonian case, the frequencies between the
second and the third body are no longer commensurable.",2005-02-15T02:55:31Z
"Identification of Main Sequence Stars with Mid-Infrared Excesses Using
  GLIMPSE: Beta-Pictoris Analogs?","Spitzer IRAC 3.6-8 micron photometry obtained as part of the GLIMPSE survey
has revealed mid-infrared excesses for 33 field stars with known spectral types
in a 1.2 sq. degree field centered on the southern Galactic HII region RCW49.
These stars comprise a subset of 184 stars with known spectral classification,
most of which were pre-selected to have unusually red IR colors. We propose
that the mid-IR excesses are caused by circumstellar dust disks that are either
very late remnants of stellar formation or debris disks generated by planet
formation. Of these 33 stars, 29 appear to be main-sequence stars based on
optical spectral classifications. Five of the 29 main-sequence stars are O or B
stars with excesses that can be plausibly explained by thermal bremsstrahlung
emission, and four are post main-sequence stars. The lone O star is an O4V((f))
at a spectrophotometric distance of 3233+ 540- 535 pc and may be the earliest
member of the Westerlund 2 cluster. Of the remaining 24 main-sequence stars, 18
have SEDs that are consistent with hot dusty debris disks, a possible signature
of planet formation. Modeling the excesses as blackbodies demonstrates that the
blackbody components have fractional bolometric disk-to-star luminosity ratios,
LIR/L*, ranging from 10^-3 to 10^-2 with temperatures ranging from 220 to 820
K. The inferred temperatures are more consistent with asteroid belts rather
than the cooler temperatures expected for Kuiper belts. Mid-IR excesses are
found in all spectral types from late B to early K.",2005-04-20T17:08:42Z

density greatly exceeds the plasma rest mass density (magnetically dominated
limit). The underlying physics is derived from published three-dimensional

Galactic Chemical Evolution Redux: Atomic Numbers 6 < Z < 15,"Motivated by the inability of Galactic chemical evolution models to reproduce
some of the observed solar neighbourhood distribution of elements (and
isotopes) with atomic numbers 6 < Z < 15, we have revisited the relevant
stellar and Galactic models as part of an ambitious new program aimed at
resolving these long-standing discrepancies. Avoiding the use of (traditional)
parametric models for low- and intermediate-mass stellar evolution, we have
generated a new, physically self-consistent, suite of stellar models and
integrated the nucleosynthetic outputs into GEtool, our semi-analytical
galactic chemical evolution software package. The predicted temporal evolution
of several light- and intermediate-mass elements (and their isotopes) in the
solar neighbourhood - from carbon to phosphorus - demonstrate the efficacy of
the new yields in reconciling theory and observation.",2005-02-15T01:46:53Z
Evolutionary Consequences of Dusty Tori in Active Galactic Nuclei,"Deep surveys of {\em Chandra} and {\em HST} (Hubble Space Telescope) show
that active galactic nucleus (AGN) populations are changing with hard X-ray
luminosities. This arises an interesting question whether the dusty torus is
evolving with the central engines. We assemble a sample of 50 radio-quiet PG
quasars to tackle this problem. The covering factors of the dusty tori can be
estimated from the multiwavelength continuum. We find they are strongly
correlated with the hard X-ray luminosity. Interestingly this correlation
agrees with the fraction of type II AGNs discovered by {\em Chandra} and {\em
HST}, implying strong evidence for that the AGN population changing results
from the evolution of the tori. We also find that the frequencies of the dips
around 1$\mu$m in the continuum correlate with the covering factors in the
present sample, indicating the dip frequencies are adjusted by the covering
factors. In the scenario of fueling black hole from the torus, the covering
factor is a good and the dip frequency is a potential indicator of the torus
evolution.",2005-05-20T01:41:38Z
The Excess Far-Infrared Emission of AGN in the Local Universe,"We have cross-correlated the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) second data
release spectroscopic galaxy sample with the IRAS faint-source catalogue (FSC).
Optical emission line ratios are used to classify the galaxies with reliable
IRAS 60 and 100 microns detections into AGN and normal star-forming galaxies.
We then create subsamples of normal galaxies and AGN that are very closely
matched in terms of key physical properties such as stellar mass, redshift,
size, concentration and mean stellar age (as measured by absorption line
indicators in the SDSS spectra). We then quantify whether there are systematic
differences between the IR luminosities of the galaxies and the AGN in the
matched subsamples. We find that the AGN exhibit a significant excess in far-IR
emission relative to the star-forming galaxies in our sample. The excesses at
60 and 100 microns are 0.21 +/- 0.03 dex and 0.12 +/- 0.035 dex in
log[L(60)/M*] and log[L(100)/M*], respectively. We then discuss whether the
far-IR excess is produced by radiation from the active nucleus that is absorbed
by dust or alternatively, by an extra population of young stars that is not
detectable at optical wavelengths.",2005-06-16T14:42:00Z
Parsec-scale X-ray Flows in High-mass Star-forming Regions,"The Chandra X-ray Observatory is providing remarkable new views of massive
star-forming regions, revealing all stages in the life cycle of high-mass stars

high-mass star-forming regions, highlighting physical processes that
characterize the life of a cluster of high-mass stars, from deeply-embedded
cores too young to have established an HII region to superbubbles so large that
they shape our views of galaxies. Along the way we see that X-ray observations
reveal hundreds of stellar sources powering great HII region complexes,
suffused by both hard and soft diffuse X-ray structures caused by fast O-star
winds thermalized in wind-wind collisions or by termination shocks against the
surrounding media. Finally, we examine the effects of the deaths of high-mass
stars that remained close to their birthplaces, exploding as supernovae within
the superbubbles that these clusters created. We present new X-ray results on
W51 IRS2E and 30 Doradus and we introduce new data on Trumpler 14 in Carina and

"Measuring the Three-Dimensional Structure of Galaxy Clusters. I.
  Application to a Sample of 25 Clusters","We discuss a method to constrain the intrinsic three-dimensionale shapes of
galaxy clusters by combining X-Ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich observations. The
method is applied to a sample of 25 X-Ray selected clusters, with measured
Sunyaev-Zeldovich temperature decrements. The sample turns out to be slightly
biased, with strongly elongated clusters preferentially aligned along the line
of sight. This result demonstrates that X-Ray selected cluster samples may be
affected by morphological and orientation effects even if a relatively high
threshold signal-to-noise ratio is used to select the sample. A large majority
of the clusters in our sample exhibit a marked triaxial structure, with
prolate-like shapes being slightly more likely than oblate-like ones; the
spherical hypothesis is strongly rejected for most sample members. Cooling flow
clusters do not show preferentially regular morphologies.",2005-02-08T01:33:12Z
"Dynamical and Pressure Structures in Winds with Multiple Embedded
  Evaporating Clumps I. 2D Numerical Simulations","Because of its key role in feedback in star formation and galaxy formation,
we examine the nature of the interaction of a flow with discrete sources of
mass injection. We show the results of two-dimensional numerical simulations in
which we explore a range of configurations for the mass sources and study the
effects of their proximity on the downstream flow. The mass sources act
effectively as a single source of mass injection if they are so close together
that the ratio of their combined mass injection rate is comparable to or
exceeds the mass flux of the incident flow into the volume that they occupy.
The simulations are relevant to many diffuse sources, such as planetary nebulae
and starburst superwinds, in which a global flow interacts with material
evaporating or being ablated from the surface of globules of cool, dense gas.",2005-06-15T13:53:19Z
"Astrophysical Implications of Turbulent Reconnection: from cosmic rays
  to star formation","Turbulent reconnection allows fast magnetic reconnection of astrophysical
magnetic fields. This entails numerous astrophysical implications and opens new
ways to approach long standing problems. I briefly discuss a model of turbulent
reconnection within which the stochasticity of 3D magnetic field enables rapid
reconnection through both allowing multiple reconnection events to take place
simultaneously and by restricting the extension of current sheets. In fully
ionized gas the model in Lazarian and Vishniac 99 predicts reconnection rates
that depend only on the intensity of turbulence. In partially ionized gas a
modification of the original model in Lazarian, Vishniac and Cho 04 predicts
the reconnection rates that, apart from the turbulence intensity depend on the
degree of ionization. In both cases the reconnection may be slow and fast
depending on the level of turbulence in the system. As the result, the
reconnection gets bursty, which provides a possible explanation to Solar flares
and possibly to gamma ray busts. The implications of the turbulent reconnection
model have not been yet studied in sufficient detail. I discuss first order
Fermi acceleration of cosmic ray that takes place as the oppositely directed
magnetic fluxes move together. This acceleration would work in conjunction with
the second order Fermi acceleration that is caused by turbulence in the
reconnection region. In partially ionized gas the stochastic reconnection
enables fast removal of magnetic flux from star forming molecular clouds.",2005-05-28T22:52:54Z
QSO Narrow [OIII] Line Width and Host Galaxy Luminosity,"Galaxy bulge luminosity L, black hole mass (Mbh), and stellar velocity
dispersion (sigma_*) increase together in a way suggesting a close evolutionary
relationship. Measurements of the Mbh-sigma_* relationship as a function of
cosmic time may shed light on the origin of this relationship. Direct
measurements of sigma_* at high redshift are difficult, and the width of the
narrow emission lines of AGN has been proposed as a surrogate. We investigate
the utility of using sigma_[OIII] for sigma_* by examining host galaxy
magnitudes and [OIII] line widths for low redshift QSOs. For radio-quiet QSOs,
sigma_[OIII] is consistent in the mean with the value of sigma_* predicted by
the Faber-Jackson relation. For our limited range of host luminosity, scatter
obscures the expected increase of sigma_[OIII] with host luminosity. However,
for a sample of AGN covering a wide range of measured or inferred sigma_*,
there is a clear increase of sigma_[OIII] with sigma_*. Radio-loud QSOs on
average have sigma_* smaller by ~0.1 dex than radio-quiet QSOs of similar host
luminsotiy, at least for luminosities typical of PG QSOs. Star formation rates
in our low redshift QSOs are smaller than required to maintain the typical
observed ratio of bulge mass to black hole mass.",2005-03-02T15:48:58Z

from transient sources distributed throughout the cosmos. Because of source
rate density evolution and variation of cosmological volume elements, the
sources first detected when the machine is switched on are likely to be ones in
the high-redshift universe; as observation time increases, rarer, more local,
events will be found. We characterize the observer's evolving record of events
in terms of a ""probability event horizon"", converging on the observer from
great distances at enormous speed, and illustrate it by simulating neutron star
birth events distributed throughout the cosmos. As an initial application of
the concept, we determine the approach of this horizon for gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) by fitting to redshift data. The event rates required to fit the model
are consistent with the proposed link between core-collapse supernovae and a
largely undetected population of faint GRBs.",2005-05-10T03:16:22Z
The Distribution of Satellite Galaxies in a Lambda-CDM Universe,"We compute the locations of satellite galaxies with respect to their hosts
using the Lambda-CDM GIF simulation. If the major axes of the hosts' images are
perfectly aligned with the major axes of their projected mass, the satellites
are located preferentially close to the hosts' major axes. In this case, the
degree of anisotropy in the satellite locations is a good tracer of the
flattening of the hosts' halos. If all hosts have luminous circular disks, the
symmetry axes of the projected mass and light are not perfectly aligned, and
the locations of the satellites depend upon how the hosts' disks are placed
within their halos. If the disk angular momentum vectors are aligned with the
major axes of the halos, the satellites show a pronounced ""Holmberg effect"". If
the disk angular momentum vectors are aligned with the intermediate axes of the
local large scale structure, the distribution of satellite locations is
essentially isotropic. If the disk angular momentum vectors are aligned with
either the minor axes or with the net angular momentum vectors of the halos,
the satellites are distributed anisotropically about their hosts, with a
preference for being found nearby the hosts' major axes. This agrees well with
the observation that satellite galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey tend to
be found nearby the major axes of their hosts, and suggests that the mass and
light of SDSS host galaxies must be fairly well aligned in projection on the
sky.",2005-05-12T22:35:05Z
Henry Kandrup's Ideas About Relaxation of Stellar Systems,"Henry Kandrup wrote prolifically on the problem of relaxation of stellar
systems. His picture of relaxation was significantly more refined than the
standard description in terms of phase mixing and violent relaxation. In this
article, I summarize Henry's work in this and related areas.",2005-02-08T20:26:23Z
A galaxy-halo model of large-scale structure,"We present a new, galaxy-halo model of large-scale structure, in which the
galaxies entering a given sample are the fundamental objects. Haloes attach to
galaxies, in contrast to the standard halo model, in which galaxies attach to
haloes. The galaxy-halo model pertains mainly to the relationships between the
power spectra of galaxies and mass, and their cross-power spectrum. With
surprisingly little input, an intuition-aiding approximation to the
galaxy-matter cross-correlation coefficient R(k) emerges, in terms of the halo
mass dispersion. This approximation seems valid to mildly non-linear scales (k
< ~3 h/Mpc), allowing measurement of the bias and the matter power spectrum
from measurements of the galaxy and galaxy-matter power spectra (or correlation
functions). This is especially relevant given the recent advances in precision
in measurements of the galaxy-matter correlation function from weak
gravitational lensing. The galaxy-halo model also addresses the issue of
interpreting the galaxy-matter correlation function as an average halo density
profile, and provides a simple description of galaxy bias as a function of
scale.",2005-04-06T20:11:09Z
The Small-Scale Power Spectrum of Cold Dark Matter,"One of the best motivated hypotheses in cosmology states that most of the
matter in the universe is in the form of weakly-interacting massive particles
that decoupled early in the history of the universe and cooled adiabatically to
an extremely low temperature. Nevertheless, the finite temperature and horizon
scales at which these particles decoupled imprint generic signatures on their
small scales density fluctuations. We show that the previously recognized
cut-off in the fluctuation power-spectrum due to free-streaming of particles at
the thermal speed of decoupling, is supplemented by acoustic oscillations owing
to the initial coupling between the cold dark matter (CDM) and the radiation
field. The power-spectrum oscillations appear on the scale of the horizon at
thermal decoupling which corresponds to a mass scale of
\~10^{-4}*(T_d/10MeV)^{-3} solar masses for a CDM decoupling temperature T_d.
The suppression of the power-spectrum on smaller scales by the acoustic
oscillations is physically independent from the free-streaming effect, although
the two cut-off scales are coincidentally comparable for T_d~10MeV and a
particle mass of M~100GeV. The initial conditions for recent numerical
simulations of the earliest and smallest objects to have formed in the
universe, need to be modified accordingly. The smallest dark matter clumps may
be detectable through gamma-ray production from particle annihilation, through
fluctuations in the event rate of direct detection experiments, or through
their tidal gravitational effect on wide orbits of objects near the outer edge
of the solar system.",2005-04-05T16:10:40Z
Some statistics of Galactic SNRs,"The selection effects applicable to the identification of Galactic supernova
remnants (SNRs) at radio wavelengths are discussed. Low surface brightness
remnants are missing, as are those with small angular sizes (including young
but distant SNRs). Several statistical properties of Galactic SNRs are
discussed, including the surface-brightness/diameter (Sigma-D) relation. The
wide range of intrinsic properties of Galactic remnants with known distances,
and the observational selection effects, means that the Sigma-D relation is of
limited use to derive diameters and hence distances for individual SNRs, or for
statistical studies.",2005-05-20T08:24:03Z

"Soft X-ray Transmission Spectroscopy of Warm/Hot Intergalactic Medium
  with XEUS","We discuss the detectability of Warm/Hot Intergalactic medium (WHIM) via the
absorption lines toward bright point sources with a future X-ray satellite
mission, XEUS. While we consider bright QSOs as specific examples, the
methodology can be applied to bright GRB afterglows. We create mock absorption
spectra for bright QSOs (more than 20 QSOs over the all sky) using a light-cone
output of a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation. We assume that WHIM is under
collisional and photo-ionization equilibrium. If WHIM has a constant
metallicity of $Z=0.1Z_\odot$, approximately 2 O{\sc vii} absorption line
system with $>3\sigma$ will be detected on average along a random line-of-sight
toward bright QSOs up to $z=0.3$ for 30 ksec exposure.",2005-04-27T10:49:36Z
"Super-critical Accretion Flows around Black Holes: Two-dimensional,
  Radiation-pressure-dominated Disks with Photon-trapping","The quasi-steady structure of super-critical accretion flows around a black
hole is studied based on the two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamical (2D-RHD)
simulations. The super-critical flow is composed of two parts: the disk region
and the outflow regions above and below the disk. Within the disk region the
circular motion as well as the patchy density structure are observed, which is
caused by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and probably by convection. The
mass-accretion rate decreases inward, roughly in proportion to the radius, and
the remaining part of the disk material leaves the disk to form outflow because
of strong radiation pressure force. We confirm that photon trapping plays an
important role within the disk. Thus, matter can fall onto the black hole at a
rate exceeding the Eddington rate. The emission is highly anisotropic and
moderately collimated so that the apparent luminosity can exceed the Eddington
luminosity by a factor of a few in the face-on view. The mass-accretion rate
onto the black hole increases with increase of the absorption opacity
(metalicity) of the accreting matter. This implies that the black hole tends to
grow up faster in the metal rich regions as in starburst galaxies or
star-forming regions.",2005-04-07T00:56:36Z
Dark Matter and Stellar Mass in the Luminous Regions of Disk Galaxies,"We investigate the correlations among stellar mass (M_*), disk scale length
(R_d), and rotation velocity at 2.2 disk scale lengths (V_2.2) for a sample of
81 disk-dominated galaxies (disk/total >= 0.9) selected from the SDSS. We
measure V_2.2 from long-slit H-alpha rotation curves and infer M_* from galaxy
i-band luminosities (L_i) and g-r colors. We find logarithmic slopes of
2.60+/-0.13 and 3.05+/-0.12 for the L_i-V_2.2 and M_*-V_2.2 relations, somewhat
shallower than most previous studies, with intrinsic scatter of 0.13 dex and
0.16 dex. Our direct estimates of the total-to-stellar mass ratio within
2.2R_d, assuming a Kroupa IMF, yield a median ratio of 2.4 for M_*>10^10 Msun
and 4.4 for M_*=10^9-10^10 Msun, with large scatter at a given M_* and R_d. The
typical ratio of the rotation speed predicted for the stellar disk alone to the
observed rotation speed at 2.2R_d is ~0.65. The distribution of R_d at fixed
M_* is broad, but we find no correlation between disk size and the residual
from the M_*-V_2.2 relation, implying that this relation is an approximately
edge-on view of the disk galaxy fundamental plane. Independent of the assumed
IMF, this result implies that stellar disks do not, on average, dominate the
mass within 2.2R_d. We discuss our results in the context of infall models of
disk formation in cold dark matter halos. A model with a disk-to-halo mass
ratio m_d=0.05 provides a reasonable match to the R_d-M_* distribution for spin
parameters \lambda ranging from ~0.04-0.08, and it yields a reasonable match to
the mean M_*-V_2.2 relation. A model with m_d=0.1 predicts overly strong
correlations between disk size and M_*-V_2.2 residual. Explaining the wide
range of halo-to-disk mass ratios within 2.2R_d requires significant scatter in
m_d values, with systematically lower m_d for galaxies with lower $M_*$.",2005-04-26T20:07:29Z
"The Diffuse Emission and a Variable ULX in the Elliptical Galaxy NGC
  3379","A Chandra observation of the intermediate luminosity (M_B=-20) elliptical
galaxy NGC 3379 resolves 75% of the X-ray emission within the central 5kpc into
point sources. Spectral analysis of the remaining unresolved emission within
the central 770pc indicates that 90% of the emission probably arises from
undetected point sources, while 10% arises from thermal emission from kT=0.6keV
gas. Assuming a uniform density distribution in the central region of the
galaxy gives a gas mass of 5.0e5 Mo.Such a small amount of gas can be supplied
by stellar mass loss in only 1.0e7 years. Thus, the gas must be accreting into
the central supermassive black hole at a very low radiative efficiency as in
the ADAF or RIAF models, or is being expelled in a galactic wind driven by the
same AGN feedback mechanism as that observed in cluster cooling flows. If the
gas is being expelled in an AGN driven wind, then the ratio of mechanical to
radio power of the AGN must be 1.0e4, which is comparable to that measured in
cluster cooling flows which have recently been perturbed by radio outbursts.
The brightest point source in NGC 3379 is located 360pc from the central AGN
with a peak luminosity of 3.5e39 ergs/s, which places it in the class of
ultra-luminous X-ray point sources (ULX). Analysis of an archival ROSAT HRI
observation of NGC 3379 shows that this source was at a comparable luminosity 5
years prior to the Chandra observation. During the Chandra observation, the
source intensity smoothly varies by a factor of two with the suggestion of an
8-10 hour period.",2005-06-01T13:07:05Z
"Reduction Algorithms for the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer: 6
  Months of Flight Data","The first six months of flight data from the Multiband Imaging Photometer for
Spitzer (MIPS) were used to test MIPS reduction algorithms based on extensive
preflight laboratory data and modeling. The underlying approach for the
preflight algorithms has been found to be sound, but some modifications have
improved the performance. The main changes are scan mirror dependent flat
fields at 24 micron, hand processing to remove the time dependent stim flash
latents and fast/slow response variations at 70 micron, and the use of
asteroids and other sources instead of stars for flux calibration at 160 micron
due to a blue ``leak.'' The photometric accuracy of flux measurpements is
currently 5%, 10%, and 20% at 24, 70, and 160 micron, respectively. These
numbers are expected to improve as more flight data are analyzed and data
reduction algorithms refined.",2005-02-03T20:22:49Z
"A Unified, Merger-Driven Model for the Origin of Starbursts, Quasars,
  the Cosmic X-Ray Background, Supermassive Black Holes and Galaxy Spheroids","We present an evolutionary model for starbursts, quasars, and spheroidal
galaxies in which mergers between gas-rich galaxies drive nuclear inflows of
gas, producing intense starbursts and feeding the buried growth of supermassive
black holes (BHs) until feedback expels gas and renders a briefly visible
optical quasar. The quasar lifetime and obscuring column density depend on both
the instantaneous and peak luminosity of the quasar, and we determine this
dependence using a large set of simulations of galaxy mergers varying host
galaxy properties, orbital geometry, and gas physics. We use these fits to
deconvolve observed quasar luminosity functions (LFs) and obtain the evolution
of the formation rate of quasars with a certain peak luminosity, n(L_peak,z).
Quasars spend extended periods of time at luminosities well below peak, and so
n(L_peak) has a maximum corresponding to the 'break' in the observed LF,
falling off at both brighter and fainter luminosities. From n(L_peak) and our
simulation results, we obtain self-consistent fits to hard and soft X-ray and
optical quasar LFs and predict many observables, including: column density
distributions of optical and X-ray samples, the LF of broad-line quasars in
X-ray samples and the broad-line fraction as a function of luminosity, active
BH mass functions, the distribution of Eddington ratios at z~0-2, the z=0 mass
function of relic BHs and total mass density of BHs, and the cosmic X-ray
background. In every case, our predictions agree well with observed estimates,
and unlike previous modeling attempts, we are able to reproduce them without
invoking any ad hoc assumptions about source properties or distributions. We
provide a library of Monte Carlo realizations of our models for comparison with
observations. (Abridged)",2005-06-16T20:18:57Z
FUSE Measurements of Far Ultraviolet Extinction. I. Galactic Sight Lines,"We present extinction curves that include data down to far ultraviolet
wavelengths (FUV; 1050 - 1200 A) for nine Galactic sight lines. The FUV
extinction was measured using data from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic
Explorer. The sight lines were chosen for their unusual extinction properties
in the infrared through the ultraviolet; that they probe a wide range of dust
environments is evidenced by the large spread in their measured ratios of
total-to-selective extinction, R_V = 2.43 - 3.81. We find that extrapolation of
the Fitzpatrick & Massa relationship from the ultraviolet appears to be a good
predictor of the FUV extinction behavior. We find that predictions of the FUV
extinction based upon the Cardelli, Clayton & Mathis (CCM) dependence on R_V
give mixed results. For the seven extinction curves well represented by CCM in
the infrared through ultraviolet, the FUV extinction is well predicted in three
sight lines, over-predicted in two sight lines, and under-predicted in 2 sight
lines. A Maximum Entropy Method analysis using a simple three component grain
model shows that seven of the nine sight lines in the study require a larger
fraction of grain materials to be in dust when FUV extinction is included in
the models. Most of the added grain material is in the form of small (radii <
200 A) grains.",2005-02-24T20:46:14Z
An Upper Limit on the Expansion Velocity of GRB Candidate SN 2001em,"We report on VLBI observations of the Type I b/c supernova 2001em, three
years after the explosion. It had been suggested that SN 2001em might be a
jet-driven gamma ray burst (GRB), with the jet oriented far from the line of
sight so that the GRB would not be visible from earth. To test this conjecture,
we determined the size of SN 2001em. It is only marginally resolved at our
resolution of ~0.9 mas. The 3-sigma upper limit on the major axis angular size
of the radio source was 0.59 mas (FWHM of an elliptical Gaussian),
corresponding to a one-sided apparent expansion velocity of 70,000 km/s for a
distance of 80 Mpc. No low-brightness jet was seen in our image to a level of
4% of the peak brightness. If we assume instead a spherical shell geometry
typical of a supernova, we find the angular radius of SN 2001em was 0.17
(-0.10,+0.06) mas, implying an isotropic expansion velocity of 20,000 (-12,000,
+7,000) km/s, which is comparable to the expansion velocities of supernova
shells. Our observations, therefore, are not consistent with a relativistically
expanding radio source in SN 2001em, but are instead consistent with a
supernova shell origin of SN 2001's radio emission.",2005-04-29T18:57:03Z

"A Re-brightening of the Radio Nebula associated with the 2004 December
  27 giant flare from SGR 1806--20","The 2004 Dec. 27 giant Gamma-ray flare detected from the magnetar SGR 1806-20
created an expanding radio nebula which we have monitored with the Australia
Telescope Compact Array and the Very Large Array. These data indicate that
there was an increase in the observed flux ~25 days after the initial flare
that lasted for ~8 days, which we believe is the result of ambient material
swept-up and shocked by this radio nebula. For a distance to SGR 1806-20 of 15
kpc, using the properties of this rebrightening we infer that the initial blast
wave was dominated by baryonic material of mass M>10^{24.5} g. For an initial
expansion velocity v~0.7c (as derived in an accompanying paper), we infer this
material had an initial kinetic energy E>10^{44.5} ergs. If this material
originated from the magnetar itself, it may have emitted a burst of ultra-high
energy (E > 1 TeV) neutrinos far brighter than that expected from other
astrophysical sources.",2005-03-11T17:12:16Z
"Deviation of light curves of gamma-ray burst pulses from standard forms
  due to the curvature effect of spherical fireballs or uniform jets","As revealed previously, under the assumption that some pulses of gamma-ray
bursts are produced by shocks in spherical fireballs or uniform jets of large
opening angles, there exists a standard decay form of the profile of pulses
arising from very narrow or suddenly dimming local (or intrinsic) pulses due to
the relativistic curvature effect (the Doppler effect over the spherical shell
surface). Profiles of pulses arising from other local pulses were previously
found to possess a reverse S-feature deviation from the standard decay form. We
show in this paper that, in addition to the standard decay form shown in Qin et
al. (2004), there exists a marginal decay curve associated with a local
$\delta$ function pulse with a mono-color radiation. We employ the sample of
Kocevski et al. (2003) to check this prediction and find that the phenomenon of
the reverse S-feature is common, when compared with both the standard decay
form and the marginal decay curve. We accordingly propose to take the marginal
decay curve (whose function is simple) as a criteria to check if an observed
pulse could be taken as a candidate suffered from the curvature effect. We
introduce two quantities $A_1$ and $A_2$ to describe the mentioned deviations
within and beyond the $FWHM$ position of the decay phase, respectively. The
values of $A_1$ and $A_2$ of pulses of the sample are calculated, and the
result suggests that for most of these pulses their corresponding local pulses
might contain a long decay time relative to the time scale of the curvature
effect.",2005-04-19T03:21:56Z
Multi-wavelength interferometry of evolved stars using VLTI and VLBA,"We report on our project of coordinated VLTI/VLBA observations of the
atmospheres and circumstellar environments of evolved stars. We illustrate in
general the potential of interferometric measurements to study stellar
atmospheres and envelopes, and demonstrate in particular the advantages of a
coordinated multi-wavelength approach including near/mid-infrared as well as
radio interferometry. We have so far made use of VLTI observations of the near-
and mid-infrared stellar sizes and of concurrent VLBA observations of the SiO
maser emission. To date, this project includes studies of the Mira stars S Ori
and RR Aql as well as of the supergiant AH Sco. These sources all show strong
silicate emission features in their mid-infrared spectra. In addition, they
each have relatively strong SiO maser emission. The results from our first
epochs of S Ori measurements have recently been published and the main results
are reviewed here. The S Ori maser ring is found to lie at a mean distance of
about 2 stellar radii, a result that is virtually free of the usual uncertainty
inherent in comparing observations of variable stars widely separated in time
and stellar phase. We discuss the status of our more recent S Ori, RR Aql, and
AH Sco observations, and present an outlook on the continuation of our project.",2005-05-12T09:57:21Z
"The Effect of Spiral Structure on the Stellar Velocity Distribution in
  the Solar Neighborhood","Clumps in the solar neighborhood's stellar velocity distribution could be
caused by spiral density waves. In the solar neighborhood, stellar velocities
corresponding to orbits that are nearly closed in the frame rotating with a
spiral pattern represent likely regions for stellar concentrations. Via
particle integration, we show that orbits can intersect the solar neighborhood
when they are excited by Lindblad resonances with a spiral pattern. We find
that a two-armed spiral density wave with pattern speed placing the Sun near
the 4:1 Inner Lindblad Resonance (ILR) can cause two families of nearly closed
orbits in the solar neighborhood. One family corresponds to square shaped
orbits aligned so their peaks lie on top of, and support, the two dominant
stellar arms. The second family correspond to orbits 45 degrees out of phase
with the other family. Such a spiral density pattern could account for two
major clumps in the solar neighborhood's velocity distribution. The
Pleiades/Hyades moving group corresponds to the first family of orbits and the
Coma Berenices moving group corresponds to the second family. This model
requires a spiral pattern speed of approximately 0.66 +- 0.03 times the angular
rotation rate of the Sun or 18.1 +- 0.8 km/s/kpc.",2005-02-10T20:19:05Z
"Characterizing the Adaptive Optics Off-Axis Point-Spread Function. II.
  Methods for Use in Laser Guide Star Observations","Most current astronomical adaptive optics (AO) systems rely on the
availability of a bright star to measure the distortion of the incoming
wavefront. Replacing the guide star with an artificial laser beacon alleviates
this dependency on bright stars and therefore increases sky coverage, but it
does not eliminate another serious problem for AO observations. This is the
issue of PSF variation with time and field position near the guide star. In
fact, because a natural guide star is still necessary for correction of the
low-order phase error, characterization of laser guide star (LGS) AO PSF
spatial variation is more complicated than for a natural guide star alone. We
discuss six methods for characterizing LGS AO PSF variation that can
potentially improve the determination of the PSF away from the laser spot, that
is, off-axis. Calibration images of dense star fields are used to determine the
change in PSF variation with field position. This is augmented by AO system
telemetry and simple computer simulations to determine a more accurate off-axis
PSF. We report on tests of the methods using the laser AO system on the Lick
Observatory Shane Telescope. [Abstract truncated.]",2005-05-10T18:40:28Z
Cooling Active Region Loops Observed With SXT and TRACE,"An Impulsive Heating Multiple Strand (IHMS) Model is able to reproduce the
observational characteristics of EUV (~ 1 MK) active region loops. This model
implies that some of the loops must reach temperatures where X-ray filters are
sensitive (> 2.5 MK) before they cool to EUV temperatures. Hence, some bright
EUV loops must be preceded by bright X-ray loops. Previous analysis of X-ray
and EUV active region observations, however, have concluded that EUV loops are
not preceded by X-ray loops. In this paper, we examine two active regions
observed in both X-ray and EUV filters and analyze the evolution of five loops
over several hours. These loops first appear bright in the X-ray images and
later appear bright in the EUV images. The delay between the appearance of the
loops in the X-ray and EUV filters is as little as 1 hour and as much as 3
hours. All five loops appear as single ``monolithic'' structures in the X-ray
images, but are resolved into many smaller structures in the (higher
resolution) EUV images. The positions of the loops appear to shift during
cooling implying that the magnetic field is changing as the loops evolve. There
is no correlation between the brightness of the loop in the X-ray and EUV
filters meaning a bright X-ray loop does not necessarily cool to a bright EUV
loop and vice versa. The progression of the loops from X-ray images to EUV
images and the observed substructure is qualitatively consistent with the IMHS
model.",2005-02-14T19:26:07Z
Dissipation in Pulsar Winds,"I review the constraints placed on relativistic pulsar winds by comparing

literature for achieving the low magnetisation required at the inner edge of
the Nebula, are then discussed, emphasising that of dissipation in the
striped-wind picture. The possibility of direct observation of the wind is
examined. Based on the predicted orientation of the polarisation vector, I
outline a new argument suggesting that the off-pulse component of the optical
emission of the Crab pulsar originates in the wind.",2005-04-19T12:47:45Z
"Cosmic Infrared Background: Resolved, Unresolved and Spitzer
  Contributions","The Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) peaks in the Far-Infrared (FIR), and its

facilities and Spitzer, the populations contributing to the CIB are being
characterized: the dominant galaxy contributions to the FIR CIB are Luminous IR
galaxies (LIRGs) at 0.5<z<1.5 and, to the submm CIB, Ultra-LIRGs at z>2. These
populations of galaxies experience very high rates of evolution with redshift.
Because of confusion, the CIB is (and will remain in some domains) partially

"Strong CaII absorption lines in the reddened quasar SDSS J2339$-$0912:
  Evidence of the collision/merger in the host galaxy?","We report the detection of strong CaII/MgII absorption lines at the quasar
redshift in the narrow line quasar SDSS J2339-0912 (z=0.6604). The quasar
exhibits strong FeII, small Balmer emission line width and a very red B-Ks
color. Both the optical continuum and broad emission lines are reddened by
SMC-like dust of E(B-V)~1.0 mag, while its near-infrared color (J-Ks=1.60)
shows little reddening. The CaII absorption lines are saturated and resolved
with an FWHM of 362 km/s and an equivalent width of W_{CaII K}=4.2\AA (in the
source rest frame). MgII absorption lines are also saturated and have a similar
line width. The line profile and the fact that there is no evidence for
starlight from the host galaxy suggest that these absorption lines are not of a
stellar origin. The ratio of column density of CaII to that of dust is
consistent with that of the ISM in our Galaxy. We suggest that both the heavy
reddening and the large absorption line width are due to the highly disturbed
ISM on the line of sight toward the quasar, and that the disturbance is caused
by a galaxy collision or even merger in the quasar host galaxy.",2005-04-14T10:52:32Z
"CMB maps lensed by cosmological structures: Simulations and statistical

proposed. It is based on a periodic universe covered by simulation boxes.
Photons move along appropriate directions to avoid periodicity effects. Here,
an improved version of this method is applied to simulate lensed CMB maps and
maps of lens deformations. Particle mesh n-body simulations with appropriate
boxes and resolutions are used to evolve the nonlinear inhomogeneities until
present time. The resulting maps are statistically analyzed to look for
deviations from Gaussianity. These deviations are measured --for the first
time-- using correlations for configurations of n directions (n being smaller
than 7). A wide range of angular scales are considered. Some interesting
prospects are outlined.",2005-04-20T17:13:42Z
Host Galaxies of the High-redshift AGNs in the GOODS Fields,"The star-formation rates and the stellar masses of the host galaxies of AGNs
at high-redshifts are keys to understanding the evolution of the relation
between the mass of the spheroidal component of a galaxy and the mass of its
central black hole. We investigate the host galaxies of 31 AGNs with
spectroscopic redshifts between 2 and 4 found in the deep Chandra surveys of
the GOODS fields with the ACS images. The sample can be divided into 17
``extended'' AGNs and 14 ``compact'' AGNs based on the concentration parameter
defined as the difference between the aperture magnitudes with 0.07"" and 0.25""
diameter. We derive upper limits of the UV luminosities of the host galaxies of
the ``compact'' AGN sample, and upper and lower limits of the UV luminosities
of the host galaxies of the ``extended'' AGN sample.These limits are consistent
with the knee of the luminosity function of the Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at
z=3, suggesting moderate star-formation rates, less than 40 Msolar/yr, in the
host galaxies of the AGNs at 2<z_sp<4 without correcting the dust extinction.
By combining the limits of the UV luminosities with the observed K-band
magnitudes for the ``extended'' AGNs, we derive the upper and lower limits of
the stellar masses of their host galaxies. The derived upper limits on the
stellar masses range from 10^10 Msolar to 10^12 Msolar. The upper limits imply
that the Mbulge-MBH relation of the high-redshift AGNs is different from that
of the galaxies in the nearby universe or the average Eddington ratio of the
high-redshift AGNs is higher than that of low-redshift AGNs with
lower-luminosity.",2005-05-16T07:13:07Z
A Radio Monitoring Survey of Ultra-Luminous X-Ray Sources,"We present the results of a radio monitoring campaign to search for radio
emission from nearby ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). These sources are
bright off-nuclear X-ray point sources with luminosities exceeding L_X > 10^39
erg/sec. A well-defined sample of the 9 nearest ULXs has been monitored eight
times during 5 months with the Very Large Array in A and B configuration. Our
limiting sensitivity is approximately 0.15 mJy (4 sigma) for radio flares and
around 60 uJy for continuous emission. In M82 two ULXs seem to have coincident
compact radio sources, which are probably supernova remnants. No continuous or
flaring radio emission has been detected from any other ULX. Thus, ULXs do not
generally emit steady-state radio emission above radio powers of 1.5 10^17
W/Hz. The non-detections of the continuous emission are consistent with beamed
or unbeamed radio emission from accreting black holes of <= 10^3 Msol based on
the radio/X-ray correlation. Other published radio detections (M82, NGC 5408)
are also discussed in this context. Both detections are significantly above our
detection limit. If ULXs have flaring radio emission above 4 10^17 W/Hz we can
give an upper limit on the duty circle of the flares of 6%. This upper limit is
in agreement with the observed number of flares in Galactic radio transients.
Additionally we present a yet unreported radio double structure in the nearby
low-luminosity AGN NGC 4736.",2005-02-14T16:07:51Z
"Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS Imaging of W3 IRS 5: A Trapezium in the
  Making?","We present Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS imaging of W3 IRS 5, a binary
high-mass protostar. In addition to the two protostars, NICMOS images taken in
the F222M and F160W filters show three new 2.22 micron sources with very red
colors; these sources fall within a region 5600 AU in diameter, and are
coincident with a 100 solar mass dense molecular clump. Two additional point
sources are found within 0.4'' (800 AU) of one of the high-mass protostars;
these may be stellar companions or unresolved emission knots from an outflow.
We propose that these sources constitute a nascent Trapezium system in the
center of the W3 IRS 5 cluster containing as many as five proto OB stars. This
would be the first identification of a Trapezium still deeply embedded in its
natal gas.",2005-02-17T19:12:48Z
Mass Flows in Cometary UCHII Regions,"High spectral and spatial resolution, mid-infrared fine structure line
observations toward two ultracompact HII (UCHII) regions (G29.96 -0.02 and Mon
R2) allow us to study the structure and kinematics of cometary UCHII regions.
In our earlier study of Mon R2, we showed that highly organized mass motions
accounted for most of the velocity structure in that UCHII region. In this
work, we show that the kinematics in both Mon R2 and G29.96 are consistent with
motion along an approximately paraboloidal shell. We model the velocity
structure seen in our mapping data and test the stellar wind bow shock model
for such paraboloidal like flows. The observations and the simulation indicate
that the ram pressures of the stellar wind and ambient interstellar medium
cause the accumulated mass in the bow shock to flow along the surface of the
shock. A relaxation code reproduces the mass flow's velocity structure as
derived by the analytical solution. It further predicts that the pressure
gradient along the flow can accelerate ionized gas to a speed higher than that
of the moving star. In the original bow shock model, the star speed relative to
the ambient medium was considered to be the exit speed of ionized gas in the
shell.",2005-06-06T16:29:05Z
"Early GRB Optical and Infrared Afterglow Observations with the 2-m
  Robotic Liverpool Telescope","We present the first optical observations of a Gamma Ray Burst (GRB)
afterglow using the 2-m robotic Liverpool Telescope (LT), which is owned and
operated by Liverpool John Moores University and situated on La Palma. We
briefly discuss the capabilities of LT and its suitability for rapid follow-up
observations of early optical and infrared GRB light curves. In particular, the
combination of aperture, site, instrumentation and rapid response (robotic
over-ride mode aided by telescope's rapid slew and fully-opening enclosure)
makes the LT ideal for investigating the nature of short bursts, optically-dark
bursts, and GRB blast-wave physics in general. We briefly describe the LT's key
position in the RoboNet-1.0 network of robotic telescopes. We present the LT
observations of GRB041006 and use its gamma-ray properties to predict the time
of the break in optical light curve, a prediction consistent with the
observations.",2005-02-24T13:25:50Z
"High Angular Resolution Observations of the Collimated Jet Source
  Associated with a Massive Protostar in IRAS 16547-4247","A triple radio source recently detected in association with the luminous
infrared source IRAS 16547-4247 has been studied with high angular resolution
and high sensitivity with the Very Large Array at 3.6 and 2 cm. Our
observations confirm the interpretation that the central object is a thermal
radio jet, while the two outer lobes are most probably heavily obscured HH
objects. The thermal radio jet is resolved angularly for the first time and
found to align closely with the outer lobes. The opening angle of the thermal
jet is estimated to be $\sim 25^\circ$, confirming that collimated outflows can
also be present in massive protostars. The proper motions of the outer lobes
should be measurable over timescales of a few years. Several fainter sources
detected in the region are most probably associated with other stars in a young
cluster.",2005-03-16T00:15:21Z
"Early-Time Chromatic Variations in the Wind-Swept Medium of GRB 021211
  and the Faintness of its Afterglow","We present Follow-Up Network for Gamma-Ray Bursts (FUN GRB) Collaboration
observations of the optical afterglow of GRB 021211 made between 143 seconds
and 102 days after the burst. Our unique data set includes the earliest
filtered detections and color information for an afterglow in the pre-Swift
era. We find that the afterglow is best described by (1) propagation through a
wind-swept medium, (2) a cooling break that is blueward of the observed optical
frequencies, and (3) a hard electron energy distribution. However, superimposed
on this ""standard model"" behavior we find significant chromatic variations
within the first few hours after the burst. We consider possible reasons for
these variations, including the possibility that they are due to a dust echo.
Finally, we constrain physical parameters that describe the afterglow and
surrounding medium for a variety of scenarios and find that GRB 021211's
afterglow is faint for a combination of 3-4 reasons: (1) a low fraction of
energy in relativistic electrons, (2) a low density for the wind-swept medium,
implying either a low mass-loss rate and/or a high wind velocity for the
progenitor, (3) a wide opening/viewing angle for the jet, and possibly (4)
moderate source frame extinction. The jet appears to be significantly far from
equipartition and magnetically dominated. More extreme versions of this might
explain the darkness of many afterglows in the Swift era.",2005-05-23T18:03:44Z
"Third-order perturbative solutions in the Lagrangian perturbation theory
  with pressure II: Effect of the transverse modes","Lagrangian perturbation theory for cosmological fluid describes structure
formation in the quasi-nonlinear stage well. In a previous paper, we presented
a third-order perturbative equation for Lagrangian perturbation with pressure.
There we considered only the longitudinal modes for the first-order
perturbation. In this paper, we generalize the perturbation, i.e., we consider
both the longitudinal and the transverse modes for the first-order
perturbation. Then we derive third-order perturbative equations and solutions.",2005-04-18T06:29:21Z
"The binary period and outburst behaviour of the SMC X-ray binary pulsar
  system SXP504","A probable binary period has been detected in the optical counterpart to the
X-ray source CXOU J005455.6-724510 = RX J0054.9-7245 = AXJ0054.8-7244 = SXP504
in the Small Magellanic Cloud. This source was detected by Chandra on 04 Jul
2002 and subsequently observed by XMM-Newton on 18 Dec 2003. The source is
coincident with an Optical Gravitational Lensing (OGLE) object in the
lightcurves of which several optical outburst peaks are visible at ~ 268 day
intervals. Timing analysis shows a period of 268.6 +/- 0.1 days at > 99%
significance. Archival Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) data for the 504s
pulse-period has revealed detections which correspond closely with predicted or
actual peaks in the optical data. The relationship between this orbital period
and the pulse period of 504s is within the normal variance found in the Corbet
diagram.",2005-05-17T17:27:27Z
"Energy input from quasars regulates the growth and activity of black
  holes and their host galaxies","In the early Universe, while galaxies were still forming, black holes as
massive as a billion solar masses powered quasars. Supermassive black holes are
found at the centers of most galaxies today, where their masses are related to
the velocity dispersions of stars in their host galaxies and hence to the mass
of the central bulge of the galaxy. This suggests a link between the growth of
the black holes and the host galaxies, which has indeed been assumed for a
number of years. But the origin of the observed relation between black hole
mass and stellar velocity dispersion, and its connection with the evolution of
galaxies have remained unclear. Here we report simulations that simultaneously
follow star formation and the growth of black holes during galaxy-galaxy
collisions. We find that in addition to generating a burst of star formation, a
merger leads to strong inflows that feed gas to the supermassive black hole and
thereby power the quasar. The energy released by the quasar expels enough gas
to quench both star formation and further black hole growth. This determines
the lifetime of the quasar phase (approaching 100 million years) and explains
the relationship between the black hole mass and the stellar velocity
dispersion.",2005-02-09T18:45:56Z
Super-solar Metallicity in the NLS1 Galaxy Markarian 1044,"The determination of the bulk metallicity and the abundance mixture of
various elements is very difficult in quasars and AGNs because only a few lines
are observed and the ionization correction is unknown. Most abundance studies
of AGNs assume the N/C ratio scales as metallicity (nitrogen goes as
metallicity squared) and so serves as a metallicity indicator. We present an
accurate metallicity determination of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy
Markarian 1044, using O VI column density measurements from the Far Ultraviolet
Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) together with C IV, N V, and H I from Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) observations. In this absorption line study we find that
the circumnuclear gas in Mrk 1044 has a metallicity of at least five times
solar. This is consistent with the expectation that NLS1s have a high
metallicity, similar to that found in high-redshift quasars. More surprisingly,
we find that the absorbing material requires a near-solar mixture. In other
words, the N/C is consistent with the solar ratio, and does not scale with the
metallicity. This suggests that the chemical enrichment scenario for this
object, and perhaps for AGNs in general, may be different from the traditional
model of galactic metal enrichment, at least in the high-metallicity regime.",2005-04-06T20:00:02Z
"Berkeley 22, an old and distant open cluster towards the Galactic
  anticentre","We present deep CCD BVI photometry of the distant, old open cluster Berkeley
22, covering from the red giants branch (RGB) to about 6 magnitudes below the
main sequence (MS) turn-off. Using the synthetic Colour - Magnitude Diagram
method with three different types of stellar evolutionary tracks, we estimate
values and theoretical uncertainty of distance modulus mod0, reddening E(B-V),
age tau and approximate metallicity. The best fit to the data is obtained for
13.8 <= mod0 <= 14.1, 0.64 <= E(B-V) <= 0.65, 2 <= tau <= 2.5 Gyr (depending on
the amount of overshooting from convective regions adopted in the stellar
models) and solar metallicity.",2005-02-24T14:30:32Z
"The 2dF QSO Redshift Survey - XV. Correlation analysis of redshift-Space
  distortions","We analyse the redshift-space (z-space) distortions of QSO clustering in the
2dF QSO Redshift Survey (2QZ). To interpret the z-space correlation function,
xi(sigma,pi), we require an accurate model for the QSO real-space correlation
function, xi(r). Although a single power-law xi(r) model fits the projected
correlation function (wp(sigma)) at small scales, it implies somewhat too
shallow a slope for both wp(sigma) and the z-space correlation function, xi(s),
at larger scales > 20 h^(-1) Mpc. Motivated by the form for xi(r) seen in the
2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) and in standard LCDM predictions, we use a
double power-law model for xi(r) which gives a good fit to xi(s) and wp(sigma).
The model is parametrized by a slope of gamma=1.45 for 1<r<10 h^(-1) Mpc and
gamma=2.30 for 10<r<40 h^(-1) Mpc. As found for 2dFGRS, the value of beta
determined from the ratio of xi(s)/xi(r) depends sensitively on the form of
xi(r) assumed. With our double power-law form for xi(r), we measure
beta(z=1.4)=0.32(+0.09)(-0.11). Assuming the same model for xi(r) we then
analyse the z-space distortions in the 2QZ xi(sigma,pi) and put constraints on
the values of Omega m and beta(z=1.4), using an improved version of the method
of Hoyle et al. The constraints we derive are Omega m=0.35(+0.19)(-0.13),
beta(z=1.4)=0.50(+0.13)(-0.15), in agreement with our xi(s)/\xi(r) results at
the ~1 sigma level.",2005-04-20T12:43:22Z
"Multiband Optical Photometry and Bolometric Light Curve of the Type Ia

supernova SN 2004S, which appeared in the galaxy MCG-05-16-021, obtained during
2004 February 12 to March 22. Multiband and bolometric light curves constructed
using our data as well as other available data are presented. The time of B
band maximum and the peak magnitudes in different bands are obtained using the
fits of light curve and colour templates. We clearly see a strong shoulder in
$\rm R_{c}$ band and a second maximum in $\rm I_{c}$ band. SN 2004S closely
resembles SN 1992al after maximum. From the peak bolometric luminosity we
estimate the ejected mass of $\rm ^{\rm 56}Ni$ to be 0.41 $\rm M_{\odot}$.",2005-04-07T16:50:42Z
"XMM-Newton View of PKS 2155-304: Characterizing the X-ray Variability
  Properties with EPIC-PN","Starting from XMM-Newton EPIC-PN data, we present the X-ray variability
characteristics of PKS 2155-304 using a simple analysis of the excess variance,
\xs, and of the fractional rms variability amplitude, fvar. The scatter in \xs\
and \fvar, calculated using 500 s long segments of the light curves, is smaller
than the scatter expected for red noise variability. This alone does not imply
that the underlying process responsible for the variability of the source is
stationary, since the real changes of the individual variance estimates are
possibly smaller than the large scatters expected for a red noise process. In
fact the averaged \xs and \fvar, reducing the fluctuations of the individual
variances, chang e with time, indicating non-stationary variability. Moreover,
both the averaged \sqxs (absolute rms variability amplitude) and \fvar show
linear correlation with source flux but in an opposite sense: \sqxs correlates
with flux, but \fvar anti-correlates with flux. These correlations suggest that
the variability process of the source is strongly non-stationary as random
scatters of variances should not yield any correlation. \fvar spectra were
constructed to compare variability amplitudes in different energy bands. We
found that the fractional rms variability amplitude of the source, when
significant variability is observed, increases logarithmically with the photon
energy, indicating significant spectral variability. The point-to-point
variability amplitude may also track this trend, suggesting that the slopes of
the power spectral density of the source are energy-independent. Using the
normalized excess variance the black hole mass of \pks was estimated to be
about $1.45 \times 10^8 M_{\bigodot}$. This is compared and contrasted with the
estimates derived from measurements of the host galaxies.",2005-05-09T03:31:47Z
"Self-Sustained Ionization and Vanishing Dead Zones in Protoplanetary
  Disks","We analyze the ionization state of the magnetohydrodynamically turbulent
protoplanetary disks and propose a new mechanism of sustaining ionization.
First, we show that in the quasi-steady state of turbulence driven by
magnetorotational instability in a typical protoplanetary disk with dust
grains, the amount of energy dissipation should be sufficient for providing the
ionization energy that is required for activating magnetorotational
instability. Second, we show that in the disk with dust grains the energetic
electrons that compose electric currents in weakly ionized gas can provide
collisional ionization, depending on the actual saturation state of
magnetorotational turbulence. On the other hand, we show that in the
protoplanetary disks with the reduced effect of dust grains, the turbulent
motion can homogenize the ionization degree, leading to the activation of
magnetorotational instability even in the absence of other ionization
processes. The results in this Letter indicate that most of the regions in
protoplanetary disks remain magnetically active, and we thus require a change
in the theoretical modeling of planet formation.",2005-06-07T03:49:45Z
The Birth of High Mass Stars: Accretion and/or Mergers?,"The observational consequences of the merger scenario for massive star
formation are explored and contrasted with the gradual accumulation of mass by
accretion. Protostellar mergers may produce high luminosity infrared flares
lasting years to centuries followed by a luminosity decline on the
Kelvin-Helmholtz time-scale of the merger product. Mergers may be surrounded by
thick tori of expanding debris, impulsive wide-angle outflows, and shock
induced maser and radio continuum emission. Collision products are expected to
have fast stellar rotation and a large multiplicity fraction. Close encounters
or mergers will produce circumstellar debris disks with an orientation that
differs form that of a pre-existing disk. The extremely rare merger of two
stars close to the upper-mass end of the IMF may be a possible pathway to
hypernova generated gamma-ray bursters. While accretional growth can lead to
the formation of massive stars in isolation or in loose clusters, mergers can
only occur in high-density cluster environments. It is proposed that the
outflow emerging from the OMC1 core in the Orion molecular cloud was produced
by a protostellar merger that released between $10^{48}$ to $10^{49}$ ergs less
than a thousand years ago.",2005-02-23T17:24:46Z
"Diffuse light in z~0.25 galaxy clusters: constraining tidal damage and
  the faint end of the Luminosity Function","The starlight coming from the intergalactic space in galaxy clusters and
groups witnesses the violent tidal interactions that galaxies experience in
these dense environments. Such interactions may be (at least partly)
responsible for the transformation of normal star-forming galaxies into passive
dwarf ellipticals (dEs). In this contribution we present the first systematic
study of the IntraCluster Light (ICL) for a statistically representative sample
(Zibetti et al. 2005), which comprises 683 clusters selected between z=0.2 and
0.3 from ~1500 deg^2 in the SDSS. Their ICL is studied by stacking the images
in the g-, r-, and i-band after masking out all galaxies and polluting sources.
In this way a very uniform background illumination is obtained, that allows us
to measure surface brightnesses as faint as 31 mag/arcsec^2 and to trace the
ICL out to 700 kpc from the central galaxy. We find that the local fraction of
light contributed by intracluster stars rapidly decreases as a function of the
clustercentric distance, from ~40% at 100 kpc to ~5% at 500 kpc. By comparing
the distribution and colours of the ICL and of the clusters galaxies, we find
indication that the main source of ICL are the stars stripped from galaxies
that plunge deeply into the cluster potential well along radial orbits. Thus,
if dEs are the remnants of these stripped progenitors we should expect similar
radial orbital anisotropies and correlations between the dE luminosity function
and the amount of ICL in different clusters. The diffuse emission we measure is
contaminated by faint unresolved galaxies: this makes our flux estimate depend
to some extent on the assumed luminosity function, but, on the other hand,
allows us to constrain the number of faint galaxies. Our present results
disfavour steep (alpha<-1.35) faint-end powerlaw slopes.",2005-04-21T07:47:42Z
Total and Jet Blandford-Znajek Power in Presence of Accretion Disk,"A rotating black hole probably powers ultrarelativistic jets in gamma-ray
bursts, relativistic jets from some active galactic nuclei, and jets from some
black hole x-ray binaries. Prior estimates of the power output of a black hole
have assumed an infinitely thin disk, a magnetic field based upon a slowly
rotating black hole, and have not self-consistently determined the geometry or
magnitude of the magnetic field for a realistic accretion disk. We provide
useful formulae for the total and jet Blandford-Znajek (BZ) power and
efficiency as determined self-consistently from general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic numerical models. Of all jet mechanisms, we suggest that
only the BZ mechanism is able to produce an ultrarelativistic jet.",2005-06-16T17:53:25Z
Number counts in homogeneous and inhomogeneous dark energy models,"In the simple case of a constant equation of state, redshift distribution of
collapsed structures may constrain dark energy models. Different dark energy
models having the same energy density today but different equations of state
give quite different number counts. Moreover, we show that introducing the
possibility that dark energy collapses with dark matter (``inhomogeneous'' dark
energy) significantly complicates the picture. We illustrate our results by
comparing four dark energy models to the standard $\Lambda$-model. We
investigate a model with a constant equation of state equal to -0.8, a phantom
energy model and two scalar potentials (built out of a combination of two
exponential terms). Although their equations of state at present are almost
indistinguishable from a $\Lambda$-model, both scalar potentials undergo quite
different evolutions at higher redshifts and give different number counts. We
show that phantom dark energy induces opposite departures from the
$\Lambda$-model as compared with the other models considered here. Finally, we
find that inhomogeneous dark energy enhances departures from the
$\Lambda$-model with maximum deviations of about 15% for both number counts and
integrated number counts. Larger departures from the $\Lambda$-model are
obtained for massive structures which are rare objects making it difficult to
statistically distinguish between models.",2005-06-02T02:46:20Z
Abundance Anomalies in NGC6752 - Do AGB Stars Have a Role?,"We are in the process of testing a popular theory that the observed abundance
anomalies in the Globular Cluster NGC 6752 are due to `internal pollution' from
intermediate mass asymptotic giant branch stars. To this end we are using a
chemical evolution model incorporating custom-made stellar evolution yields
calculated using a detailed stellar evolution code. By tracing the chemical
evolution of the intracluster gas, which is polluted by two generations of
stars, we are able to test the internal pollution scenario in which the Na- and
Al-enhanced ejecta from intermediate mass stars is either accreted onto the
surfaces of other stars, or goes toward forming new stars.
  In this paper we focus mainly on the nucleosynthetic yields of the AGB stars
and discuss whether these stars are the source of the observed Na-O
anticorrelation. Comparing our preliminary results with observational data
suggests that the qualitative theory is not supported by this quantitative
study.",2005-05-18T14:05:13Z
"VLTI/MIDI measurements of extended mid-infrared emission in the Galactic

(IRS 1W, IRS 10W, IRS 2, IRS 8) in immediate vicinity to the black hole (BH) at
the GC. We derive 3$\sigma$ upper limits of the correlated fluxes of our target
sources which give direct constraints on the size of the emitting regions. Most
probably the emission originates from bow shocks generated by windy stars
ploughing through the dense matter of the Northern MiniSpiral.",2005-05-25T14:30:46Z
Neutrino Processes in Strong Magnetic Fields,"The processes of electron neutrino capture on neutron and electron
anti-neutrino capture on proton, and their reverse processes provide the
dominant mechanisms for heating and cooling the material below the stalled
shock in a core-collapse supernova. We summarize the major effects of strong
magnetic fields on the rates of the above reactions and illustrate these
effects with a simple supernova model. Due to parity violation of weak
interaction the heating rates are asymmetric even for a uniform magnetic field.
The cooling rates are also asymmetric for nonuniform fields. The most dramatic
effect of strong magnetic fields of 10^16 G is suppression of the cooling rates
by changing the equations of state through the phase space of electrons and
positrons.",2005-06-07T00:31:58Z
"On the deficit of calculated muon flux at sea level for energies $>100$
  GeV","In this paper we discuss the problem, why the use of the direct data on
primary nuclei spectra together with the modern hadronic interaction models
leads to significant deficit of computed vertical muon flux at sea level for
energies $>100$ GeV. We suggest, that to find out the source of this
inconsistency it is necessary to perform an analysis of sensitivity of emulsion
chamber data to variations of hadron-nucleus interaction characteristics. Such
analysis will give more ground for discussion of adequacy of the up-to-date
interaction models and of mutual compatibility of primary nuclei spectra,
obtained in direct and EAS experiments.",2005-03-04T03:56:35Z
"Difficulty of detecting minihalos via $γ$-rays from dark matter
  annihilation","Analytical calculations and recent numerical experiments have shown that a
sizable of the mass in our Galaxy is in a form of clumpy, virialized
substructures that, according to \cite{dms:05}, can be as light as $10^{-6}
\msun$. In this work we estimate the gamma-rays flux expected from dark matter
annihilation occurring within these minihalos, under the hypothesis that the
bulk of dark matter is composed by neutralinos. We generate mock sky maps
showing the angular distribution of the expected gamma-ray signal. We compare
them with the sensitivities of satellite-borne experiments such as GLAST and
find that a possible detection of minihalos is indeed very challenging.",2005-05-17T19:36:00Z
Primordial non-gaussianities in single field inflation,"We calculate the three-point function for primordial scalar fluctuations in a
single field inflationary scenario where the scalar field Lagrangian is a
completely general function of the field and its first derivative. We obtain an
explicit expression for the three-point correlation function in a
self-consistent approximation scheme where the expansion rate varies slowly,
analogous to the slow-roll limit in standard, single-field inflation. The
three-point function can be written in terms of the familiar slow-roll
parameters and three new parameters which measure the non-trivial kinetic
structure of the scalar field, the departure of the sound speed from the speed
of light, and the rate of change of the sound speed.",2005-03-31T12:17:43Z
"Complementary constraints on non-standard cosmological models from CMB
  and BBN","We study metric-affine gravity (MAG) inspired cosmological models. Those
models were statistically estimated using the SNIa data. We also use the cosmic
microwave background observations and the big-bang nucleosynthesis analysis to
constrain the density parameter $\Omega_{\psi,0}$ which is related to the
non-Riemannian structure of the underlying spacetime. We argue that while the
models are statistically admissible from the SNIa analysis, complementary
stricter limits obtained from the CMB and BBN indicate that the models with
density parameters with a $a^{-6}$ scaling behaviour are virtually ruled out.
If we assume the validity of the particular MAG based cosmological model
throughout all stages of the Universe, the parameter estimates from the CMB and
BBN put a stronger limit, in comparison to the SNIa data, on the presence of
non-Riemannian structures at low redshifts.",2005-02-21T14:09:58Z
"Generalised 3D-reconstruction method of a dipole anisotropy in

directions. It generalises the full-sky coverage method of Sommers (2001) to
partial-sky coverage experiments. When the angular distribution consists of a
dipolar modulation of an otherwise isotropic flux, the method allows one to
reconstruct the dipole amplitude and the dipole orientation in 3D space. We
analyse in detail the statistical properties of the method, introducing the
concept of reconstruction power, and show that it is generally more powerful
than the standard Rayleigh analysis in right ascension. We clarify the link
between the traditionally-used first harmonic amplitude and the true, physical
dipole amplitude, and we investigate the variation of the reconstruction powers
as a function of the dipole orientation. We illustrate the method by computing
the amplitude and angular reconstruction powers of the Pierre Auger
Observatory, with the Southern site alone and with both Southern and Northern
sites. In this particular case, we find that the building of a similar site in
the Northern hemisphere would decrease the time needed for the method to reveal
a significant departure from an isotropic cosmic-ray distribution by a factor
of about eight.",2005-04-26T16:24:18Z
Neutrinos: the Key to UHE Cosmic Rays,"Observations of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECR) do not uniquely
determine both the injection spectrum and the evolution model for UHECR sources
- primarily because interactions during propagation obscure the early Universe
from direct observation. Detection of neutrinos produced in those same
interactions, coupled with UHECR results, would provide a full description of
UHECR source properties.",2005-02-11T21:56:10Z
"Asteroseismology of the planet-hosting star $μ$ Arae. I. The acoustic
  spectrum","We present HARPS spectroscopy of mu Arae (HD160691) performed for studying
the origin of the metallicity excess in this planet-hosting stars. The
asteroseismologic campaign led to the previously reported discovery of a 14
earth mass planetary companion (Santos et al. 2004). The present analysis
reinforces this interpretation by excluding other possible processes for
explaining the observed Doppler variation and leads to the identification of up
to 43 p-mode oscillations with l=0-3, frequencies in the range 1.3-2.5 mHz and
amplitudes in the range 10-40 cm/s.",2005-04-02T07:47:20Z
On the dynamics of the satellite galaxies in NGC 5044,"The NGC 5044 galaxy group is dominated by a luminous elliptical galaxy which
is surrounded by ~160 dwarf satellites. The projected number density profile of
this dwarf population deviates within ~1/3 of the virial radius from a
projected NFW-profile, which is assumed to approximate the underlying total
matter distribution. By means of a semi-analytic model we demonstrate that the
interplay between gravitation, dynamical friction and tidal mass loss and
destruction can explain the observed number density profile. We use only two
parameters in our models: the total to stellar mass fraction of the satellite
halos and the disruption efficiency. The disruption efficiency is expressed by
a minimum radius. If the tidal radius of the galaxy (halo) falls below this
radius the galaxies is assumed to become unobservable. The preferred parameters
are an initial total to stellar mass fraction of ~20 and a disruption radius of
4 kpc. In that model about 20% of all the satellites are totally disrupted on
their orbits within the group environment. Dynamical friction is less important
in shaping the inner slope of the number density profile since the reduction in
mass by tidal forces lowers the impact of the friction term. The main
destruction mechanism is tide. In the preferred model the total B-band
luminosity of all the disrupted galaxies is about twice the observed luminosity
of the central elliptical galaxy, indicating that a significant fraction of
stars are scattered into the intragroup medium.(Abridged)",2005-03-23T21:15:08Z
"The Sun as a MHD generator: application of a new heating mechanism for
  the coronal loops and closed magnetic structures","We investigate a possibility of heating of the loops and other closed
magnetic structures in active regions of the solar corona by the flow of solar
wind (plus other flows that may be present) across the magnetic field lines
(that are perpendicular to the flow), in a similar manner as a conventional MHD
generator works. A simple model is formulated which allows to calculate the
typical currents generated by this mechanism. This enables to make a judgement
whether the loops in solar active regions can be heated by the proposed
mechanism through the associated Ohmic dissipation. It is shown that even if
the heating region width is of the order of a few proton Larmor radii (this
effectively means that a loop is represented by {\it nano-threads}, by analogy
with the nano-flare coronal heating mechanism, with width of a few proton
Larmor radii) and the plasma flow speed is 50 km s$^{-1}$ then only about 1% of
the heating requirement of coronal loops could be met under this conjecture.
Other implications of the model, such as a predicted spatial heat distribution
along the loop as well as application of the model to the other places e.g.
chromosphere and corotating interaction region structures in the solar wind are
discussed.",2005-03-31T15:36:30Z
Is the island universe model consistent with observations?,"We study the island universe model, in which initially the universe is in a
cosmological constant sea, then the local quantum fluctuations violating the
null energy condition create the islands of matter, some of which might
corresponds to our observable universe. We examine the possibility that the
island universe model is regarded as an alternative scenario of the origin of
observable universe.",2005-06-03T07:15:06Z
"Effects of black hole's gravitational field on the luminosity of a star
  during close encounter","To complement hydrodynamic studies of the tidal disruption of the star by a
massive black hole, we present the study of stellar luminosity and its
variations, produced by the strong gravitational field of the black hole during
a close encounter. By simulating the relativistically moving star and its
emitted light and taking into account general relativistic effects on particle
and light trajectories, our results show that the black hole's gravity alone
induces apparent stellar luminosity variations on typical timescales of a few
r_g/c (=5 sec m_bh/10^6 M_\odot) to a few 100 r_g/c (\sim 10 min m_bh/10^6
M_\odot), where r_g=Gm_bh/c^2. We discern different cases with respect to the
strength of tidal interaction and focus on two: a) a star encountering a giant
black hole traces space-time almost as a point particle, so that the apparent
luminosity variations are dominated by clearly recognizable general
relativistic effects and b) in a close encounter of a star with a black hole of
similar size the stellar debris is spread about the black hole by processes
where hydrodynamics plays an important role. We discuss limitations and results
of our approach.",2005-02-24T13:44:49Z
RAM: A Relativistic Adaptive Mesh Refinement Hydrodynamics Code,"We have developed a new computer code, RAM, to solve the conservative
equations of special relativistic hydrodynamics (SRHD) using adaptive mesh
refinement (AMR) on parallel computers. We have implemented a
characteristic-wise, finite difference, weighted essentially non-oscillatory
(WENO) scheme using the full characteristic decomposition of the SRHD equations
to achieve fifth-order accuracy in space. For time integration we use the
method of lines with a third-order total variation diminishing (TVD)
Runge-Kutta scheme. We have also implemented fourth and fifth order Runge-Kutta
time integration schemes for comparison. The implementation of AMR and
parallelization is based on the FLASH code. RAM is modular and includes the
capability to easily swap hydrodynamics solvers, reconstruction methods and
physics modules. In addition to WENO we have implemented a finite volume module
with the piecewise parabolic method (PPM) for reconstruction and the modified
Marquina approximate Riemann solver to work with TVD Runge-Kutta time
integration. We examine the difficulty of accurately simulating shear flows in
numerical relativistic hydrodynamics codes. We show that under-resolved
simulations of simple test problems with transverse velocity components produce
incorrect results and demonstrate the ability of RAM to correctly solve these
problems. RAM has been tested in one, two and three dimensions and in
Cartesian, cylindrical and spherical coordinates. We have demonstrated
fifth-order accuracy for WENO in one and two dimensions and performed detailed
comparison with other schemes for which we show significantly lower convergence
rates. Extensive testing is presented demonstrating the ability of RAM to
address challenging open questions in relativistic astrophysics.",2005-05-23T20:36:49Z
"NOAO Fundamental Plane Survey -- II. Age and Metallicity along the Red
  Sequence","We present spectroscopic linestrength data for 4097 red-sequence galaxies in
93 low-redshift galaxy clusters, and use these to investigate variations in
average stellar populations as a function of galaxy mass. Our analysis includes
an improved treatment of nebular emission contamination, which affects ~10% of
the sample galaxies. Using the stellar population models of D. Thomas and
collaborators, we simultaneously fit twelve observed linestrength-sigma
relations in terms of common underlying trends of age, [Z/H] (total
metallicity) and a/Fe (alpha-element enhancement). We find that the observed
linestrength-sigma relations can be explained only if higher-mass red-sequence
galaxies are, on average, older, more metal rich, and more alpha-enhanced than
lower-mass galaxies. Quantitatively, the scaling relations are
age=sigma^(0.59+/-0.13), Z/H=sigma^(0.53+/-0.08) and a/Fe=sigma^(0.31+/-0.06),
where the errors reflect the range obtained using different subsets of indices.
We conclude that although the stars in giant red galaxies in clusters formed
early, most of the galaxies at the faint end joined the red sequence only at
recent epochs. This ""down-sizing"" trend is in good qualitative agreement with
observations of the red sequence at higher redshifts, but is not predicted by
semi-analytic models of galaxy formation.",2005-05-13T20:26:53Z
"Phenomenological Analogies in TeV Blazars and Black Hole X-ray Binaries
  in low state","Blazars are well known for the violent variability from the radio to
gamma-ray wavelengths. In this paper, we present a brief summary of the X-ray
variability recently obtained for TeV blazars. We also point out the probable
similarities of the X-ray variability characteristics between blazars and
microblazars. Such phenomenological analogies could be interpreted and unified
with the synchrotron X-ray emissions from the jets of the two classes of
objects that differ in black hole mass by factors of $\ga 10^7$. The
phenomenological analogies in blazars and microblazars (both are jet-dominated)
might be parallel to those in black hole X-ray binaries in high/soft state and
Seyfert galaxies (both are disk-dominated).",2005-05-09T02:42:37Z
The Globular Cluster Content of Maffei 1,"Near-infrared images have been used to search for bright globular clusters
near the center of the elliptical galaxy Maffei 1. The number of objects in
various radial intervals from the center of Maffei 1 are compared with the
number density of sources in two control fields, and we find an excess of 31
+/- 11 objects with K between 16.6 and 18.0 in an annulus between 20 and 90
arcsec from the galaxy center. At radii in excess of 90 arcsec the ability to
find clusters is frustrated by statistical noise in the foreground star
population. It is demonstrated that the globular clusters located within 90
arcsec of the center of Maffei 1 span a range of near-infrared colors that are
at least as great as that which is seen among M31 clusters; some of the
clusters appear to have colors that are consistent with them being very young.
The specific globular cluster frequency within 90 arcsec of the center of
Maffei 1 is S_N = 1.3 +/- 0.6 if the distance modulus is 28.1 +/- 0.2 and A_V =
4.7 +/- 0.2. The specific cluster frequency of Maffei 1 is thus similar to that
of other nearby field elliptical galaxies.",2005-04-14T22:32:30Z

Unifying XRFs and GRBs with a Fisher-Shaped Universal Jet Model,"We show analytically that GRB jets with an emissivity profile given by the
Fisher distribution, epsilon(theta) = A * e^(B cos(theta)), have the unique
property of producing equal numbers of bursts per logarithmic interval in Eiso,
and therefore in most burst properties. Since this broad distribution of burst
properties is a key feature found by HETE-2, a Fisher-shaped universal jet
model can explain many of the observed properties of XRFs, X-ray-rich GRBs, and
GRBs reasonably well, in contrast to a power-law universal model. For small
viewing angles, the Fisher distribution can be approximated by a Gaussian,
whose properties have been explored by Zhang et al. (2004). We also show that
the Fisher universal jet model produces a broad distribution in the inferred
radiated energy Egamma_inf, in contrast to the narrow distribution predicted by
the uniform variable opening-angle jet model Lamb, Donaghy & Graziani (2005).
Here we present Monte Carlo simulations of both a Fisher-shaped universal jet
model and a Fisher-shaped variable opening-angle jet model.",2005-05-08T16:49:45Z

The Local Shape of the Universe in the Inflationary Limit,"Recent high precision data by WMAP and SDSS have provided strong evidence to
suggest that the universe is nearly flat. They are also making it possible to
probe the topology of the universe. Motivated by these results, we have
recently studied the consequences of taking the inflationary limit, i.e.
$|\Omega_0 - 1| << 1$. We have shown that in this limit a generic detectable
spherical or hyperbolic topology is locally indistinguishable from either $R^2
x S^1$ or $R x T^2$, irrespective of its global shape. Here we briefly present
these results and further discuss their observational implications.",2005-03-31T01:10:16Z
"SCUBA sub-millimeter observations of gamma-ray bursters III. GRB 030329:
  The brightest sub-millimeter afterglow to date","We discuss our ongoing program of Target of Opportunity (ToO) sub-millimeter
observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) using the Sub-millimetre Common-User
Bolometer Array (SCUBA) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). In this
paper, we present all the ToO observations of GRB 030329. This was by far the
brightest sub-millimeter afterglow seen to date. The flux density at 850
microns was approximately constant up to a break that took place ~7 days after
the burst. This was consistent with being a jet break. The 850 micron results
agree with those at longer wavelengths that show a brighter flux ~7 days after
the burst, right at the time of the break. No short-lived large-scale
brightenings were detected in the sub-millimeter light curve. However, the 850
micron light curve may have had a drop <~ 16 days after the burst. The peak of
the afterglow emission was at ~90 GHz in the days before the break in the light
curve. A simple modeling is consistent with the spectral indices remaining the
same as the afterglow evolved, with the breaks in the spectrum moving to longer
wavelengths at later times and the flux at the peak falling. No significant
sub-millimeter emission was detected from the host galaxy.",2005-03-26T00:21:22Z
"Detecting Dark Matter Annihilation with CMB Polarization : Signatures
  and Experimental Prospects","Dark matter (DM) annihilation during hydrogen recombination (z ~ 1000) will
alter the recombination history of the Universe, and affect the observed CMB
temperature and polarization fluctuations. Unlike other astrophysical probes of
DM, this is free of the significant uncertainties in modelling galactic
physics, and provides a method to detect and constrain the cosmological
abundances of these particles. We parametrize the effect of DM annihilation as
an injection of ionizing energy at a rate e_{dm}, and argue that this simple
""on the spot'' modification is a good approximation to the complicated
interaction of the annihilation products with the photon-electron plasma.
Generic models of DM do not change the redshift of recombination, but change
the residual ionization after recombination. This broadens the surface of last
scattering, suppressing the temperature fluctuations and enhancing the
polarization fluctuations. We use the temperature and polarization angular
power spectra to measure these deviations from the standard recombination
history, and therefore, indirectly probe DM annihilation. (abridged)",2005-03-23T20:26:19Z
Data Mining in Gamma Astrophysics Experiments,"Data mining techniques, including clustering and classification tasks, for
the automatic information extraction from large datasets are increasingly
demanded in several scientific fields. In particular, in the astrophysical
field, large archives and digital sky surveys with dimensions of 10E12 bytes
currently exist, while in the near future they will reach sizes of the order of
10E15. In this work we propose a multidimensional indexing method to
efficiently query and mine large astrophysical datasets. A novelty detection
algorithm, based on the Support Vector Clustering and using density and
neighborhood information stored in the index structure, is proposed to find
regions of interest in data characterized by isotropic noise. We show an
application of this method for the detection of point sources from a gamma-ray
photon list.",2005-03-24T15:23:27Z
Blueshifted [O III] Emission: Indications of a Dynamic NLR,"The [O III] 5007 line is commonly used as an indicator of the systemic
redshift of AGNs. Also, recent studies have used the width of this emission
line as a proxy for the stellar velocity dispersion in the host galaxy. This
paper calls both of these assumptions into question by analyzing a sample of
approximately 400 AGN spectra from the first data release of the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey. These spectra show that the low-ionization forbidden lines ([O II],
[N II], [S II]) define a consistent redshift, but that the peak of the [O III]
line is blueshifted in approximately half of the AGNs with respect to that
redshift. For the sample studied here, the average shift is 40 km/s, with the
largest shift being over 400 km/s. The magnitude of this shift is found to be
correlated with a number of properties, including the width of the [O III] line
and the Eddington ratio (L/L$_{Edd}$), derived from the luminosity and width of
H-beta.",2005-05-06T15:30:09Z
Analysis of DA White Dwarfs from the McCook & Sion Catalog,"The Sloan Digital Sky Survey has already doubled the number of
spectroscopically identified white dwarfs. However, there remains a wealth of
white dwarfs in the McCook & Sion catalog for which little or nothing is known.
We have thus undertaken a spectroscopic survey of all Northern hemisphere DA
white dwarfs from this catalog in order to (1) confirm the spectroscopic
classification, and (2) provide measurements of Teff and log g for each star.
As part of this project, we have also secured spectroscopic data for all DA
stars with high-speed photometric measurements available, in order to study the
purity of the ZZ Ceti instability strip, which has recently been challenged,

"Local Supercluster Dynamics: External Tidal Impact of the PSCz sample
  traced by Optimized Numerical Least Action Method","We assess the extent to which the PSCz survey encapsulates the complete or
major share of matter inhomogeneities responsible for the external tidal forces
affecting the peculiar velocity flow within the Local Supercluster [LS]. We
investigate this issue on the basis of mock galaxy catalogs drawn from two
large Nbody simulations of cosmic structure formation in two different
cosmological scenarios. From these a variety of datasets is selected imitating
the observational conditions of either the volume-limited LS mimicking NBG
catalog or the deeper magnitude-limited PSCz catalog. The mildly nonlinear
dynamics in the mock NBG and PSCz velocities are analyzed by means of an
optimized implementation of the Least Action Principle, the Fast Action Method
[FAM]. By comparing the modeled and true velocities of the corresponding mock
catalogs we assess the extent and nature of the external tidal influence on the
LS volume. We find that the dynamics in the inner 30Mpc/h volume is strongly
affected by the external forces. Most of the external forces can be traced back
to a depth of no more than 100Mpc/h. This is concluded from the fact that the
FAM reconstructions of the 100Mpc/h PSCz volume appear to have included most
gravitational influences. In addition, we demonstrate that for all considered
cosmological models the bulk flow and shear components of the tidal velocity
field generated by the external distribution of PSCz galaxies provides
sufficient information for representing the full external tidal force field.",2005-06-16T08:13:07Z
The redshift distribution of gamma-ray bursts revisited,"In this letter, we calculate the redshift distribution of gamma-ray bursts
assuming that they trace (i) the globally averaged star formation rate or (ii)
the average metallicity in the Universe. While at redshifts 5 and below, both
the star formation rate and metallicity are observationally determined modulo
some uncertainties, at higher redshifts there are few constraints. We
extrapolate the star formation rate and metallicity to higher redshifts and
explore models that are broadly consistent with bounds on the optical depth
from WMAP results. In addition, we also include parametric descriptions of the
luminosity function, and the typical spectrum for GRBs. With these essential
ingredients included in the modeling, we find that a substantial fraction 75%
of GRBs are expected to originate at redshifts below 4, in variance with some
previous estimates. Conversely, if we assume as expected for the collapsar
model that gamma-ray bursts favour a low metallicity environment and therefore,
relate the GRB rate to a simple model of the average metallicity as a function
of redshift, we find that a higher fraction of bursts, about 40% originate from
redshifts greater than 4. We conclude with the implications of SWIFT GRB
detections.",2005-05-24T20:37:07Z
Gamma-Ray Emission from Microquasars,"Microquasars, X-ray binary systems that generate relativistic jets, were
discovered in our Galaxy in the last decade of the XXth century. Their name
indicates that they are manifestations of the same physics as quasars but on a
completely different scale. Parallel to this discovery, the EGRET instrument on
board of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory detected 271 point like gamma-ray
sources 170 of which were not clearly identified with known objects. This
marked the beginning of gamma-ray source population studies in the Galaxy. We
present in this thesis models for gamma-ray production in microquasars with the
aim to propose them as possible parent populations for different groups of
EGRET unidentified sources. These models are developed for a variety of
scenarios taking into account several possible combinations, i.e. black holes
or neutron stars as the compact object, low mass or high mass stellar
companions, as well as leptonic or hadronic gamma-ray production processes. We
also show that the presented models for gamma-rays emitting microquasars can be
used to explain observations from well known sources that are detected in
energy ranges other than EGRET's. Finally, we include an alternative gamma-ray
producing situation that does not involve microquasars but a specific
unidentified EGRET source possibly linked to a magnetized accreting pulsar.",2005-04-22T12:56:41Z
"Carbon monoxide in the solar atmosphere I. Numerical method and
  two-dimensional models","The radiation hydrodynamic code CO5BOLD has been supplemented with the
time-dependent treatment of chemical reaction networks. Advection of particle
densities due to the hydrodynamic flow field is also included. The radiative
transfer is treated frequency-independently, i.e. grey, so far. The upgraded
code has been applied to two-dimensional simulations of carbon monoxide (CO) in
the non-magnetic solar photosphere and low chromosphere. For this purpose a
reaction network has been constructed, taking into account the reactions which
are most important for the formation and dissociation of CO under the physical
conditions of the solar atmosphere. The network has been strongly reduced to 27
reactions, involving the chemical species H, H2, C, O, CO, CH, OH, and a
representative metal. The resulting CO number density is highest in the cool
regions of the reversed granulation pattern at mid-photospheric heights and
decreases strongly above. There, the CO abundance stays close to a value of 8.3
on the usual logarithmic abundance scale with [H]=12 but is reduced in hot
shock waves which are a ubiquitous phenomenon of the model atmosphere. For
comparison, the corresponding equilibrium densities have been calculated, based
on the reaction network but also under assumption of instantaneous chemical
equilibrium by applying the Rybicki & Hummer (RH) code by Uitenbroek (2001).
Owing to the short chemical timescales, the assumption holds for a large
fraction of the atmosphere, in particular the photosphere. In contrast, the CO
number density deviates strongly from the corresponding equilibrium value in
the vicinity of chromospheric shock waves. Simulations with altered reaction
network clearly show that the formation channel via hydroxide (OH) is the most
important one under the conditions of the solar atmosphere.",2005-03-23T16:48:58Z
A Model for Multidimensional Delayed Detonations in SN Ia Explosions,"We show that a flame tracking/capturing scheme originally developed for
deflagration fronts can be used to model thermonuclear detonations in
multidimensional explosion simulations of type Ia supernovae. After testing the
accuracy of the front model, we present a set of two-dimensional simulations of
delayed detonations with a physically motivated off-center
deflagration-detonation-transition point. Furthermore, we demonstrate the
ability of the front model to reproduce the full range of possible interactions
of the detonation with clumps of burned material. This feature is crucial for
assessing the viability of the delayed detonation scenario.",2005-03-29T12:13:34Z
"The UV, Optical, and IR Properties of SDSS Sources Detected by GALEX","We discuss the UV, optical, and IR properties of the SDSS sources detected by
GALEX as part of its All-sky Imaging Survey Early Release Observations.
Virtually all of the GALEX sources in the overlap region are detected by SDSS.
GALEX sources represent ~2.5% of all SDSS sources within these fields and about
half are optically unresolved. Most unresolved GALEX/SDSS sources are bright
blue turn-off thick disk stars and are typically detected only in the GALEX
near-UV band. The remaining unresolved sources include low-redshift quasars,
white dwarfs, and white dwarf/M dwarf pairs, and these dominate the optically
unresolved sources detected in both GALEX bands.
  Almost all the resolved SDSS sources detected by GALEX are fainter than the
SDSS 'main' spectroscopic limit. These sources have colors consistent with
those of blue (spiral) galaxies (u-r<2.2), and most are detected in both GALEX
bands. Measurements of their UV colors allow much more accurate and robust
estimates of star-formation history than are possible using only SDSS data.
Indeed, galaxies with the most recent (<20 Myr) star formation can be robustly
selected from the GALEX data by requiring that they be brighter in the far-UV
than in the near-UV band. However, older starburst galaxies have UV colors
similar to AGN, and thus cannot be selected unambiguously on the basis of GALEX
fluxes alone.
  With the aid of 2MASS data, we construct and discuss median 10 band
UV-optical-IR spectral energy distributions for turn-off stars, hot white
dwarfs, low-redshift quasars, and spiral and elliptical galaxies. We point out
the high degree of correlation between the UV color and the contribution of the
UV flux to the UV-optical-IR flux of galaxies detected by GALEX.",2005-05-16T22:26:57Z
"RFI Identification and Mitigation Using Simultaneous Dual Station
  Observations","RFI mitigation is a critically important issue in radio astronomy using
existing instruments as well as in the development of next-generation radio
telescopes, such as the Square Kilometer Array (SKA). Most designs for the SKA
involve multiple stations with spacings of up to a few thousands of kilometers
and thus can exploit the drastically different RFI environments at different
stations. As demonstrator observations and analysis for SKA-like instruments,
and to develop RFI mitigation schemes that will be useful in the near term, we
recently conducted simultaneous observations with Arecibo Observatory and the
Green Bank Telescope (GBT). The observations were aimed at diagnosing RFI and
using the mostly uncorrelated RFI between the two sites to excise RFI from
several generic kinds of measurements such as giant pulses from Crab-like
pulsars and weak HI emission from galaxies in bands heavily contaminated by
RFI. This paper presents observations, analysis, and RFI identification and
excision procedures that are effective for both time series and spectroscopy
applications using multi-station data.",2005-02-07T21:36:46Z
"Numerical 3+1 general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics: a local
  characteristic approach","We present a general procedure to solve numerically the general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) equations within the framework of the 3+1
formalism. The work reported here extends our previous investigation in general
relativistic hydrodynamics (Banyuls et al. 1997) where magnetic fields were not
considered. The GRMHD equations are written in conservative form to exploit
their hyperbolic character in the solution procedure. All theoretical
ingredients necessary to build up high-resolution shock-capturing schemes based
on the solution of local Riemann problems (i.e. Godunov-type schemes) are
described. In particular, we use a renormalized set of regular eigenvectors of
the flux Jacobians of the relativistic magnetohydrodynamics equations. In
addition, the paper describes a procedure based on the equivalence principle of
general relativity that allows the use of Riemann solvers designed for special
relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in GRMHD. Our formulation and numerical
methodology are assessed by performing various test simulations recently
considered by different authors. These include magnetized shock tubes,
spherical accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole, equatorial accretion onto
a Kerr black hole, and magnetized thick accretion disks around a black hole
prone to the magnetorotational instability.",2005-06-02T16:04:46Z
"FUSE observations of molecular hydrogen on the line of sight towards
  HD141569A","We present an analysis of the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE)
spectrum of HD141569A, a transitional object known to possess a circumstellar
disk. We observe two components of gas at widely different temperatures along
the line of sight. We detect cold H2, which is thermalized up to J=2 at a
kinetic temperature of 51K. Such low temperatures are typical of the diffuse
interstellar medium. Since the line of sight to HD141569A does not pass through
its disk, it appears that we are observing the cold H2 in a low extinction
envelope associated with the high Galactic latitude dark cloud complex L134N,
which is in the same direction and at nearly the same distance as HD141569A.
The column densities of the higher J-levels of H2 suggest the presence of warm
gas along the line of sight. The excitation conditions do not seem to be
consistent with what is generally observed in diffuse interstellar clouds. The
observed radial velocity of the gas implies that the UV spectral lines we
observe are likely interstellar in origin rather than circumstellar, although
our absorption line study does not definitely rule out the possibility that the
warm gas is close to the star. The discovery of such warm gas along the line of
sight may provide evidence for turbulent phenomena in the dark cloud L134N.",2005-06-13T15:34:39Z
Thermal Evolution of a Pulsating Neutron Star,"We have derived a set of equations to describe the thermal evolution of a
neutron star which undergoes small-amplitude radial pulsations. We have taken
into account, in the frame of the General Theory of Relativity, the pulsation
damping due to the bulk and shear viscosity and the accompanying heating of the
star. The neutrino emission of a pulsating non-superfluid star and its heating
due to the bulk viscosity are calculated assuming that both processes are
determined by the non-equilibrium modified Urca process. Analytical and
numerical solutions to the set of equations of the stellar evolution are
obtained for linear and strongly non-linear deviations from beta-equilibrium.
It is shown that a pulsating star may be heated to very high temperatures,
while the pulsations damp very slowly with time (a power law damping for
100-1000 years), as long as the damping is determined by the bulk viscosity.
The contribution of the shear viscosity to the damping becomes important in a
rather cool star with a low pulsation energy.",2005-02-28T17:05:53Z
"The Afterglows, Redshifts, and Properties of Swift Gamma-Ray Bursts","We present optical, near-IR, and radio follow up of sixteen Swift bursts,
including our discovery of nine afterglows and a redshift determination for
three. These observations, supplemented by data from the literature, provide an
afterglow recovery rate of 60% in the optical/near-IR, much higher than in
previous missions (BeppoSAX, HETE-2, INTEGRAL, and IPN). The optical/near-IR
afterglows of Swift events are on average 1.7 mag fainter at t=12 hr than those
of previous missions. The X-ray afterglows are similarly fainter compared to
those of pre-Swift bursts. In the radio the limiting factor is the VLA
threshold and the detection rate for Swift bursts is similar to that for past
missions. The redshift distribution of pre-Swift bursts peaked at z~1, whereas
the five Swift bursts with measured redshifts are distributed evenly between
1.3 and 3.2. From these results we conclude that (i) the pre-Swift
distributions were biased in favor of bright events and low redshift events,
(ii) the higher sensitivity and accurate positions of Swift result in a better
representation of the true burst redshift and brightness distributions (which
are higher and dimmer, respectively), and (iii) as many as 1/3 of the bursts
can be optically dark, as a result of a high redshift and/or dust extinction.
We remark that the apparent lack of low redshift, low luminosity Swift bursts,
and the lower event rate compared to pre-launch estimates (90 vs. 150 per
year), are the result of a threshold that is similar to that of BATSE. In view
of these inferences, afterglow observers may find it advisable to make
significant changes in follow up strategies of Swift events. [abridged]",2005-05-06T19:31:48Z
Dark Energy Stars,"Event horizons and closed time-like curves cannot exist in the real world for
the simple reason that they are inconsistent with quantum mechanics. Following
ideas originated by Robert Laughlin, Pawel Mazur, Emil Mottola, David Santiago,
and the speaker it is now possible to describe in some detail what happens
physically when one approaches and crosses a region of space-time where
classical general relativity predicts there should be an infinite red shift
surface. This quantum critical physics provides a new perspective on a variety
of enigmatic astrophysical phenomena, including supernovae explosions, gamma
ray bursts, positron emission, and dark matter.",2005-03-08T23:25:26Z
Further Wolf-Rayet stars in the starburst cluster Westerlund 1,"We present new low and intermediate-resolution spectroscopic observations of
the Wolf Rayet (WR) star population in the massive starburst cluster Westerlund
1. Finding charts are presented for five new WRs - four WNL and one WCL -
raising the current total of known WRs in the cluster to 19. We also present
new spectra and correct identifications for the majority of the 14 WR stars
previously known, notably confirming the presence of two WNVL stars. Finally we
briefly discuss the massive star population of Westerlund 1 in comparison to
other massive young galactic clusters.",2005-03-14T21:22:51Z
"IRS 16SW - A New Comoving Group of Young Stars in the Central Parsec of
  the Milky Way","One of the most perplexing problems associated with the supermassive black
hole at the center of our Galaxy is the origin of the young stars in its close
vicinity. Using proper motion measurements and stellar number density counts
based on 9 years of diffraction-limited K(2.2 micron)-band speckle imaging at
the W. M. Keck 10-meter telescopes, we have identified a new comoving group of
stars, which we call the IRS 16SW comoving group, located 1.9"" (0.08 pc, in
projection) from the central black hole. Four of the five members of this
comoving group have been spectroscopically identified as massive young stars,
specifically He I emission-line stars and OBN stars. This is the second young
comoving group within the central parsec of the Milky Way to be recognized and
is the closest, by a factor of 2, in projection to the central black hole.
These comoving groups may be the surviving cores of massive infalling star
clusters that are undergoing disruption in the strong tidal field of the
central supermassive black hole.",2005-04-12T19:02:34Z
"Spiral Structure when Setting up Pericentre Glow: Possible Giant Planets
  at Hundreds of AU in the HD141569 Disk","This paper discusses the impact of introducing a planet on an eccentric orbit
into a planetesimal disk. That planet's secular perturbations cause the orbits
of the planetesimals to evolve in such a way that at any one time planetesimals
at the same distance from the star have common pericentres and eccentricities.
This causes the surface density distribution of an extended planetesimal disk
to exhibit two spirals, one exterior the other interior to the planet's orbit.
These two spirals unwind in different directions and their structure is
described by two parameters: the time since the planet was introduced and the
planet's eccentricity. At late times the spirals become tightly wound and the
offset centre of symmetry of the pericentre glow approximation is recovered.
Comparison with spiral structure seen in the HD141569 disk shows that its
spiral at 325 AU is similar to that caused by introducing a planet 5 Myr ago
with a mass 0.2-2M_Jup orbiting at 235-250 AU with an eccentricity of 0.05-0.2;
likewise a Saturn mass planet at 150 AU would cause structure like that seen at
200 AU. More definitive statements about any planets orbiting HD141569 from
this model could be made once the effect of the binary companion on the disk is
known, and once the disk's structure has been better characterised down to 100
AU, including the location of the star within the disk. The relatively young
age of this system (~5 Myr) means that if giant planets really do exist at
hundreds of AU from HD141569, this provides a unique opportunity to set
constraints on the mechanism by which those planets came to be at such large
distances.",2005-06-09T15:10:42Z
"Large Scale Cosmological Inhomogeneities, Inflation and Acceleration
  Without Dark Matter","We describe the universe as a local, inhomogeneous spherical bubble embedded
in a flat matter dominated FLRW universe. Generalized exact Friedmann equations
describe the expansion of the universe and an early universe inflationary de
Sitter solution is obtained. A non-perturbative expression for the deceleration
parameter q is derived that can possibly describe the acceleration of the
universe without dark energy, due to the effects associated with very long wave
length super-horizon inflationary perturbations. The suggestion by Kolbe et al.
[9] that long wave length super-horizon inflationary modes can affect a local
observable through inhomogeneities is considered in the light of our exact
inhomogeneous model.",2005-03-31T22:18:15Z
"SINFONI in the Galactic Center: young stars and IR flares in the central
  light month","We report 75 milli-arcsec resolution, near-IR imaging spectroscopy within the
central 30 light days of the Galactic Center [...]. To a limiting magnitude of
K~16, 9 of 10 stars in the central 0.4 arcsec, and 13 of 17 stars out to 0.7
arcsec from the central black hole have spectral properties of B0-B9, main
sequence stars. [...] all brighter early type stars have normal rotation
velocities, similar to solar neighborhood stars. We [...] derive improved 3d
stellar orbits for six of these S-stars in the central 0.5 arcsec. Their
orientations in space appear random. Their orbital planes are not co-aligned
with those of the two disks of massive young stars 1-10 arcsec from SgrA*. We
can thus exclude [...] that the S-stars as a group inhabit the inner regions of
these disks. They also cannot have been located/formed in these disks [...].
[...] we conclude that the S-stars were most likely brought into the central
light month by strong individual scattering events. The updated estimate of
distance to the Galactic center from the S2 orbit fit is Ro = 7.62 +/- 0.32
kpc, resulting in a central mass value of 3.61 +/- 0.32 x 10^6 Msun. We
happened to catch two smaller flaring events from SgrA* [...]. The 1.7-2.45 mum
spectral energy distributions of these flares are fit by a featureless, red
power law [...]. The observed spectral slope is in good agreement with
synchrotron models in which the infrared emission comes from [...] radiative

Pulsations induced by deuterium-burning in young brown dwarfs,"Very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs can undergo pulsational instability
excited by central deuterium burning during the initial phases of their
evolution. We present the results of evolutionary and nonadiabatic linear
stability models that show the presence of unstable fundamental modes. The
pulsation periods vary bewteen ~5 hr for a 0.1 Msun star and ~1 hr for a 0.02
M$_\odot$ brown dwarf. The results are rather insensitive to variations in the
input physics of the models. We show the location of the instability strip in
the HR and c-m diagrams and discuss the observational searches for young
pulsators in nearby star forming regions.",2005-02-09T15:43:22Z
Structure in the motions of the fastest halo stars,"We have analyzed the catalog of 2106 non-kinematically selected metal poor
stars in the solar neighborhood published by Beers et al. (2000), with the goal
of quantifying the amount of substructure in the motions of the fastest halo
stars. We have computed the two-point velocity correlation function for a
subsample of halo stars within 1-2 kpc of the Sun, and found statistical
evidence of substructure, with a similar amplitude to that predicted by high
resolution CDM simulations. The signal is due to a small kinematic group whose
dynamical properties are compared to the stellar ""stream"", previously
discovered by Helmi et al. (1999). If real, this high velocity moving group
would provide further support to the idea that substructures remain as fossils
from the formation of the Galaxy as expected in the CDM scenario.",2005-04-05T15:28:44Z
"The Leiden/Argentine/Bonn (LAB) Survey of Galactic HI: Final data
  release of the combined LDS and IAR surveys with improved stray-radiation
  corrections","We present the final data release of observations of lambda 21-cm emission
from Galactic neutral hydrogen over the entire sky, merging the
Leiden/Dwingeloo Survey (LDS: Hartmann & Burton, 1997) of the sky north of
delta = -30 deg with the Instituto Argentino de Radioastronomia Survey (IAR:
Arnal et al., 2000, and Bajaja et al., 2005) of the sky south of delta = -25
deg. The angular resolution of the combined material is HPBW ~ 0.6 deg. The LSR
velocity coverage spans the interval -450 km/s to +400 km/s, at a resolution of
1.3 km/s. The data were corrected for stray radiation at the Institute for
Radioastronomy of the University of Bonn, refining the original correction
applied to the LDS. The rms brightness-temperature noise of the merged database
is 0.07 - 0.09 K. Residual errors in the profile wings due to defects in the
correction for stray radiation are for most of the data below a level of 20 -
40 mK. It would be necessary to construct a telescope with a main beam
efficiency of eta_{MB} > 99% to achieve the same accuracy. The merged and
refined material entering the LAB Survey of Galactic HI is intended to be a
general resource useful to a wide range of studies of the physical and
structural characteristices of the Galactic interstellar environment. The LAB
Survey is the most sensitive Milky Way HI survey to date, with the most
extensive coverage both spatially and kinematically.",2005-04-06T10:22:38Z
Rotational modulation of X-ray emission in Orion Nebula young stars,"We investigate the spatial distribution of X-ray emitting plasma in a sample
of young Orion Nebula Cluster stars by modulation of their X-ray light-curves
due to stellar rotation. The study, part of the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project
(COUP), is made possible by the exceptional length of the observation: 10 days
of ACIS integration during a time span of 13 days, yielding a total of 1616
detected sources in the 17x17 arcmin field of view. We here focus on a
subsample of 233 X-ray-bright stars with known rotational periods. We search
for X-ray modulation using the Lomb Normalized Periodogram method.
  X-ray modulation related to the rotation period is detected in at least 23
stars with periods between 2 and 12 days and relative amplitudes ranging from
20% to 70%. In 16 cases, the X-ray modulation period is similar to the stellar
rotation period while in seven cases it is about half that value, possibly due
to the presence of X-ray emitting structures at opposite stellar longitudes.
These results constitute the largest sample of low mass stars in which X-ray
rotational modulation has been observed. The detection of rotational modulation
indicates that the X-ray emitting regions are distributed inhomogeneneously in
longitude and do not extend to distances significantly larger than the stellar
radius. Modulation is observed in stars with saturated activity levels
(L_X/L_bol ~ 10^(-3)) showing that saturation is not due to the filling of the
stellar surface with X-ray emitting regions.",2005-06-08T10:27:55Z
"Imaging of SDSS z>6 quasar fields: gravitational lensing, companion
  galaxies and the host dark matter halos","We have undertaken deep optical imaging observations of three 6.2<z<6.5
quasar fields in the i' and z' filters. These data are used to search for
foreground galaxies which are gravitationally lensing the quasars and distant
galaxies physically associated with the quasars. Foreground galaxies are found
closer than 5 arcsec from the lines-of-sight of two of the three quasars.
However, the faintness of these galaxies suggests they have fairly low masses
and provide only weak magnifications (mu<1.1). No convincing galaxies
physically associated with the quasars are found and the number of i'-band
dropouts is consistent with that found in random fields. We consider the
expected dark matter halo masses which host these quasars under the assumption
that a correlation between black hole mass and dark matter halo mass exists. We
show that the steepness of the high-mass tail of the halo mass function at this
redshift, combined with realistic amounts of scatter in this correlation, lead
to expected halo masses substantially lower than previously believed. This
analysis can explain the lack of companion galaxies found here and the low
dynamical mass recently published for one of the quasars.",2005-03-08T23:57:20Z
"Investigating Ca II emission in the RS CVn binary ER Vulpeculae using
  the Broadening Function Formalism","The synchronously rotating G stars in the detached, short-period (0.7 d),
partially eclipsing binary, ER Vul, are the most chromospherically active
solar-type stars known. We have monitored activity in the Ca II H & K reversals
for almost an entire orbit. Rucinski's Broadening Function Formalism allows the
photospheric contribution to be objectively subtracted from the highly blended
spectra. The power of the BF technique is also demonstrated by the good
agreement of radial velocities with those measured by others from less crowded
spectral regions. In addition to strong Ca II emission from the primary and
secondary, there appears to be a high-velocity stream flowing onto the
secondary where it stimulates a large active region on the surface 30 - 40
degrees in advance of the sub-binary longitude. A model light curve with a spot
centered on the same longitude also gives the best fit to the observed light
curve. A flare with approximately 13% more power than at other phases was
detected in one spectrum. We suggest ER Vul may offer a magnified view of the
more subtle chromospheric effects synchronized to planetary revolution seen in
certain `51 Peg'-type systems.",2005-04-20T03:49:53Z
"HST and UKIRT Observations of the Center of the Trifid Nebula: Evidence
  for the Photoevaporation of a Proplyd and a Protostellar Condensation","The Trifid nebula (M20) is a well-known prominent optical HII region
trisected by bands of obscuring dust lanes and excited by an O7.5 star HD
164492A. Previous near-IR, mid-IR and radio continuum observations of the
cluster of stars at the center of the Trifid nebula indicated circumstellar
disks associated with hot stars with envelopes that are photoionized externally
by the UV radiation from the hot central star, HD 164492A. Using WFPC2 of the
HST, we present evidence of a resolved proplyd in H$\alpha$ and [SII] line
emission from a stellar source emitting cool dust emission. Using UKIRT, an
infrared observation of the stellar source with a proplyd indicates a late F --
mid G spectral type. We also note a remarkable complex of filamentary and
sheet-like structures which appear to arise from the edge of a protostellar
condensation. These observations are consistent with a picture in which the
bright massive star HD 164492A is responsible for the photoevaporation of
protoplanetary disks of other less-massive members of the cluster as well as
the closest protostellar condensation facing the central cluster. Using the
evidence for a proplyd, we argue that the massive and intermediate mass members
of the cluster, HD 164492C (B6 star) and HD 164492 (Herbig Be star) have disks
associated with them.",2005-05-08T17:04:32Z
"Testing homogeneity on large scales in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data
  Release One","The assumption that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales
is one of the fundamental postulates of cosmology. We have tested the large
scale homogeneity of the galaxy distribution in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
Data Release One (SDSS-DR1) using volume limited subsamples extracted from the
two equatorial strips which are nearly two dimensional (2D). The galaxy
distribution was projected on the equatorial plane and we carried out a 2D
multi-fractal analysis by counting the number of galaxies inside circles of
different radii in the range 5 Mpc/h to 150 Mpc/h centred on galaxies.
Different moments of the count-in-cells were analysed to identify a range of
length-scales (60-70 Mpc/h to 150Mpc/h) where the moments show a power law
scaling behaviour and to determine the scaling exponent which gives the
spectrum of generalised dimension D_q. If the galaxy distribution is
homogeneous, D_q does not vary with q and is equal to the Euclidean dimension
which in our case is 2. We find that D_q varies in the range 1.7 to 2.2. We
also constructed mock data from random, homogeneous point distributions and
from LCDM N-body simulations with bias b=1, 1.6 and 2, and analysed these in
exactly the same way. The values of D_q in the random distribution and the
unbiased simulations show much smaller variations and these are not consistent
with the actual data. The biased simulations, however, show larger variations
in D_q and these are consistent with both the random and the actual data.
Interpreting the actual data as a realisation of a biased LCDM universe, we
conclude that the galaxy distribution is homogeneous on scales larger than
60-70 Mpc/h.",2005-04-14T04:56:19Z
Cosmic Mimicry: Is LCDM a Braneworld in Disguise ?,"For a broad range of parameter values, braneworld models display a remarkable
property which we call cosmic mimicry. Cosmic mimicry is characterized by the
fact that, at low redshifts, the Hubble parameter in the braneworld model is
virtually indistinguishable from that in the LCDM cosmology. An important point
to note is that the \Omega_m parameters in the braneworld model and in the LCDM
cosmology can nevertheless be quite different. Thus, at high redshifts (early
times), the braneworld asymptotically expands like a matter-dominated universe
with the value of \Omega_m inferred from the observations of the local matter
density. At low redshifts (late times), the braneworld model behaves almost
exactly like the LCDM model but with a renormalized value of the cosmological
density parameter \Omega_m^{LCDM}. The redshift which characterizes cosmic
mimicry is related to the parameters in the higher-dimensional braneworld
Lagrangian. Cosmic mimicry is a natural consequence of the scale-dependence of
gravity in braneworld models. The change in the value of the cosmological
density parameter is shown to be related to the spatial dependence of the
effective gravitational constant in braneworld theory. A subclass of mimicry
models lead to an older age of the universe and also predict a redshift of
reionization which is lower than z_{reion} \simeq 17 in the LCDM cosmology.
These models might therefore provide a background cosmology which is in better
agreement both with the observed quasar abundance at z \gsim 4 and with the
large optical depth to reionization measured by the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe.",2005-04-30T06:53:11Z
"UV to Mid-IR Observations of Star-forming Galaxies at z~2: Stellar
  Masses and Stellar Populations","We present the broad-band UV through mid-infrared spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of a sample of 72 spectroscopically-confirmed star-forming
galaxies at z=2.30+/-0.3. Located in a 72 arcmin-squared field centered on the
bright background QSO, HS1700+643, these galaxies were pre-selected to lie at
z~2 based solely on their rest-frame UV colors and luminosities, and should be
representative of UV-selected samples at high redshift. In addition to deep
ground-based photometry spanning from 0.35-2.15 microns, we make use of
Spitzer/IRAC data, which probes the rest-frame near-IR at z~2. The range of
stellar populations present in the sample is investigated with simple,
single-component stellar population synthesis models. Emphasizing stellar mass
estimates, which are less subject to systematic uncertainties than other
parameters, we find <log(M*/Msun)>=10.32+/-0.51 for the sample. Allowing for
the possibility of episodic star formation, we find that typical galaxies in
our sample could contain up to three times more stellar mass in an old
underlying burst than what was inferred from single-component modeling. In
contrast, mass estimates for the most massive galaxies in the sample (M*>10^11
Msun) are fairly insensitive to the method used to model the stellar
population. Galaxies in this massive tail, which are also the oldest objects in
the sample, could plausibly evolve into the passive galaxies discovered at
z~1.7 with near-IR selection techniques. In the general framework of
hierarchical galaxy formation and mergers, which implies episodic
star-formation histories, galaxies at high redshift may pass in and out of
UV-selected and near-IR color-selected samples as they evolve from phases of
active star formation to quiescence and back again (Abridged).",2005-03-22T21:00:25Z
"Diagnosing the outflow from the SGR 1806-20 Giant Flare with Radio
  Observations","On 2004 Dec. 27, the soft gamma repeater (SGR) 1806-20 emitted the brightest
giant flare (GF) ever detected from an SGR, with an (isotropic) energy release
$\sim 100$ times greater than the only two other known SGR GFs. It was followed
by a very bright, fading radio afterglow. Extensive follow-up radio
observations provided a wealth of information with unprecedented astrometric
precision, revealing the temporal evolution of the source size, along with
densely sampled light curves and spectra. Here we expand on our previous work
on this source, by explaining these observations within one self-consistent
dynamical model. In this scenario, the early radio emission is due to the
outflow ejected during the GF energizing a thin shell surrounding a
pre-existing cavity, where the observed steep temporal decay of the radio
emission seen beginning on day 9 is attributed to the adiabatic cooling of the
shocked shell. The shocked ejecta and external shell move outward together,
driving a forward shock into the ambient medium, and are eventually decelerated
by a reverse shock. As we show in Gelfand et al. (2005), the radio emission
from the shocked external medium naturally peaks when significant deceleration
occurs, and then decays relatively slowly. The dynamical modeling of the
collision between the ejecta and the external shell together with the observed
evolution of the source size (which is nicely reproduced in our model) suggest
that most of the energy in the outflow was in mildly relativistic material,
with an initial expansion velocity $v/c \lesssim 0.7d_{15}$, for a distance of
$15d_{15}$ kpc to SGR 1806-20. An initially highly relativistic outflow would
not have produced a long coasting phase at a mildly relativistic expansion
velocity, as was observed.",2005-03-13T20:57:14Z
Black Hole States: Accretion and Jet Ejection,"The complex spectral and timing properties of the high-energy emission from
the accretion flow in black-hole binaries, together with their strong
connection to the ejection of powerful relativistic jets from the system, can
be simplified and reduced to four basic states: hard, hard-intermediate,
soft-intermediate and soft. Unlike other classifications, these states are
based on the presence of sharp state transitions. I summarize this
classification and discuss the relation between these states and the physical
components contributing to the emitted flux.",2005-04-07T17:23:00Z
Detection of Near-IR CO Absorption Bands in R Coronae Borealis Stars,"R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars are hydrogen-deficient, carbon-rich pulsating
post-AGB stars that experience massive irregular declines in brightness caused
by circumstellar dust formation. The mechanism of dust formation around RCB
stars is not well understood. It has been proposed that CO molecules play an
important role in cooling the circumstellar gas so that dust may form. We
report on a survey for CO in a sample of RCB stars. We obtained H- and K-band
spectra including the first and second overtone CO bands for eight RCB stars,
the RCB-like star, DY Per and the final-helium-flash star, FG Sge. The first
and second overtone CO bands were detected in the cooler (T(eff)<6000 K) RCB
stars, Z Umi, ES Aql, SV Sge and DY Per. The bands are not present in the
warmer (T(eff)>6000 K) RCB stars, R CrB, RY Sgr, SU Tau, XX Cam. In addition,
first overtone bands are seen in FG Sge, a final-helium-flash star that is in
an RCB-like phase at present. Effective temperatures of the eight RCB stars
range from 4000 to 7250 K. The observed photospheric CO absorption bands were
compared to line-blanketed model spectra of RCB stars. As predicted by the
models, the CO bands are strongest in the coolest RCB stars and not present in
the warmest. No correlation was found between the presence or strength of the
CO bands and dust formation activity in the stars.",2005-03-23T14:30:50Z
"Radio-Detection Signature of High Energy Cosmic Rays by the CODALEMA
  Experiment","Taking advantage of recent technical progress which has overcome some of the
difficulties encountered in the 1960's in the radio detection of extensive air
showers induced by ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECR), a new experimental
apparatus (CODALEMA) has been built and operated. We will present the
characteristics of this device and the analysis techniques that have been
developed for observing electrical transients associated with cosmic rays.
  We find a collection of events for which both time and arrival direction
coincidences between particle and radio signals are observed. The counting rate
corresponds to shower energies $\geq 5\times 10^{16}$ eV. The performance level
which has been reached considerably enlarges the perspectives for studying
UHECR events using radio detection.",2005-04-13T15:03:47Z
"3D Simulations of the ISM pollution by SNII and SNI in dwarf spheroidal
  galaxies","We present preliminary results of 3-D hydro simulations of the interstellar
medium evolution in dwarf spheroidal galaxies undergoing star formation for the
first time. The star formation is assumed to occur in a sequence of
instantaneus bursts separated by quiescent periods. Different models are made
changing the number and the intensity of the bursts in such a way that the
final mass of the formed stars remains the same. We followed the enrichment of
the ISM taking into account the contribution of both type Ia and II supernovae.
The aim of our models is to find a star formation history compatible with the
observed spread of stellar age and metallicity in such galaxies and to
reproduce the observed mass-metallicity relation.",2005-05-02T08:44:38Z
"Electron-Ion Temperature Equilibration at Collisionless Shocks in
  Supernova Remnants","The topic of this review is the current state of our knowledge about the
degree of initial equilibration between electrons, protons and ions at
supernova remnant (SNR) shocks. Specifically, the question has been raised as
to whether there is an inverse relationship between the shock velocity and the
equilibration similar to the relationship between equilibration and Alfven Mach
number seen in interplanetary shocks (Schwartz et al 1988). This review aims to
compile every method that has been used to measure the equilibration and every
SNR on which they have been tested. I review each method, its problems and
uncertainties and how those would effect the degree of equilibration (or
velocity) inferred. The final compilation of observed electron to proton
temperature ratios as a function of shock velocity gives an accurate,
conservative picture of the state of our knowledge and the avenues we need to
pursue to make progress in our understanding of the relation between the
velocity of a shock and the degree of equilibration.",2005-03-29T22:46:26Z
Spectral properties and origin of the radio halo in A3562,"We present a new detailed multiband study of the merging cluster A3562, in
the core of the Shapley Concentration Supercluster. We analyzed new, low
frequency radio data performed at 240 MHz, 332 MHz and 610 MHz with the Giant
Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). The new GMRT data allowed us to carry out a
detailed study of the radio halo at the centre of A3562, as well as of the
head--tail radio galaxy J1333--3141 embedded in it, and of the extended
emission around the peripheral cluster galaxy J1332--3146a. Thanks to the
present observations we could derive the integrated spectrum of the radio halo
with five data points in the frequency range 240 MHz -- 1.4 GHz. Our data show
a clear steepening of the total spectrum in this frequency range. Furthermore,
by comparing the GMRT 332 MHz image with a previously published VLA 1.4 GHz
image, we produced an image of the halo spectral index distribution. The image
shows a very complex structure, with an average value of
$\alpha^{1.4GHz}_{332MHz} \sim 1.5$ and a number of knots steepening up to
$\sim 2$. We performed a combined morphological and statistical analysis using
the radio images and the quantities derived from XMM--Newton and {\it Chandra}
observations. We discuss our results in the light of particle re--acceleration
processes in galaxy clusters. In particular, we outline an overall picture,
consistent with the available radio and X-ray data, in which the cluster merger
kinematics, the injection of turbulence and B--amplification induced by the
merger between A 3562 and SC 1329--313 are jointly taken into account.",2005-05-31T09:26:53Z
Multi-epoch VERA Observations of H2O masers in OH 43.8-0.1,"We report on the multi-epoch observations of H2O maser emission in star
forming region OH 43.8-0.1 carried out with VLBI Exploration of Radio
Astrometry (VERA). The large-scale maser distributions obtained by single-beam
VLBI mapping reveal new maser spots scattered in area of 0.7 x 1.0 arcsec, in
addition to a `shell-like' structure with a scale of 0.3 x 0.5 arcsec which was
previously mapped by Downes et al.(1979). Proper motions are also obtained for
43 spots based on 5-epoch monitoring with a time span of 281 days. The
distributions of proper motions show a systematic outflow in the north-south
direction with an expansion velocity of ~8 km/s, and overall distributions of
maser spots as well as proper motions are better represented by a bipolar flow
plus a central maser cluster with a complex structure, rather than a shell with
a uniform expansion such as those found in Cep A R5 and W75N VLA2. The distance
to OH 43.8-0.1 is also estimated based on the statistical parallax, yielding D
= 2.8 +/- 0.5 kpc. This distance is consistent with a near kinematic distance
and rules out a far kinematics distance (~9 kpc), and the LSR velocity of OH
43.8-0.1 combined with the distance provides a constraint on the flatness of
the galactic rotation curve, that there is no systematic difference in rotation
speeds at the Sun and at the position of OH 43.8-0.1, which is located at the
galacto-centric radius of ~6.3 kpc.",2005-05-10T03:00:32Z
"SDSS J124058.03-015919.2: A new AM CVn star with a 37-minute orbital
  period","We present high time resolution VLT spectroscopy of SDSS J124058.03-015919.2,
a new helium-transferring binary star identified in the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey. We measure an orbital period of 37.355+/-0.002 minutes, confirming the
AM CVn nature of the system. From the velocity amplitudes of the accretor and
the accretion stream--disc impact, we derive a mass ratio q=0.039+/-0.010. Our
spectral coverage extends from 3700A--9500A and shows the presence of helium,
nitrogen, silicon and iron in the accretion disc, plus the redshifted,
low-velocity ""central spikes"" in the helium lines, known from the low-state AM
CVn stars GP Com and CE 315. Doppler tomography of the helium and silicon
emission lines reveals an unusual pattern of two bright emission sites in the
tomograms, instead of the usual one emission site identified with the impact of
the mass stream into the accretion disc. One of the two is preferred as the
conventional stream--disc impact point in velocity space, at the 3-sigma
confidence level. We speculate briefly on the origin of the second.",2005-05-17T21:17:47Z
VLA observations of broad 6-cm excited state OH lines in W49A,"Using the Very Large Array (VLA), we observed all three of the 6-cm lines of
the doublet Pi 1/2, J=1/2 state of OH with sub-arcsecond resolution (about 0.4
arcsec) in W49A. While the spatial distribution and the range in velocities of
the 6-cm lines are similar to those of the ground state (18-cm) OH lines, a
large fraction of the total emission in all three 6-cm lines has large
linewidths (about 5 -- 10 km/s) and is spatially-extended, very unlike typical
ground state OH masers which typically are point-like at VLA resolutions and
have linewidths less than 1 km/s. We find brightness temperatures of 5900 K,
4700 K, and greater than 730 K for the 4660-MHz, 4750-MHz, and 4765-MHz lines,
respectively. We conclude that these are indeed maser lines. However, the gains
are about 0.3, again very unlike the 18-cm lines which have gains greater than
10000. We compare the excited state OH emission with that from other molecules
observed with comparable angular resolution to estimate physical conditions in
the regions emitting the peculiar, low-gain maser lines. We also comment on the
relationship with the 18-cm masers",2005-04-05T16:43:16Z
"The precision of large radio continuum source catalogues- An application
  of the SPECFIND tool","The accuracy in position and flux density of 19 large radio continuum source
catalogues has been determined using SPECFIND, a new tool recently made
available through the CDS. The ~67000 radio continuum spectra with three or
more frequencies produced by SPECFIND were used to cross-correlate sources from
different catalogues and to calculate offsets in right ascension and
declination in the various catalogues with respect to the positions given in
the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) catalogue, which was adopted as a reference. The
flux densities reported in the catalogues were compared to those predicted by
the composite spectra, enabling us to assess the quality of the flux density
calibration of the different catalogues.",2005-03-30T15:27:08Z
"Reconstruction of the microlensing light curves of the Einstein Cross,
  QSO2237+0305: possible evidence of an accretion disk with a central hole","Recent OGLE (Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment) and GLITP
(Gravitational Lens International Time Project) monitoring data for QSO
2237+0305 (Huchra et al.) have been analyzed through a newly optimized N-body
microlensing analysis method, the Local HAE Caustic Modeling (LOHCAM). This
method simultaneously solves for the size of the source and N-body HAE (High
Amplification Events) caustic shapes in the source plane and determines those
sizes only as a function of the projected transverse velocity of the source. By
applying this method to the light curves of the A & C lensed components in the
Einstein Cross, these data are accurately reconstructed for the first time.
  From these modeling studies, we report several interesting results: the
minimum number of microlenses required for possible caustic models, the
possible evidence of an accretion disk with a central hole at the heart of the
quasar, the size of the UV-continuum source, the masses of the microlenses
being directly responsible for the observed HAEs, the estimated mass range of a
super massive black hole (SMBH) in QSO 2237+0305 and finally some clues for the
direction of the source motion in the sky.",2005-03-01T14:38:46Z
"Parker-Jeans Instability of Gaseous Disks Including the Effect of Cosmic
  Rays","We use linear analysis to examine the effect of cosmic rays (CRs) on the
Parker-Jeans instability of magnetized self-gravitating gaseous disks. We adopt
a slab equilibrium model in which the gravity (including self-gravity) is
perpendicular to the mid-plane, the magnetic field lies along the slab. CR is
described as a fluid and only along magnetic field lines diffusion is
considered. The linearised equations are solved numerically. The system is
susceptible to Parker-Jeans instability. In general the system is less unstable
when the CR diffusion coefficient is smaller (i.e., the coupling between the
CRs and plasma is stronger). The system is also less unstable if CR pressure is
larger. This is a reminiscence of the fact that Jeans instability and Parker
instability are less unstable when the gas pressure is larger (or temperature
is higher). Moreover, for large CR diffusion coefficient (or small CR
pressure), perturbations parallel to the magnetic field are more unstable than
those perpendicular to it. The other governing factor on the growth rate of the
perturbations in different directions is the thickness of the disk or the
strength of the external pressure on the disk. In fact, this is the determining
factor in some parameter regimes.",2005-06-07T08:42:22Z
"Iron K Features in the Quasar E 1821+643: Evidence for Gravitationally
  Redshifted Absorption?","We report a Chandra high-energy grating detection of a narrow, redshifted
absorption line superimposed on the red wing of a broad Fe K line in the
$z=0.297$ quasar E1821+643. The absorption line is detected at a confidence
level, estimated by two different methods, in the range ~2-3 sigma. Although
the detection significance is not high enough to exclude a non-astrophysical
origin, accounting for the absorption feature when modeling the X-ray spectrum
implies that the Fe-K emission line is broad, and consistent with an origin in
a relativistic accretion disk. Ignoring the apparent absorption feature leads
to the conclusion that the Fe-K emission line is narrower, and also affects the
inferred peak energy of the line (and hence the inferred ionization state of
Fe). If the absorption line (at ~6.2 keV in the quasar frame) is real, we argue
that it could be due to gravitationally redshifted Fe XXV or Fe XXVI resonance
absorption within ~10-20 gravitational radii of the putative central black
hole. The absorption line is not detected in earlier low-energy grating
observations, but is not unequivocally ruled out by these data. The Chandra
high-energy grating Fe K emission line is consistent with an origin
predominantly in Fe I-XVII or so. In a previous LEG observation the line was
double-peaked, at ~6.4 keV and ~6.9 keV (H-like Fe). Such a wide range in
ionization state of Fe is not ruled out by the HEG data and an earlier ASCA
observation, and is suggestive of a complex structure for the line-emitter.",2005-02-06T20:45:35Z
The Birth of Massive Stars and Star Clusters,"In the present-day universe, it appears that most, and perhaps all, massive
stars are born in star clusters. It also appears that all star clusters contain
stars drawn from an approximately universal initial mass function, so that
almost all rich young star clusters contain massive stars. In this review I
discuss the physical processes associated with both massive star formation and
with star cluster formation. First I summarize the observed properties of
star-forming gas clumps, then address the following questions. How do these
clumps emerge from giant molecular clouds? In these clustered environments, how
do individual stars form and gain mass? Can a forming star cluster be treated
as an equilibrium system or is this process too rapid for equilibrium to be
established? How does feedback affect the formation process?",2005-04-11T21:36:10Z
"Scalar Field Models: From the Pioneer Anomaly to Astrophysical
  Constraints","In this work we study how scalar fields may affect solar observables, and use
the constraint on the Sun's central temperature to extract bounds on the
parameters of relevant models. Also, a scalar field driven by a suitable
potential is shown to produce an anomalous acceleration similar to the one
found in the Pioneer anomaly.",2005-05-17T00:25:38Z
"Neutron Star Superfluidity, Dynamics and Precession","Basic rotational and magnetic properties of neutron superfluids and proton
superconductors in neutron stars are reviewed. The modes of precession of the
neutron superfluid are discussed in detail. We emphasize that at finite
temperature, pinning of superfluid vortices does not offer any constraint on
the precession. Any pinning energies can be surmounted by thermal activation
and there exists a dynamical steady state in which the superfluid follows the
precession of the crust at a small lag angle between the crust and superfluid
rotation velocity vectors. At this small lag the system is far from the
critical conditions for unpinning, even if the observed precession of the crust
may entail a large angle between the figure axis and the crust's rotation
velocity vector. We conclude that if long period modulations of pulse arrival
times and pulse shapes observed in a pulsar like the PSR B1828-11 are due to
the precession of the neutron star, this does not have any binding implications
about the existence of pinning by flux lines or the existence of Type II
superconductivity in the neutron star.",2005-05-04T14:58:35Z
Breaking scale invariance from a singular inflaton potential,"In this paper we break the scale invariance of the primordial power spectrum
of curvature perturbations of inflation. Introducing a singular behaviour due
to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the inflaton potential, we obtain fully
analytic expressions of scale dependent oscillation and a modulation in power
on small scale in the primordial spectrum. And we give the associated cosmic
microwave background and matter power spectra which we can observe now and
discuss the signature of the scale dependence. We also address the possibility
of whether some inflationary model with featured potential might mimic the
predictions of the scale invariant power spectrum. We present some examples
which illustrate such degeneracies.",2005-04-18T12:11:10Z
The Substellar Mass Function: A Bayesian Approach,"We report our efforts to constrain the form of the low-mass star and brown
dwarf mass function via Bayesian inference. Recent surveys of M, L, and T
dwarfs in the local solar neighborhood are an essential component of our study.
Uncertainties in the age distribution of local field stars make reliable
inference complicated. We adopt a wide range of plausible assumptions about the
rate of galactic star formation and show that their deviations from a uniform
rate produce little effect on the resulting luminosity function for a given
mass function. We use a Bayesian statistical formalism to evaluate the
probability of commonly used mass functions in light of recent discoveries. We
consider three functional forms of the mass function, include a two-segment
power law, a single power law with a low-mass cutoff, and a log-normal
distribution. Our results show that, at a 60% confidence level, the power-law
index, $\alpha$, for the low-mass arm of a two-segment power law has a value
between -0.5 and 0.5 for objects with masses between $0.04 M_{\odot}$ and $0.10
M_{\odot}$. The best-fit index is $\alpha = 0.3\pm0.6$ at the 60% confidence
level for a single-segment mass function. Current data require this function
extend to at least $0.05 M_{\odot}$ with no restrictions placed on a lower mass
cutoff. Inferences of the parameter values for a log-normal mass function are
virtually unaffected by recent estimates of the local space density of L and T
dwarfs. We find no preference among these three forms using this method. We
discuss current and future capabilities that may eventually discriminate
between mass-function models and refine estimates of their associated parameter
values.",2005-02-09T14:36:45Z
Bounds on Expected Black Hole Spins in Inspiraling Binaries,"As a first step towards understanding the angular momentum evolution history
of black holes in merging black-hole/neutron-star binaries, we perform
population synthesis calculations to track the distribution of accretion
histories of compact objects in such binaries. We find that there are three
distinct processes which can possibly contribute to the black-hole spin
magnitude: a birth spin for the black hole, imparted at either (i) the collapse
of a massive progenitor star to a black hole or (ii) the accretion-induced
collapse of a neutron star to a black hole; and (iii) an accretion spin-up when
the already formed black hole [via (i) or (ii)] goes through an accretion
episode (through an accretion disk or a common-envelope phase). Our results
show that, with regard to accretion-induced spinup in merging BH-NS binaries
[method (iii) above], only
  {\em accretion episodes associated with common-envelope phases and
hypercritical accretion rates} occur in the formation history of merging black
hole/neutron star binaries. Lacking unambiguous experimental information about
BH birth spins [i.e., regarding the results of processes (i) and (ii)], we
choose two fiducial values for the BH birth angular momentum parameter a=J/M^2,
consistent with observations of (i) NS birth spins (a roughly 0) and (ii) X-ray
binaries (a=0.5). Using these two fiducial values and a conservative upper
bound on the specific angular momentum of accreted matter, we discuss the
expected range of black hole spins in the binaries of interest. We conclude
with comments on the significance of these results for ground-based
gravitational-wave searches of inspiral signals from black hole binaries.",2005-03-09T15:19:22Z
A Northern Survey of Gamma-Ray Blazar Candidates,"In preparation for GLAST, we have compiled a sample of blazar candidates to
increase the pool of well studied AGN from which GLAST counterparts will be
drawn. Sources were selected with our Figure of Merit (FoM) ranking; thus, they
have radio and X-ray properties very similar to the EGRET blazars.
Spectroscopic confirmation of these candidates is in progress, and more than
70% of these objects have been identified as flat spectrum radio quasars and BL
Lac objects. We present ~250 new optical blazar identifications based on
McDonald Observatory spectroscopy, 224 with redshifts. Of these, 167 are in our
FoM-selected set.
  To motivate the Gamma-ray nature of these objects, we analyzed the current
release of the EGRET data for possible point sources at their radio positions.
We develop two distinct methods to combine multiple EGRET observations of a sky
position into a single detection significance. We report a detection of the
signal of the set of blazar candidates in the EGRET data at the > 3 sigma level
by both techniques. We predict that the majority of these blazar candidates
will be found by GLAST due to its increased sensitivity, duty cycle and
resolving power.",2005-03-04T22:05:04Z
GZK Photons as Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays,"We calculate the flux of ""GZK-photons"", namely the flux of Ultra High Energy
Cosmic Rays (UHECR) consisting of photons produced by extragalactic nucleons
through the resonant photoproduction of pions, the so called GZK effect. We We
calculate the flux of ""GZK-photons"", namely the flux of Ultra High Energy
Cosmic Rays (UHECR) consisting of photons produced by extragalactic nucleons
through the resonant photoproduction of pions, the so called GZK effect. We
show that, for primary nucleons, the GZK photon fraction of the total UHECR
flux is between $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-2}$ above $10^{19}$ eV and up to the order
of 0.1 above $10^{20}$ eV. The GZK photon flux depends on the assumed UHECR
spectrum, slope of the nucleon flux at the source, distribution of sources and
intervening backgrounds. Detection of this photon flux would open the way for
UHECR gamma-ray astronomy. Detection of a larger photon flux would imply the
emission of photons at the source or new physics. We compare the photon
fractions expected for GZK photons and the minimal predicted by Top-Down
models. We find that the photon fraction above $10^{19}$ eV is a crucial test
for Top-Down models.",2005-06-06T23:01:40Z
"The Radio to Infrared Emission of Very High Redshift Gamma-Ray Bursts:
  Probing Early Star Formation through Molecular and Atomic Absorption Lines","We evaluate the broadband afterglow emission of very high redshift gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) using standard relativistic blastwave models with both forward
and reverse shock components. For a broad range of parameters, a generic
property for GRBs at redshifts $z \sim$ 5--30 is that the emission peaks in the
millimeter to far-infrared bands with milli-Jansky flux levels, first at a few
hours after the burst due to the reverse shock, and then again for several days
afterwards with somewhat lower flux due to the forward shock. The radio,
submillimeter and infrared continuum emission should be readily detectable out
to $z \ga 30$ by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), Extended Very Large
Array (EVLA), Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and other facilities. For relatively
bright bursts, spectroscopic measurements of molecular and atomic absorption
lines due to ambient protostellar gas may be possible. Utilizing models of
primordial protostellar clouds, we show that under certain conditions,
appreciable absorption may be caused by HD rotational transitions even in
metal-free environments. After sufficient metal enrichment, absorption from CO
rotational transitions and [OI] fine-structure transitions can also become
strong. With appropriate observing strategies in combination with optical
telescopes, ALMA and/or SKA may be able to detect such lines, offering a unique
probe of physical conditions in individual Pop III and early Pop II star
forming regions. We also remark on potential near-infrared absorption features
due to electronic transitions of H$_2$.",2005-02-10T16:03:46Z
Rotating Quark Star in Chiral Colour Dielectric Model,"The properties of rotating quark star is studied using the equation of state
obtained from Chiral Colour Dielectric model. The results are compared with the

observational results.",2005-06-09T13:32:21Z
"Spectra of black-hole binaries in the low/hard state: from radio to
  X-rays","We propose a jet model for the low/hard state of Galactic black-hole X-ray
sources that can explain the energy spectra from radio to X-rays. The model
assumes that i) there is a magnetic field along the axis of the jet; ii) the
electron density in the jet drops inversely proportional to distance; and iii)
the electrons in the jet follow a power law distribution function. We have
performed Monte Carlo simulations of Compton upscattering of soft photons from
the accretion disk and have found power-law high-energy spectra with
photon-number index in the range 1.5 - 2 and cutoff at a few hundred keV. The
spectrum at long wavelengths (radio, infrared, optical) is modeled to come from
synchrotron radiation of the energetic electrons in the jet. We find flat to
inverted radio spectra that extend from the radio up to about the optical band.
For magnetic field strengths of the order of 10^5-10^6G at the base of the jet,
the calculated spectra agree well in slope and flux with the observations. Our
model has the advantage over other existing models that it also explains many
of the existing timing data such as the time lag spectra, the hardening of the
power density spectra and the narrowing of the autocorrelation function with
increasing photon energy.",2005-04-07T12:31:02Z
Grid services for the MAGIC experiment,"Exploring signals from the outer space has become an observational science
under fast expansion. On the basis of its advanced technology the MAGIC
telescope is the natural building block for the first large scale ground based
high energy gamma-ray observatory. The low energy threshold for gamma-rays
together with different background sources leads to a considerable amount of
data. The analysis will be done in different institutes spread over Europe.
Therefore MAGIC offers the opportunity to use the Grid technology to setup a
distributed computational and data intensive analysis system with the nowadays
available technology. Benefits of Grid computing for the MAGIC telescope are
presented.",2005-03-24T14:56:31Z
"Mapping the Kinematics of the Narrow-Line Region in the Seyfert Galaxy
  NGC 4151","Using The Hubble Space Telescope's Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph HST's
STIS, observations of the OIII emission from the narrow-line region (NLR) of
NGC 4151 were obtained and radial velocities determined. Five orbits of HST
time were used to obtain spectra at five parallel slit configurations, at a
position angle of 58 degrees, with spatial resolution 0.2 arcseconds across and
0.1 arcseconds along each slit. A spectral resolving power of ~ 9,000 with the
G430M grating gave velocity measurements accurate to ~ 34 km/s. A kinematic
model was generated to match the radial velocities, for comparison to previous
kinematic models of biconical radial outflow developed for low-dispersion
spectra at two slit positions. The new high-resolution spectra permit the
measurement of accurate velocity dispersions for each radial-velocity
component. The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) reaches a maximum of 1000 km/s
near the nucleus, and generally decreases with increasing distance to about 100
km/s in the extended narrow-line region (ENLR), starting at about 6 arcseconds
from the nucleus. In addition to the bright emission knots, which generally fit
our model, there are faint high velocity clouds which do not fit the biconical
outflow pattern of our kinematic model. These faint clouds occur at the
turnover points of the outflowing bright clouds. We suggest possible scenarios
that could explain these rogue clouds: (1) backflow resulting from shocks and
(2) outflow outside of the bicones, although the latter does not explain how
the knots are ionized and accelerated. A comparison of our observations with a
high-resolution radio map shows that there is no evidence that the kinematics
of the NLR clouds are affected by the radio lobes that comprise the inner jet.",2005-05-05T17:25:34Z
"The Relationship Between Luminosity and Broad-Line Region Size in Active
  Galactic Nuclei","We reinvestigate the relationship between the characteristic broad-line
region size (R_blr) and the Balmer emission-line, X-ray, UV, and optical
continuum luminosities. Our study makes use of the best available
determinations of R_blr for a large number of active galactic nuclei (AGNs)
from Peterson et al. Using their determinations of R_blr for a large sample of
AGNs and two different regression methods, we investigate the robustness of our
correlation results as a function of data sub-sample and regression technique.
Though small systematic differences were found depending on the method of
analysis, our results are generally consistent. Assuming a power-law relation
R_blr \propto L^\alpha, we find the mean best-fitting \alpha is about
0.67+/-0.05 for the optical continuum and the broad H\beta luminosity, about
0.56+/-0.05 for the UV continuum luminosity, and about 0.70+/-0.14 for the
X-ray luminosity. We also find an intrinsic scatter of about 40% in these
relations. The disagreement of our results with the theoretical expected slope
of 0.5 indicates that the simple assumption of all AGNs having on average same
ionization parameter, BLR density, column density, and ionizing spectral energy
distribution, is not valid and there is likely some evolution of a few of these
characteristics along the luminosity scale.",2005-04-21T20:18:19Z
RAPTOR observations of the early optical afterglow from GRB 050319,"The RAPid Telescopes for Optical Response (RAPTOR) system at Los Alamos
National Laboratory observed GRB 050319 starting 25.4 seconds after gamma-ray
emission triggered the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on-board the Swift
satellite. Our well sampled light curve of the early optical afterglow is
composed of 32 points (derived from 70 exposures) that measure the flux decay
during the first hour after the GRB. The GRB 050319 light curve measured by
RAPTOR can be described as a relatively gradual flux decline (power-law index
alpha = -0.37) with a transition, at about 400 s after the GRB, to a faster
flux decay (alpha = -0.91). The addition of other available measurements to the
RAPTOR light curve suggests that another emission component emerged after 10^4
s. We hypothesize that the early afterglow emission is powered by extended
energy injection or delayed reverse shock emission followed by the emergence of
forward shock emission.",2005-05-16T23:06:20Z
Jet Models of X-Ray Flashes,"One third of all HETE-2--localized bursts are X-Ray Flashes (XRFs), a class
of events first identified by Heise in which the fluence in the 2-30 keV energy
band exceeds that in the 30-400 keV energy band. We summarize recent HETE-2 and
other results on the properties of XRFs. These results show that the properties
of XRFs, X-ray-rich gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and GRBs form a continuum, and
thus provide evidence that all three kinds of bursts are closely related
phenomena. As the most extreme burst population, XRFs provide severe
constraints on burst models and unique insights into the structure of GRB jets,
the GRB rate, and the nature of Type Ib/Ic supernovae. We briefly mention a
number of the physical models that have been proposed to explain XRFs. We then
consider two fundamentally different classes of phenomenological jet models:
universal jet models, in which it is posited that all GRBs jets are identical
and that differences in the observed properties of the bursts are due entirely
to differences in the viewing angle; and variable-opening angle jet models, in
which it is posited that GRB jets have a distribution of jet opening angles and
that differences in the observed properties of the bursts are due to
differences in the emissivity and spectra of jets having different opening
angles. We consider three shapes for the emissivity as a function of the
viewing angle theta_v from the axis of the jet: power-law, top hat (or
uniform), and Gaussian (or Fisher). We then discuss the effect of relativistic
beaming on each of these models. We show that observations can distinguish
between these various models.",2005-05-08T17:18:38Z
All Coronal Loops are the Same: Evidence to the Contrary,"The 1998 April 20 spectral line data from the Coronal Diagnostics
Spectrometer (CDS) on the {\it Solar and Heliospheric Observatory} (\SOHO)
shows a coronal loop on the solar limb. Our original analysis of these data
showed that the plasma was multi-thermal, both along the length of the loop and
along the line of sight. However, more recent results by other authors indicate
that background subtraction might change these conclusions, so we consider the
effect of background subtraction on our analysis. We show Emission Measure (EM)
Loci plots of three representative pixels: loop apex, upper leg, and lower leg.
Comparisons of the original and background-subtracted intensities show that the
EM Loci are more tightly clustered after background subtraction, but that the
plasma is still not well represented by an isothermal model. Our results taken
together with those of other authors indicate that a variety of temperature
structures may be present within loops.",2005-05-30T17:54:34Z
TeV Dark Matter detection by Atmospheric Cerenkov Telescopes,"Ground based Atmospheric Cerenkov Telescopes have recently unveiled a TeV
gamma-ray signal from the direction of the Galactic Centre. We examine whether
these gamma-rays, observed by the VERITAS, CANGAROO-II and HESS collaborations,
may arise from annihilations of dark matter particles. Emission from nearby
dwarf spheroidals, such as Sagittarius, could provide a test of this scenario.",2005-05-19T17:00:02Z
On the Dynamics of Suddenly Heated Accretion Disks around Neutron Stars,"Type I X-ray bursts and superbursts on neutron stars release sudden and
intense radiation fields into their surroundings. Here, we consider the
possible effects of these powerful explosions on the structure of the accretion
disk. The goal is to account for the apparent evolution of the innermost
regions of the accretion disk around 4U 1820-30 during a superburst. Three
different processes are considered in detail: radiatively or thermally driven
outflows, inflow due to Poynting-Robertson drag, and a structural change to the
disk by X-ray heating. Radiatively driven winds with large column densities can
be launched from the inner disk, but only for L/L_{Edd} >~ 1, which is expected
to be obtained only at the onset of the burst. Furthermore, the predicted mass
outflow rate is less than the accretion rate in 4U 1820-30. Estimates of the
Poynting-Robertson or radiative drag timescale shows that it is a very
efficient means of removing angular momentum from the gas. However, the
analytical results are likely only applicable at the innermost edge of the
disk. X-ray heating gives a change in the disk scale height that is correlated
with the blackbody temperature, as seen in the evolution during the 4U 1820-30
superburst. If this change in the scale height can alter the surface density,
then the viscous time (with \alpha ~ 0.03-0.2) is the closest match to the 4U
1820-30 results. We expect, however, that all three processes are likely
ongoing when an accretion disk is subject to a sudden heating event.
Ultimately, a numerical simulation of a disk around a bursting neutron star is
required to determine the exact response of the disk. Magnetic truncation of
the accretion flow is also considered and applied to the 4U 1820-30 X-ray
reflection results.",2005-02-22T17:13:47Z
Environmental Dependencies in the Luminosity Function of Galaxies,"The evidence is becoming strong that the luminosity function of galaxies
varies with environment. Higher density, more dynamically evolved regions
appear to have more dwarfs per giant. The situation is becoming clearer as a
result of wide field imaging surveys with the Canada-France-Hawaii and Subaru
telescopes and spectroscopy of faint dwarfs with the Keck telescope. We report
here on extensive observations of the small but dense NGC 5846 Group. The faint
end of the luminosity function rises relatively steeply in this case.",2005-05-03T04:36:52Z
On the nature of the X-ray source in GK Per,"We report XMM-Newton observations of the intermediate polar (IP) GK Per on
the rise to the 2002 outburst and compare them to Chandra observations during
quiescence. We find an asymmetric spin light curve implying an asymmetric shape
of a semi-transparent accretion curtain. A low Fe xvii (15.01/15.26 A) line
flux ratio confirms the need for an asymmetric geometry and significant effects
of resonant line scattering. Medium resolution spectra in outburst and
quiescence are both fitted with a leaky absorber model for the post shock hard
X-ray emission, a black body (outburst) for the thermalized X-ray emission from
the white dwarf and an optically thin spectrum. The difference between high and
low spin as well as QPO/flares states can be explained by a variation in the
absorbing column density. The Fe fluorescence at 6.4 keV (equivalent width of
447 eV) is not significantly variable during spin cycle or on QPO periods.
High-resolution RGS spectra reveal a number of emission lines from H-like and
He-like elements. The lines are broader than the instrumental response with a
roughly constant velocity dispersion for different lines, indicating identical
origin. He-like emission lines are used to give values for the electron
densities of log n_e ~ 12. We do not detect any variation in the emission lines
during the spin cycle, implying that the lines are not noticeably obscured or
absorbed. We conclude that they originate in the accretion curtains and propose
a model for their shape.",2005-05-04T12:41:16Z
A New Wolf-Rayet Star and its Ring Nebula: PCG11,"In a search for new Galactic planetary nebulae from our systematic scans of
the Anglo-Australian Observatory/United Kingdom Schmidt Telescope (AAO/UKST)
Halpha survey of the Southern Galactic Plane, we have identified a Pop I
Wolf-Rayet star of type WN7h associated with an unusual ring nebula that has a
fractured rim. We present imagery in Halpha, the 843-MHz continuum from the
Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST), the mid-infrared from the
Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX), and confirmatory optical spectroscopy of the
character of the nebula and of its central star. The inner edge of the Halpha
shell shows gravitational instabilities with a well-defined wavelength around
its complete circumference.",2005-04-22T05:27:20Z
HI shells in the outer Milky Way,"We present results of a method for an automatic search for HI shells in 3D
data cubes and apply it to the Leiden-Dwingeloo HI survey of the northern Milky
Way. In the 2nd Galactic quadrant, where identifications of structures are not
substantially influenced by overlapping, we find nearly 300 structures. The
Galactic distribution of shells has an exponential profile in the radial
direction with a scale length of 3 kpc. In the z direction, one half of the
shells are found at distances smaller than 500 pc. We also calculate the
energies necessary to create the shells: there are several structures with
energies greater than 10 E_SN but only one with an energy exceeding 100 E_SN.
Their size distribution, corrected for distance effects, is approximated by a
power-law with an index 2.1. Our identifications provide a lower limit to the
filling factor of shells in the outer Milky Way: f_2D = 0.4 and f_3D = 0.05.",2005-03-21T14:26:15Z
"Excitation Of MHD Modes With Gravitational Waves: A Testbed For
  Numerical Codes","We consider a gravitational wave oscillating in an initially homogeneous,
magnetized fluid. The fluid is perfectly conducting and isentropic, and the
magnetic field is initially uniform. We find analytic solutions for the case in
which the gravitational wave is linear and unaffected by the background fluid
and field. Our solutions show how gravitational waves can excite three
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes in the fluid: Alfven waves, and both fast and
slow magnetosonic waves. Our analytic solutions are particularly useful for
testing numerical codes designed to treat general relativistic MHD in dynamical
spacetimes, as we demonstrate in a companion paper.",2005-03-18T21:15:39Z
"A simple method to construct exact density-potential pairs from a
  homeoidal expansion","We start from a study of the density-potential relation for classical
homeoids in terms of an asymptotic expansion for small deviations from
spherical symmetry. We then show that such expansion is a useful device that
allows us to construct a variety of exact density-potential pairs with
spheroidal, toroidal, or triaxial shapes for which the deviation from spherical
symmetry is finite. As concrete analytical applications, we describe: (1) The
construction of a family of toroidal axisymmetric density-potential pairs one
of which is associated with a perfectly flat rotation curve (for a member of
this family, the supporting two-integral phase-space distribution function is
obtained in closed form); (2) The determination of the aperture velocity
dispersion in a wide class of two-integral axisymmetric models not stratified
on homeoids with central black hole, which may be useful for the discussion of
the dynamical contributions to the characteristics of the Fundamental Plane of
early-type galaxies; and (3) For such class of models, the construction of the
v/sigma-ellipticity relation, often considered to assess the role of rotation
in the structure of elliptical galaxies.",2005-04-04T11:59:22Z
Testing the Friedmannian magnitude-redshift relation with SNIa data,"Standard cosmology is constructed upon the (generally implicit) assumption of
the ``large scale'' homogeneity of our Universe. Now, structures are observed
at scales which become larger and larger as the observational distances
increase. However, the homogeneous Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker model
remains a cosmological paradigm, and Friedmannian relations are usually used to
work out the model, implicitly assuming that the homogeneity assumption is
valid at the studied scales. This has been the way the concordance (Lambda-CDM)
model came out from the analyses of the SNIa data. Since this model implies the
validity of the Friedmannian magnitude-redshift relation at the range of
redshifts spaned by the supernovae surveys, it has been proposed some years ago
a very simple test of this possible validity, provided the SNIa should be
confirmed as standard candles. Since we can hope that the redshifts of the
supernovae which will be observed in the years to come will allow such a test
to be performed, it would be interesting to find inside the SNIa community some
collaborators ready to perform the test.",2005-04-21T16:39:38Z
"From Young and Hot to Old and Cold: Comparing White Dwarf Cooling Theory
  to Main Sequence Stellar Evolution in Open Clusters","I explore the current ability of both white dwarf cooling theory and main
sequence stellar evolution theory to accurately determine stellar population
ages by comparing ages derived using both techniques for open clusters ranging
from 0.1 to 4 Gyr. I find good agreement between white dwarf and main sequence
evolutionary ages over the entire age range currently available for study. I
also find that directly comparing main sequence turn-off ages to white dwarf
ages is only weakly sensitive to realistic levels of errors in cluster
distance, metallicity, and reddening. Additional detailed comparisons between
white dwarf and main sequence ages have tremendous potential to refine and
calibrate both of these important clocks, and I present new simulations of
promising open cluster targets. The most demanding requirement for these white
dwarf studies are very deep (V > 25-28) cluster observations made necessary by
the faintness of the oldest white dwarfs.",2005-02-14T04:44:14Z
The distances of short-hard GRBs and the SGR connection,"We present a search for nearby (D<100 Mpc) galaxies in the error boxes of six
well-localized short-hard gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). None of the six error boxes
reveals the presence of a plausible nearby host galaxy. This allows us to set
lower limits on the distances and, hence, the isotropic-equivalent energy of
these GRBs. Our lower limits are around $1 \times 10^{49}$ erg (at $2\sigma$
confidence level); as a consequence, some of the short-hard GRBs we examine
would have been detected by BATSE out to distances greater than 1 Gpc and
therefore constitute a bona fide cosmological population. Our search is
partially motivated by the December 27, 2004 hypergiant flare from SGR 1806-20,
and the intriguing possibility that short-hard GRBs are extragalactic events of
a similar nature. Such events would be detectable with BATSE to a distance of
\~50 Mpc, and their detection rate should be comparable to the actual BATSE
detection rate of short-hard GRBs. The failure of our search, by contrast,
suggests that such flares constitute less than 15% of the short-hard GRBs (<40%
at 95% confidence). We discuss possible resolutions of this discrepancy.",2005-02-08T20:38:42Z
Statefinder diagnostic for coupled quintessence,"The problem of the cosmic coincidence is a longstanding puzzle. This
conundrum may be solved by introducing a coupling between the two dark sectors.
In this Letter, we study two cases of the coupled quintessence scenario. $(a)$
Assume that the mass of dark matter particles depends exponentially on the
scalar field associated to dark energy and meanwhile the scalar field evolves
in an exponential potential; $(b)$ Assume that the mass of dark matter
particles depends on a power law function of the scalar field and meanwhile the
scalar field evolves in a power law potential. Since the dynamics of this
system is dominated by an attractor solution, the mass of dark matter particles
is forced to change with time as to ensure that the ratio between the energy
densities of dark matter and dark energy becomes a constant at late times, and
one thus solve the cosmic coincidence problem naturally. We perform a
statefinder diagnostic to both cases of this coupled quintessence scenario. It
is shown that the evolving trajectory of this scenario in the $s-r$ diagram is
quite different from those of other dark energy models.",2005-03-03T15:08:52Z
Evidence for a Starburst within 9 pc of the Active Nucleus of NGC 1097,"We report evidence for a recent burst of star formation located within 9 pc
of the active nucleus of NGC 1097. The observational signatures of the
starburst include UV absorption lines and continuum emission from young stars
observed in a small-aperture HST spectrum. The burst is a few times 10^6 yr
old, has a mass of approximately 10^6 solar masses, an observed luminosity of
1.5 x 10^7 solar luminosities and is obscured by approximately 3 visual
magnitudes. The importance of this finding is two-fold: (1) the proximity of
the starburst to the active nucleus and thus possible association with it; (2)
its obscuration by and apparent association with a dusty absorbing medium,
while the broad emission lines appear unobscured, suggesting that the starburst
could be embedded in a circumnuclear torus as predicted in the Unified Model of
active galactic nuclei.",2005-03-28T13:58:45Z
"Vegetation's Red Edge: A Possible Spectroscopic Biosignature of
  Extraterrestrial Plants","Earth's deciduous plants have a sharp order-of-magnitude increase in leaf
reflectance between approximately 700 and 750 nm wavelength. This strong
reflectance of Earth's vegetation suggests that surface biosignatures with
sharp spectral features might be detectable in the spectrum of scattered light
from a spatially unresolved extrasolar terrestrial planet. We assess the
potential of Earth's step-function-like spectroscopic feature, referred to as
the ""red edge"", as a tool for astrobiology. We review the basic characteristics
and physical origin of the red edge and summarize its use in astronomy: early
spectroscopic efforts to search for vegetation on Mars and recent reports of
detection of the red edge in the spectrum of Earthshine (i.e., the spatially
integrated scattered light spectrum of Earth). We present Earthshine
observations from Apache Point Observatory to emphasize that time variability
is key to detecting weak surface biosignatures such as the vegetation red edge.
We briefly discuss the evolutionary advantages of vegetation's red edge
reflectance, and speculate that while extraterrestrial ""light harvesting
organisms"" have no compelling reason to display the exact same red edge feature
as terrestrial vegetation, they might have similar spectroscopic features at
different wavelengths than terrestrial vegetation. This implies that future
terrestrial-planet-characterizing space missions should obtain data that allow
time-varying, sharp spectral features at unknown wavelengths to be identified.
We caution that some mineral reflectance edges are similar in slope and
strength to vegetation's red edge (albeit at different wavelengths); if an
extrasolar planet reflectance edge is detected care must be taken with its
interpretation.",2005-03-14T21:22:22Z
XMM-Newton and VLT observations of the afterglow of GRB040827,"The field of the Gamma-Ray Burst GRB 040827 was observed with XMM-Newton and
with the ESO/VLT starting ~6 and ~12 hours after the burst, respectively. A
fading X-ray afterglow is clearly detected with the XMM-Newton/EPIC instrument,
with a time decay t^(-delta), with delta=1.41+/-0.10. Its spectrum is well
described by a power law (photon index Gamma=2.3+/-0.1) affected by an
absorption largely exceeding (by a factor ~5) the expected Galactic one,
requiring the contribution of an intrinsic, redshifted absorber. In the
optical/NIR range, the afterglow emission was observed in the Ks band, as a
weak source superimposed to the host galaxy, with magnitude Ks=19.44+/-0.13 (12
hours after the GRB, contribution from the host subtracted); in other bands the
flux is dominated by the host galaxy. Coupling constraints derived from X-ray
spectral fitting and from photometry of the host, we estimated a gas column
density in the range (0.4-2.6)x10^22 cm^-2 in the GRB host galaxy, likely
located at a redshift 0.5<z<1.7. GRB 040827 stands out as the best example of
an X-ray afterglow with intrinsic absorption.",2005-05-12T15:54:13Z
X-ray Outburst in Mira A,"We report here the Chandra ACIS-S detection of a bright soft X-ray transient
in the Mira AB interacting symbiotic-like binary. We resolved the system for
the first time in the X-rays. Using Chandra and HST images we determined that
the unprecedented outburst is likely associated with the cool AGB star (Mira
A), the prototype of Mira-type variables. X-rays have never before been
detected from an AGB star, and the recent activity signals that the system is
undergoing dramatic changes. The total X-ray luminosity of the system is
several times higher than the luminosity estimated using previous XMM and ROSAT
observations. The outburst may be caused by a giant flare in Mira A associated
with a mass ejection or a jet, and may have long term consequences on the
system.",2005-03-02T20:08:04Z
Einstein-de Sitter model re-examined for the newly discovered SNe Ia,"Consistency of Einstein-de Sitter model with the recently observed SNe Ia by
the Hubble Space Telescope is examined. The model shows a reasonable fit to the
observation, if one takes into account the extinction of SNe light by the
intergalactic metallic dust ejected from the SNe explosions. Though the fit to
the new data is worsened considerably compared with the earlier data, it can
still be regarded acceptable. We should wait for more accurate observations at
higher redshifts (as expected from the coming space missions such as SNAP and
JWST) in order to rule out a model, which seems to explain all the other
existing observations well (some even better than the favoured $\Lambda$CDM
model), is consistent with beautiful theoretical ideas like inflation and cold
dark matter, and is not as speculative as the models of dark energy.",2005-06-09T20:00:56Z
Unstable quasi g-modes in rotating main-sequence stars,"This paper studies the oscillatory stability of uniformly rotating
main-sequence stars of mass 3-8 M_sun by solving the linearized non-adiabatic,
non-radial oscillation equations with a forcing term and searching for resonant
response to a complex forcing frequency. By using the traditional approximation
the solution of the forced oscillation equations becomes separable, whereby the
energy equation is made separable by approximation. It is found that the
kappa-mechanism in rotating B-stars can destabilize not only gravity- or
pressure modes, but also a branch of low frequency retrograde (in corotating
frame) oscillations in between the retrograde g-modes and toroidal r-modes.
These unstable quasi g-modes (or `q-modes') hardly exhibit rotational
confinement to the equatorial regions of the star, while the oscillations are
always prograde in the observer's frame, all in contrast to g-modes. The
unstable q-modes occur in a few narrow period bands (defined by their azimuthal
index m), and seem to fit the oscillation spectra observed in SPB stars rather
well. The unstable q-mode oscillation spectrum of a very rapidly rotating 8
M_sun star appears similar to that of the well studied Be-star mu Cen. The
unstable q-modes thus seem far better in explaining the observed oscillation
spectra in SPB-stars and Be-stars than normal g-modes.",2005-06-07T21:18:13Z
"The 2dF-SDSS LRG and QSO Survey: The z<2.1 Quasar Luminosity Function
  from 5645 Quasars to g=21.85","We have used the 2dF instrument on the AAT to obtain redshifts of a sample of
z<3, 18.0<g<21.85 quasars selected from SDSS imaging. These data are part of a
larger joint programme: the 2dF-SDSS LRG and QSO Survey (2SLAQ). We describe
the quasar selection algorithm and present the resulting luminosity function of
5645 quasars in 105.7 deg^2. The bright end number counts and luminosity
function agree well with determinations from the 2dF QSO Redshift Survey (2QZ)
data to g\sim20.2. However, at the faint end the 2SLAQ number counts and
luminosity function are steeper than the final 2QZ results from Croom et al.
(2004), but are consistent with the preliminary 2QZ results from Boyle et al.
(2000). Using the functional form adopted for the 2QZ analysis, we find a faint
end slope of beta=-1.78+/-0.03 if we allow all of the parameters to vary and
beta=-1.45+/-0.03 if we allow only the faint end slope and normalization to
vary. Our maximum likelihood fit to the data yields 32% more quasars than the
final 2QZ parameterization, but is not inconsistent with other g>21 deep
surveys. The 2SLAQ data exhibit no well defined ``break'' but do clearly
flatten with increasing magnitude. The shape of the quasar luminosity function
derived from 2SLAQ is in good agreement with that derived from type I quasars
found in hard X-ray surveys. [Abridged]",2005-04-13T17:01:38Z
"Amplification of Interstellar Magnetic Fields and Turbulent Mixing by
  Supernova-Driven Turbulence Part II - The Role of Dynamical Chaos","In this paper we further advance the study of magnetic field amplification in
the interstellar medium that was started in Balsara et al (2004, Paper I). We
show that the flux growth rate is comparable to the rate of magnetic energy
growth found in Paper I. We also demonstrate the role of intermittency in field
amplification. The density shows a double-peaked PDF, consistent with the
cooling curve that was used. The PDF of the magnetic field shows a high-end
tail, providing a tell-tale signature of the operation of the small scale
dynamo. The magnetic field strength correlates positively with the density. As
a result, the field amplification takes place more vigorously in the lower
temperature, denser gas. The Lagrangian chaos in the simulated turbulent flows
is studied in substantial detail. It is shown that the stretching rate of
material lines as well as the Lyapunov exponents can be used to gain important
insights into the growth of magnetic field. The cancellation exponent for the
small scale supernova-driven dynamo is derived and it is shown that
constructive folding of field lines in the dynamo is very inefficient. We also
show that our Lagrangian approach can yield actual measures of the turbulent
diffusivity in the simulated ISM. The turbulent diffusivity provides insights
into the mixing of elements from supernova ejecta on macroscopic scales. The
high rates of line stretching in interstellar turbulence suggests that the
eventual diffusion of elements at the molecular level is very efficient. Many
of the diagnostics of turbulence that are presented here can be used to make
direct connections between simulations and observations.",2005-04-04T13:08:50Z
The H I opacity of the intergalactic medium at redshifts 1.6 < z < 3.2,"We use high quality echelle spectra of 24 QSOs to provide a calibrated
measurement of the total amount of Lyman-alpha forest absorption (DA) over the
redshift range 2.2 < z < 3.2. Our measurement of DA excludes absorption from
metal lines or the Lyman-alpha lines of Lyman limit systems and damped
Lyman-alpha systems. We use artificial spectra with realistic flux calibration
errors to show that we are able to place continuum levels that are accurate to
better than 1%. When we combine our results with our previous results between
1.6 < z < 2.2, we find that the redshift evolution of DA is well described over
1.6 < z < 3.2 as A*(1+z)^gamma, where A = 0.0062 and gamma = 2.75. We detect no
significant deviations from a smooth power law evolution over the redshift
range studied. We find less H I absorption than expected at z=3, implying that
the UV background is about 40% higher than expected. Our data appears to be
consistent with an H I ionization rate of Gamma ~ 1.4E-12 1/s.",2005-04-18T17:14:46Z
Direct detection of exo-planets: GQ Lupi,"We present a comparison of our VLT/NACO K-band spectrum of the GQ Lupi
companion with the new GAIA-dusty model atmosphere grid for T=2000 and 2900 K
and log g from 0 to 4. Then, we discuss the mass estimate for GQ Lup companion.",2005-06-01T08:45:17Z
"HST/FOS Time-resolved spectral mapping of IP Pegasi at the end of an
  outburst","We report an eclipse mapping analysis of time-resolved ultraviolet
spectroscopy covering three eclipses of the dwarf nova IP Pegasi on the late
decline of the 1993 May outburst. The eclipse maps of the first run show
evidence of one spiral arm, suggesting that spiral structures may still be
present in the accretion disc 9 days after the onset of the outburst. In the
spatially resolved spectra the most prominent lines appear in emission at any
radius, being stronger in the inner disc regions. The spectrum of the gas
stream is clearly distinct from the disc spectrum in the intermediate and outer
disc regions, suggesting the occurrence of gas stream overflow. The full width
half maximum of C IV is approximately constant with radius, in contrast to the
expected $v\propto{R^{-1/2}}$ law for a gas in Keplerian orbits. This line
probably originates in a vertically extended region (chromosphere + disc wind).
The uneclipsed component contributes $\sim{4}$ % of the flux in C IV in the
first run, and becomes negligible in the remaining runs. We fit stellar
atmosphere models to the spatially resolved spectra. The radial run of the disc
color temperature for the three runs is flatter than the expected
$T\propto{R^{-3/4}}$ law for steady-state optically thick discs models, with
$T\simeq{20000}$ K in the inner regions and $T\simeq{9000}$ K in the outer disc
regions. The solid angles that result from the fits are smaller than expected
from the parameters of the system. The radial run of the solid angle suggests
that the disc is flared in outburst, and decreases in thickness toward the end
of the outburst.",2005-02-03T16:45:03Z
The density structure around quasars from optical depth statistics,"We present a method for studying the proximity effect and the density
structure around redshift z=2-3 quasars. It is based on the probability
distribution of Lyman-alpha pixel optical depths and its evolution with
redshift.
  We validate the method using mock spectra obtained from hydrodynamical
simulations, and then apply it to a sample of 12 bright quasars at redshifts
2-3 observed with UVES at the VLT-UT2 Kueyen ESO telescope. These quasars do
not show signatures of associated absorption and have a mean monochromatic
luminosity of 5.4 10^{31} h^{-2} erg/s/Hz at the Lyman limit. The observed
distribution of optical depth within 10 Mpc/h from the QSO is statistically
different from that measured in the general intergalactic medium at the same
redshift. Such a change will result from the combined effects of the increase
in photoionisation rate above the mean UV-background due to the extra ionizing
photons from the quasar radiation (proximity effect), and the higher density of
the IGM if the quasars reside in overdense regions (as expected from biased
galaxy formation). The first factor decreases the optical depth whereas the
second one increases the optical depth, but our measurement cannot distinguish
a high background from a low overdensity. An overdensity of the order of a few
is required if we use the amplitude of the UV-background inferred from the mean
Lyman-$\alpha$ opacity. If no overdensity is present, then we require the
UV-background to be higher, and consistent with the existing measurements based
on standard analysis of the proximity effect.",2005-02-15T06:31:54Z
"The fingerprint of binary intermediate mass black holes in globular
  clusters: supra-thermal stars and angular momentum alignment","We explore the signatures that a binary intermediate mass black hole (IMBH)
imprints on the velocity and on the angular momentum of globular cluster stars.
Simulating 3-body encounters between a star and a binary IMBH, we find that the
binary IMBH generates a family of few hundreds of stars (~100-300) which remain
bound to the globular cluster (GC) and have velocity significantly higher than
the dispersion velocity. For this reason we term them ''supra-thermal'' stars.
We also notice that, after the interaction, a considerable fraction (55-70%) of
stars tend to align their orbital angular momentum with the angular momentum of
the binary IMBH, introducing an anisotropy in the angular momentum distribution
of cluster stars. We simulate the dynamical evolution of these supra-thermal
stars before thermalization, and find that these stars tend to cluster at a
distance of few core radii from the GC center. We conclude that the
detectability of such signatures appears problematic with present telescopes.",2005-06-17T07:03:59Z
Giant Planet Companion to 2MASSW J1207334-393254,"We report new VLT/NACO imaging observations of the young, nearby brown dwarf
2MASSW J1207334-393254 and its suggested planetary mass companion (2M1207 b).
Three epochs of VLT/NACO measurements obtained over nearly one year show that
the planetary mass companion candidate shares the same proper motion and, with
a high confidence level, is not a stationary background object. This result
confirms the status of 2M1207 b as of planetary mass (5 times the mass of
Jupiter) and the first image of a planetary mass companion in a different
system than our own. This discovery offers new perspectives for our
understanding of chemical and physical properties of planetary mass objects as
well as their mechanisms of formation.",2005-04-29T11:23:38Z
"Dynamical and chemical properties of the ""starless"" core L1014","Spitzer Space Telescope observations of a point-like source, L1014-IRS, close
to the dust peak of the low-mass dense core L1014 have questioned its starless
nature. The presence of an object with colors expected for an embedded
protostar makes L1014-IRS the lowest luminosity isolated protostar known, and
an ideal target with which to test star formation theories at the low mass end.
In order to study its molecular content and to search for the presence of a
molecular outflow, we mapped L1014 in at least one transition of 12CO, N2H+,
HCO+, CS and of their isotopologues 13CO, C18O, C17O, N2D+ and H13CO+, using
the FCRAO, the IRAM 30 meter and the CSO. The data show physical and chemical
properties in L1014 typical of the less evolved starless cores: i.e. H2 central
density of a few 10^5 molecules cm^-3, estimated mass of ~2M_sun, CO integrated
depletion factor less than 10, N(N2H+)~6*10^12 cm^-2, N(N2D+)/N(N2H+) equal to
10% and relatively broad N2H+(1--0) lines (0.35 km/s). Infall signatures and
significant velocity shifts between optically thick and optically thin tracers
are not observed in the line profiles. No classical signatures of molecular
outflow are found in the 12CO and 13CO observations. In particular, no high
velocity wings are found, and no well-defined blue-red lobes of 12CO emission
are seen in the channel maps. If sensitive, higher resolution observations
confirm the absence of an outflow on a smaller scale than probed by our
observations, L1014-IRS would be the only protostellar object known to be
formed without driving an outflow.",2005-02-04T10:16:48Z
"Radio Observations of the Hubble Deep Field South region: I. Survey
  Description and Initial Results","This paper is the first of a series describing the results of the Australia
Telescope Hubble Deep Field South (ATHDFS) radio survey. The survey was
conducted at four wavelengths - 20, 11, 6, and 3 cm, over a 4-year period, and
achieves an rms sensitivity of about 10 microJy at each wavelength. We describe
the observations and data reduction processes, and present data on radio
sources close to the centre of the HDF-S. We discuss in detail the properties
of a subset of these sources. The sources include both starburst galaxies and
galaxies powered by an active galactic nucleus, and range in redshift from 0.1
to 2.2. Some of them are characterised by unusually high radio-to-optical
luminosities, presumably caused by dust extinction.",2005-05-11T03:02:30Z
"Spatially Resolved STIS Spectra of Betelgeuse's Upper Chromosphere and
  Circumstellar Dust Envelope","The Hubble Space Telescope observed red supergiant Betelgeuse with the Space
Telescope Imaging Spectrograph to investigate the outer atmosphere from
spatially resolved spectra. We present a new set of seven high-resolution
near-UV spectra observed with HST-STIS in fall 2002 and spring 2003, by
scanning at chromospheric intensity peak-up position and six off-limb target
positions up to three arcseconds away from the star. A small aperture is used
to study and determine the thermal conditions and flow dynamics in its upper
chromosphere and inner circumstellar dust envelope. We provide the first
evidence for the presence of warm chromospheric plasma at least 3 arcseconds
away from Betelgeuse at ~120 R* (1 R* ~= 700 Rsun) based on detailed
spectroscopic observations of the Mg II h & k emission lines. Many other weak
chromospheric emission lines as Fe II lam2716, C II lam2327, Al II] lam2669,
and Fe I lam2823 are detected out to at least 1 arcsecond in the spatially
resolved STIS observations. The profiles of the Mg II h & k and the Si I
resonance emission lines reveal a strong increase of asymmetry by scanning
off-limb, signaling the outward acceleration of wind expansion in Betelgeuse's
upper chromosphere beyond 200 mas (~8 R*). We discuss detailed radiative
transfer models that fit the STIS observations showing that the local kinetic
gas temperature in the upper chromosphere exceeds 2600 K. Our radiation
transport models for the IR silicate dust emission at 9.8 um in the upper
chromosphere show however that the ambient gas temperature remains below 600 K
to sustain the presence of dust grains. Hence, the STIS spectra of Betelgeuse's
upper chromosphere directly demonstrate that warm chromospheric plasma must
co-exist with cool dusty plasma in its outer atmosphere.",2005-04-23T23:46:11Z
"Constraining population synthesis models via the binary neutron star
  population","The observed sample of double neutron-star (NS-NS) binaries presents a
challenge to population-synthesis models of compact object formation: the
parameters entering into these models must be carefully chosen so as to match
(i) the observed star formation rate and (ii) the formation rate of NS-NS
binaries, which can be estimated from the observed sample and the selection
effects related to the discoveries with radio-pulsar surveys. In this paper, we
select from an extremely broad family of possible population synthesis models
those few (2%) which are consistent with the observed sample of NS-NS binaries.
To further sharpen the constraints the observed NS-NS population places upon
our understanding of compact-object formation processes, we separate the
observed NS-NS population into two channels: (i) merging NS-NS binaries, which
will inspiral and merge through the action of gravitational waves within $10 $
Gyr, and (ii) wide NS-NS binaries, consisting of all the rest. With the subset
of astrophysically consistent models, we explore the implications for the rates
at which double black hole (BH-BH), black hole-neutron star (BH-NS), and NS-NS
binaries will merge through the emission of gravitational waves.",2005-04-21T17:29:34Z
"Neutrino emission in the hadronic Synchrotron Mirror Model: the ""orphan""
  TeV flare from 1ES 1959+650","A challenge to standard leptonic SSC models are so-called orphan TeV flares,
i.e. enhanced very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission without any
contemporaneous X-ray flaring activity, that have recently been observed in
TeV-blazars (e.g., 1ES 1959+650). In order to explain the orphan TeV flare of
1ES 1959+650 observed in June 2002, the co-called hadronic synchrotron mirror
model has been developed. Here, relativistic protons are proposed to exist in
the jet, and interact with reflected electron-synchrotron radiation of the
precursor SSC flare. If the reflector is located in the cloud region, time
shifts of several days are possible between the precursor and the orphan flare.
The external photons, blueshifted in the comoving jet frame, are able to excite
the \Delta(1232)-resonance when interacting with protons of Lorentz factors
\gamma'_p~10^3-10^4. The decay products of this resonance include charged pions
which, upon decay, give rise to neutrino production during the orphan flare. In
this paper we calculate the expected neutrino emission for the June 4, 2002,
orphan TeV flare of 1ES 1959+650. We compare our results with the recent
observations of AMANDA-II of a neutrino event in spatial and temporal
coincidence with the orphan flare of this blazar. We find that the expected
neutrino signal from the hadronic synchrotron mirror model is insufficient to
explain the observed neutrino event from the direction of 1ES 1959+650.",2005-05-11T16:02:23Z
An X-ray Transient and Optical Counterpart in the M31 Bulge,"We have obtained snapshot images of a transient X-ray source in M31 from
Chandra ACIS-I and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys
(ACS). The Chandra position of the X-ray nova was R.A.=00:42:56.038 +/-0.08'',
Dec.=+41:12:18.50 +/-0.07''. The transient was active for at least 6 months.
Previous observations set an upper limit before the X-ray outburst,
demonstrating variability by a factor of >100 and confirming the transient
nature of the source. For the first 6 months after the initial detection, the
X-ray luminosity was ~6 X 10$^{37}$ erg/s; it then decayed to <5 X 10$^{36}$
erg/s over the following 2 months. An HST observation 29 days after the initial
X-ray detection revealed a source at R.A.=00:42:56.042, Dec.=+41:12:18.45 that
was B=24.52 +/- 0.07. This optical source faded to B=24.95 +/- 0.08$ in 9
months. The HST identification of an optical source at the same position as the
X-ray source, fading in concert with the X-ray source, indicates that this
optical source is the counterpart of the X-ray transient. The lack of high-mass
stars in the region suggests this source is a low-mass X-ray binary, and the
X-ray and optical luminosities provide a rough orbital period estimate of
8$^{+12}_{-5}$ days for the system.",2005-04-11T20:27:24Z
"INTEGRAL and XMM-Newton observations of the low-luminosity and X-ray
  rich burst GRB 040223","GRB 040223 was observed by INTEGRAL and XMM-Newton. GRB 040223 has a peak
flux of (1.6+/-0.13) x10^-8 ergs cm^-2 s^-1, a fluence of (4.4+/-0.4)x10^-7
ergs cm^-2 and a steep photon power law index of -2.3+/-0.2, in the energy
range 20-200 keV. The steep spectrum implies it is an x- ray rich GRB with
emission up to 200 keV and E_peak < 20 keV. If E_peak is < 10 keV, it would
qualify as an x-ray flash with high energy emission. The x-ray data has a
spectral index beta_x = -1.7+/-0.2, a temporal decay of t^(-0.75+/-0.25) and a
large column density of (1.8 x 10^22) cm^-2. The luminosity-lag relationship
was used to obtain a redshift (z = 0.1+0.04-0.02). The isotropic energy
radiated in gamma-rays and x-ray luminosity after 10 hours are factors of 1000
and 100 less than classical GRBs. GRB 040223 is consistent with the
extrapolation of the Amati relation into the region that includes XRF 030723
and XRF 020903.",2005-05-17T17:51:48Z
"Kinematics of the Galactic Halo from Horizontal Branch stars in the
  Hamburg/ESO Survey","Large samples of Field Horizontal Branch (FHB) stars make excellent tracers
of the Galactic halo; by studying their kinematics, one can infer important
physical properties of our Galaxy. Here we present the results of a
medium-resolution spectroscopic survey of 530 FHB stars selected from the
Hamburg/ESO survey. The stars have a mean distance of ~7 kpc and thus probe the
inner parts of the Milky Way halo. We measure radial velocities from the
spectra in order to test the model of Sommer-Larsen et al., who suggested that
the velocity ellipsoid of the halo changes from radially-dominated orbits to
tangentially-dominated orbits as one proceeds from the inner to the outer halo.
We find that the present data are unable to discriminate between this model and
a more simple isothermal ellipsoid; we suggest that additional observations
towards the Galactic centre might help to differentiate them.",2005-04-04T04:32:59Z
"The FUSE Spectrum of the Planetary Nebula SwSt 1: Evidence for
  Inhomogeneities in the Gas and Dust","[Abridged] We present Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE)
observations of the young, compact planetary nebula (PN) SwSt 1 along the line
of sight to its central star HD 167362. We detect circumstellar absorption
lines from several species against the continuum of the central star. The
physical parameters of the nebula derived from the FUSE data differ
significantly from those found from emission lines. We derive an electron
density n_e = 8800^{+4800}_{-2400} cm^{-3} from the column density ratio of the
excited S III fine structure levels, which is at least a factor of 3 lower than
all prior estimates. The gaseous iron abundance derived from the UV lines is
quite high ([Fe/S] = -0.35+/-0.12), which implies that iron is not
significantly depleted into dust. In contrast, optical and near-infrared
emission lines indicate that Fe is more strongly depleted: [Fe/H] =
-1.64+/-0.24 and [Fe/S] = -1.15+/-0.33. We do not detect nebular H_2
absorption, to a limit N(H_2) < 7\times10^14 cm^{-2}, at least four orders of
magnitude lower than the column density estimated from infrared H_2 emission
lines. Taken together, the lack of H_2 absorption, low n_e, and high gaseous Fe
abundance derived from the FUSE spectrum provide strong evidence that dense
structures (which can shield molecules and dust from the destructive effects of
energetic stellar photons) are not present along the line of sight to the
central star. On the other hand, there is substantial evidence for dust,
molecular material, and dense gas elsewhere in SwSt 1. Therefore, we conclude
that the nebula must have an inhomogeneous structure.",2005-02-16T16:42:29Z
Probing the Local Group Medium Toward Mkn 421 with Chandra and FUSE,"We report the detection of highly-ionized gas at z~0 seen in resonant UV and
X-ray absorption lines toward the z=0.03 blazar Mkn 421. A total of 13 X-ray
and 3 UV lines were measured (or upper limits derived), including three lines
in the OVII K-series and K\alpha transitions from neon, carbon, and nitrogen.
  From the three OVII lines we derive a 2\sigma Doppler parameter constraint of
24<b<55 km/s. The FUSE spectrum shows strong Galactic low--velocity OVI 1032A
absorption as well as a possible weak OVI high-velocity component (HVC). The
Doppler parameter of the low-velocity OVI measured with FUSE is ~3\sigma higher
than that derived from the OVII line ratios, indicating that the OVII and
Galactic OVI arise in different phases. This velocity dispersion, along with
limits on the gas temperature and density from the X-ray line ratios (assuming
a single phase with collisional ionization equilibrium plus photoionization)
are all consistent with an extragalactic absorber. However, the OVII Doppler
parameter is inconsistent with the high temperature required to produce the
observed OVI_HVC/OVII ratio, implying that the HVC is probably not related to
the OVII. In addition, the OVI_K\alpha line detected by Chandra implies a
column density ~4 times higher than the 1032A absorption. Although an
extragalactic absorber is fully consistent with the measured column density
ratios, a Galactic origin cannot be ruled out given the uncertainties in the
available data.",2005-04-26T15:20:07Z
Very High Energy Cosmic Rays and Their Interactions,"The investigation of high energy cosmic rays and their interactions is a very

An upper limit to [C II] emission in a z ~= 5 galaxy,"Low-ionization-state far-infrared (FIR) emission lines may be useful
diagnostics of star-formation activity in young galaxies, and at high redshift
may be detectable from the ground. In practice, however, very little is known
concerning how strong such line emission might be in the early Universe. We
attempted to detect the 158 micron [C II] line from a lensed galaxy at z =
4.926 using the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory. This source is an ordinary
galaxy, in the sense that it shows high but not extreme star formation, but
lensing makes it visible. Our analysis includes a careful consideration of the
calibrations and weighting of the individual scans. We find only modest
improvement over the simpler reduction methods, however, and the final spectrum
remains dominated by systematic baseline ripple effects. We obtain a 95 per
cent confidence upper limit of 33 mJy for a 200 km/s full width at half maximum
line, corresponding to an unlensed luminosity of 1x10^9 L_sun for a standard
cosmology. Combining this with a marginal detection of the continuum emission
using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, we derive an upper limit of 0.4 per
cent for the ratio of L_CII/L_FIR in this object.",2005-03-02T21:08:47Z
"Winds, B-Fields, and Magnetotails of Pulsars","We investigate the emission of rotating magnetized neutron stars due to the
acceleration and radiation of particles in the relativistic wind and in the
magnetotail of the star. We consider that the charged particles are accelerated
by driven collisionless reconnection. Outside of the light cylinder, the star's
rotation acts to wind up the magnetic field to form a predominantly azimuthal,
slowly decreasing with distance, magnetic field of opposite polarity on either
side of the equatorial plane normal to the star's rotation axis. The magnetic
field annihilates across the equatorial plane with the magnetic energy going to
accelerate the charged particles to relativistic energies. For a typical
supersonically moving pulsar, the star's wind extends outward to the standoff
distance with the interstellar medium. At larger distances, the power output of
pulsar's wind $\dot{E}_w$ of electromagnetic field and relativistic particles
is {\it redirected and collimated into the magnetotail} of the star. In the
magnetotail it is proposed that equipartition is reached between the magnetic
energy and the relativistic particle energy. For such conditions, synchrotron
radiation from the magnetotails may be a significant fraction of $\dot{E}_w$
for high velocity pulsars. An equation is derived for the radius of the
magnetotail $r_m(z^\prime)$ as a function of distance $z^\prime$ from the star.
For large distances $z^\prime$, of the order of the distance travelled by the
star, we argue that the magnetotail has a `trumpet' shape owing to the slowing
down of the magnetotail flow.",2005-05-13T19:28:11Z
Non-equilibrium beta processes in superfluid neutron star cores,"The influence of nucleons superfluidity on the beta relaxation time of
degenerate neutron star cores, composed of neutrons, protons and electrons, is
investigated. We numerically calculate the implied reduction factors for both
direct and modified Urca reactions, with isotropic pairing of protons or
anisotropic pairing of neutrons. We find that due to the non-zero value of the
temperature and/or to the vanishing of anisotropic gaps in some directions of
the phase-space, superfluidity does not always completely inhibit beta
relaxation, allowing for some reactions if the superfluid gap amplitude is not
too large in respect to both the typical thermal energy and the chemical
potential mismatch. We even observe that if the ratio between the critical
temperature and the actual temperature is very small, a suprathermal regime is
reached for which superfluidity is almost irrelevant. On the contrary, if the
gap is large enough, the composition of the nuclear matter can stay frozen for
very long durations, unless the departure from beta equilibrium is at least as
important as the gap amplitude. These results are crucial for precise
estimation of the superfluidity effect on the cooling/slowing-down of pulsars
and we provide online subroutines to be implemented in codes for simulating
such evolutions.",2005-04-26T11:43:41Z
"Systematic uncertainties in the analysis of star cluster parameters
  based on broad-band imaging observations","(ABRIDGED) We assess the systematic uncertainties in (young) cluster age,
mass, and - to a lesser extent - extinction and metallicity determinations,
based on broad-band imaging observations with the Hubble Space Telescope. Our
aim here is to intercompare the results obtained using a variety of commonly
used modelling techniques, specifically with respect to our own extensively
tested multi-dimensional approach. Any significant differences among the
resulting parameters are due to the details of the various, independently
developed modelling techniques used, rather than to the stellar population
models themselves. Despite the model uncertainties and the selection effects
inherent to most methods used, we find that the PEAKS in the relative age and
mass distributions of a given young (<= 10^9 yr) cluster system can be derived
relatively robustly and consistently, to accuracies of sigma_t = Delta <log(Age
/ yr)> <= 0.35 and sigma_M = Delta <log(M_cl / Msun)> <= 0.14, respectively,
assuming Gaussian distributions in cluster ages and masses for reasons of
simplicity. The peaks in the relative mass distributions can be obtained with a
higher degree of confidence than those in the relative age distributions, as
exemplified by the smaller spread among the peak values of the mass
distributions derived. This implies that mass determinations are mostly
insensitive to the approach adopted. We reiterate that as extensive a
wavelength coverage as possible is required to obtain robust and internally
consistent age and mass estimates for the individual objects, with reasonable
uncertainties. Finally, we conclude that the ACTUAL filter systems used for the
observations should be used for constructing model colours, instead of using
conversion equations, to achieve more accurate derivations of ages and masses.",2005-02-15T11:30:26Z
Is the emerging massive cluster NGC 2244 a twin cluster?,"We present in this paper the first near infrared study of the young open
cluster NGC 2244, which is well known for its partially embedded nature in the
Rosette Nebula. Based on the spatially complete 2 Micron All Sky Survey, the
young OB cluster indicates apparent substructures. It is surprisingly resolved
into a compact core that matches well the congregation of massive OB stars in
the optical, a satellite cluster at a distance of 6.6 pc in its west and
probably a major stellar aggregate resembling an arc in structure right below
the core. This infrared study provides various new updates on its nature of the
young open cluster, including its central position, physical scale and stellar
population. A disk fraction of $\sim 20.5\pm2.8%$ is achieved for its members
with masses above 0.8 $M_{\odot}$. NGC 2244 is hence a unique example for the
study of embedded clusters.",2005-04-01T03:46:11Z
"Galaxy Luminosity Functions to z~1: DEEP2 vs. COMBO-17 and Implications
  for Red Galaxy Formation","The DEEP2 and COMBO-17 surveys are used to study the evolution of the
luminosity function of red and blue galaxies to $z \sim 1$. Schechter function
fits show that, since $z = 1$, $M^*_B$ dims by $\sim$ 1.3 mag per unit redshift
for both color classes, $\phi^*$ of blue galaxies shows little change, while
$\phi^*$ for red galaxies has formally nearly quadrupled. At face value, the
number density of blue galaxies has remained roughly constant since $ z = 1$,
whereas that of red galaxies has been rising. Luminosity densities support both
conclusions, but we note that most red-galaxy evolution occurs between our data
and local surveys and in our highest redshift bin, where the data are weakest.
We discuss the implications of having most red galaxies emerge after $z = 1$
from precursors among the blue population, taking into account the properties
of local and distant E/S0s. We suggest a ``mixed'' scenario in which some blue
galaxies have their star-formation quenched in gas-rich mergers, migrate to the
red sequence with a variety of masses, and merge further on the red sequence in
one or more purely stellar mergers. E/S0s of a given mass today will have
formed via different routes, in a manner that may help to explain the
fundamental plane and other local scaling laws.",2005-06-02T03:05:22Z
Report by the ESA-ESO Working Group on Extra-Solar Planets,"Various techniques are being used to search for extra-solar planetary
signatures, including accurate measurement of radial velocity and positional
(astrometric) displacements, gravitational microlensing, and photometric
transits. Planned space experiments promise a considerable increase in the
detections and statistical knowledge arising especially from transit and
astrometric measurements over the years 2005-15, with some hundreds of
terrestrial-type planets expected from transit measurements, and many thousands
of Jupiter-mass planets expected from astrometric measurements.
  Beyond 2015, very ambitious space (Darwin/TPF) and ground (OWL) experiments
are targeting direct detection of nearby Earth-mass planets in the habitable
zone and the measurement of their spectral characteristics. Beyond these, `Life
Finder' (aiming to produce confirmatory evidence of the presence of life) and
`Earth Imager' (some massive interferometric array providing resolved images of
a distant Earth) appear as distant visions.
  This report, to ESA and ESO, summarises the direction of exo-planet research
that can be expected over the next 10 years or so, identifies the roles of the
major facilities of the two organisations in the field, and concludes with some
recommendations which may assist development of the field.

the period June-December 2004.",2005-06-08T08:57:18Z
An upper limit to the masses of stars,"There is no accepted upper mass limit for stars. Such a basic quantity
escapes both theory, because of incomplete understanding of star formation, and
observation, because of incompleteness in surveying the Galaxy. The Arches
cluster is ideal for such a test, being massive enough to expect stars at least
as massive as 400 solar masses, and young enough for its most massive members
to still be visible. It is old enough to be free of its natal molecular cloud,
and close enough, and at a well-established distance, for us to discern its
individual stars. Here I report an absence of stars with initial masses greater
than 130 M_Sun in the Arches cluster, where the typical mass function predicts
18. I conclude that this indicates a firm limit of 150 M_Sun for stars as the
probability that the observations are consistent with no limit is 10^-8.",2005-03-08T20:10:02Z
HST Observations of Heavy Elements in Metal-Poor Galactic Halo Stars,"We present new abundance determinations of neutron-capture elements Ge, Zr,
Os, Ir, and Pt in a sample of 11 metal-poor (-3.1 <= [Fe/H] <= -1.6) Galactic
halo giant stars, based on Hubble Space Telescope UV and Keck I optical
high-resolution spectroscopy. The stellar sample is dominated by r-process-rich
stars such as the well-studied CS 22892-052 and bd+173248, but also includes
the r-process-poor, bright giant HD 122563. Our results demonstrate that
abundances of the 3rd r-process peak elements Os, Ir and Pt in these metal-poor
halo stars are very well-correlated among themselves, and with the abundances
of the canonical r-process element Eu (determined in other studies), thus
arguing for a common origin or site for r-process nucleosynthesis of heavier
(Z>56) elements. However, the large (and correlated) scatters of
[Eu,Os,Ir,Pt/Fe] suggests that the heaviest neutron-capture r-process elements
are not formed in all supernovae. In contrast, the Ge abundances of all program
stars track their Fe abundances, very well. An explosive process on iron-peak
nuclei (e.g., the alpha-rich freeze-out in supernovae), rather than neutron
capture, appears to have been the dominant synthesis mechanism for this element
at low metallicities -- Ge abundances seem completely uncorrelated with Eu.",2005-02-28T20:36:28Z
"Changes in the global parameters of polytropic stars induced by the

"The circumstellar environment of T Tau S at high spatial and spectral
  resolution","We have obtained the first high spatial (0.05'') and spectral (R~35000)
resolution 2 micron spectrum of the T Tau S tight binary system using adaptive
optics on the Keck II telescope. We have also obtained the first 3.8 and 4.7
micron images that resolve the three components of the T Tau multiple system,
as well as new 1.6 and 2.2 micron images. Together with its very red
near-infrared colors, the spectrum of T Tau Sb shows that this T Tauri star is
extincted by a roughly constant extinction of Av~15 mag, which is probably the
0.7''x0.5'' circumbinary structure recently observed in absorption in the
ultraviolet. T Tau Sa, which is also observed through this screen and is
actively accreting, further possesses a small edge-on disk that is evidenced by
warm (390 K), narrow overtone CO rovibrational absorption features in our
spectrum. We find that T Tau Sa is most likely an intermediate-mass star
surrounded by a semi-transparent 2-3 AU-radius disk whose asymmetries and short
Keplerian rotation explain the large photometric variability of the source on
relatively short timescales. We also show that molecular hydrogen emission
exclusively arises from the gas that surrounds T Tau S and that its spatial and
kinematic structure, while providing suggestive evidence for a jet-like
structure, is highly complex.",2005-04-15T15:20:27Z
"The Highest Magnetic Fields in the Universe: Anomalous X-Ray Pulsars and

explained as young neutron stars with magnetic fields as high as 10e14 - 10e15
Gauss. One of these ''magnetars'', SGR 1806-20, has recently emitted the most
powerful giant flare ever recorded. The high-energy observations of SGR 1806-20
carried out with XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL in the past two years showed a long
term trend of increasing activity preceding the 2004 December 27 event.
INTEGRAL data of this giant flare provided unique evidence for hard X-ray
emission lasting about one hour after the burst onset, possibly due to the
interaction of mildly relativistic ejecta with the circumstellar medium.",2005-05-24T13:49:17Z
"The Temperature Distribution of Dense Molecular Gas in the Center of NGC
  253","[abridged] We present interferometric maps of ammonia (NH3) of the nearby
starburst galaxy NGC 253 [star formation rate: ~2.8 Mo yr^(-1)]. The
observations have been taken with the Australia Telescope Compact Array and
include the para-NH3 (1,1), (2,2), and the ortho-NH3 (3,3) and (6,6) inversion
lines. Six major complexes of dense ammonia are identified, three of them on
either side of the starburst center, out to projected galactocentric radii of
\~250 pc. [...] The application of radiative transfer large velocity gradient
models reveals that the bulk of the ammonia molecules is embedded in a
one-temperature gas phase. Kinetic temperatures of this gas are ~200 and 140 K
toward the south-west and north-east [of the nucleus of NGC 253], respectively.
The temperatures under which ammonia was formed in the past are with >~30 K
also warmer toward the south-west than toward the north-east (~15-20 K). This
is indicated by the ortho-to-para ammonia ratio which is ~1 and 1.5-2.5 toward
the south-west and north-east, respectively. Ammonia column densities in the
brightest complexes are in the range of 6-11x10^(14) cm^(-2), which adds up to
a total ammonia mass of ~20 Mo, about evenly distributed toward both sides of
the nucleus. [...] Toward the center of NGC 253, NH3 (1,1), (2,2), and (6,6) is
detected in absorption against an unresolved continuum source. At the same
location, however, ammonia (3,3) is found in emission which indicates maser
activity. This would be the first detected extragalactic NH3 maser. Evidence
for an expanding shell in the south-western complex is provided. [...] The
shell and X-ray properties can be reproduced by the energy input of a highly
obscured young stellar cluster with a mass of ~10^5 Mo which also heats the
dense gas.",2005-05-07T14:08:06Z
"Limits on the Polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation
  at Multipoles up to l~2000","We report upper limits on the polarization of the CMBR as measured with the
Cosmic Background Imager, a 13 element interferometer that operates in the
26-36 GHz band and is sited on Llano de Chajnantor in northern Chile. The array
consists of 90-cm Cassegrain antennas mounted on a steerable platform that can
be rotated about the optical axis to facilitate polarization observations. The
CBI employs single-mode circularly polarized receivers and it samples
multipoles from l~400 to l~3500. The polarization data were calibrated on 3C279

"Evidence for dust reddening in DLAs identified through CaII H&K
  absorption","We present a new sample of 31 CaII(H&K) 3935,3970 absorption line systems
with 0.84<z_abs<1.3 discovered in the spectra of Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) Data Release 3 quasars, together with an analysis of their dust content.
The presence of Calcium absorption together with measurements of the MgII 2796,
FeII 2600 and MgI 2853 lines lead to the conclusion that the majority of our
systems are Damped Ly-alpha (DLA) absorbers. The composite spectrum in the rest
frame of the absorber shows clear evidence for reddening. Large and Small
Magellanic Cloud extinction curves provide satisfactory fits, with a best-fit
E(B-V) of 0.06, while the Galactic dust extinction curve provides a poor fit
due to the lack of a strong 2175A feature. A trend of increasing dust content
with equivalent width of CaII is present. Monte Carlo techniques demonstrate
that the detection of reddening is significant at >99.99% confidence. The
discovery of significant amounts of dust in a subsample of DLAs has direct
implications for studies of the metallicity evolution of the universe and the
nature of DLAs in relation to high redshift galaxies. The gas:dust ratio is
discussed. Our results suggest that at least ~40% of the CaII absorption
systems are excluded from the magnitude-limited SDSS quasar sample as a result
of the associated extinction, a fraction similar to the upper limit deduced at
higher redshifts from radio-selected surveys.",2005-05-02T20:04:00Z
RApid Temporal Survey - RATS I: Overview and first results,"We present the aim and first results of the RApid Temporal Survey (RATS) made
using the Wide Field Camera on the Isaac Newton Telescope. Our initial survey
covers 3 square degrees, reaches a depth of V~22.5 and is sensitive to
variations on timescales as short as 2 minutes: this is a new parameter space.
Each field was observed for over 2 hours in white light, with 12 fields being
observed in total. Our initial analysis finds 46 targets which show significant
variations. Around half of these systems show quasi-sinusoidal variations: we
believe they are contact or short period binaries. We find 4 systems which show
variations on a timescale less than 1 hour. The shortest period system has a
period of 374 sec. We find two systems which show a total eclipse. Further
photometric and spectroscopic observations are required to fully identify the
nature of these systems. We outline our future plans and objectives.",2005-03-07T11:39:18Z
A Hot Wind from the Classical T Tauri Stars: TW Hydrae and T Tauri,"Spectroscopy of the infrared He I (10830A) line with KECK/NIRSPEC and
IRTF/CSHELL, and of the ultraviolet C III (977A) and O VI (1032A) emission with
FUSE reveals that the classical T Tauri star TW Hydrae exhibits P Cygni
profiles, line asymmetries, and absorption indicative of a continuous, fast
(~400 km/s), hot (~300,000 K) accelerating outflow with a mass loss rate
\~10^-11 - 10^-12 solar masses per year, or larger. Spectra of T Tauri N appear
consistent with such a wind. The source of the emission and outflow seems
restricted to the stars themselves. Although the mass accretion rate is an
order of magnitude less for TW Hya than for T Tau, the outflow reaches higher
velocities at chromospheric temperatures in TW Hya. Winds from young stellar
objects may be substantially hotter and faster than previously thought.",2005-05-02T20:03:40Z
"A search for Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium features in the X-ray spectra
  of Mkn 421 with the XMM-Newton RGS","We present the high-resolution X-ray spectra of Mkn 421 obtained in November
2003 with the RGS aboard the XMM-Newton satellite. This Target of Opportunity
observation was triggered because the source was in a high state of activity in
the X-ray band. These data are compared with three archival RGS observations of
the same source performed in November and December 2002 and one in June 2003.
We searched for the presence of absorption features due to warm-hot
intergalactic medium (WHIM). We identify various spectral features, most of
which are of instrumental origin. With the sensitivity provided by our spectra
we were able to identify only two lines of astronomical origin, namely features
at 23.5 A, probably due to interstellar neutral oxygen absorption, and at 21.6
A, which corresponds to a zero-redshift OVII K_alpha transition. For the
latter, we derive an upper limit to the gas temperature, which is consistent
with WHIM, of a few times 10^5 K, if the gas density has a value of n_e > 10^-5
cm^-3.",2005-02-28T09:25:43Z
Skyrmion Stars: Astrophysical motivations and implications,"We study mass-radius relations for compact stars employing an equation of
state (EOS) of dense matter based on a Skyrme fluid. The zero-temperature
mean-field model is based on mesonic excitations, incorporates the scale
breaking of QCD, and accommodates baryons (nucleons) which arise as a solitonic
configuration of mesonic fields. Stable configurations are obtained for central
densities $\rho_c/\rho_n\leq 5.0$ where $\rho_n=2.575\times 10^{14}$ g/cc is
the nuclear saturation density. These {\it Skyrmion Stars} are mostly fluid,
with a crust which we describe by the EOS of Baym, Pethick and Sutherland.
Their masses and radii are in the range $0.4 \le M/M_{\odot} \le 3.6$ and $13
{\rm km} \le R \le 23 {\rm km}$, respectively. The minimum spin period is
computed to be between $0.7 {\rm ms}\le P \le 2.1 {\rm ms}$. They appear to
have a mass-radius curve quite different from either neutron or quark stars,
and provide a suitable description of the heavier mass neutron stars discovered
recently due to the inherently stiff EOS. Within the same model, we compute the
dominant neutrino emissivity in neutron-rich $\beta$-equilibrated matter, and
determine the cooling behaviour of Skyrmion stars.",2005-04-04T19:58:51Z
Numerical self-consistent stellar models of thin disks,"We find a numerical self-consistent stellar model by finding the distribution
function of a thin disk that satisfies simultaneously the Fokker-Planck and
Poisson equations. The solution of the Fokker-Planck equation is found by a
direct numerical solver using finite differences and a variation of Stone's
method. The collision term in the Fokker-Planck equation is found using the
local approximation and the Rosenbluth potentials. The resulting diffusion
coefficients are explicitly evaluated using a Maxwellian distribution for the
field stars. As a paradigmatic example, we apply the numerical formalism to
find the distribution function of a Kuzmin-Toomre thin disk. This example is
studied in some detail showing that the method applies to a large family of
actual galaxies.",2005-05-12T20:02:33Z
The role of resonances in barred galaxies,"The dynamics of the inner disk of many galaxies is dominated by bars. As a
result, resonances between the bar and the disk become an important factor. In
order to detect resonances, we measure angular and radial frequencies of
individual orbits in N-body models of barred galaxies. In our simulations with
several million particles, stellar disks are immersed in live halos of dark
matter. A bar forms spontaneously and interacts with the disk through
resonances. We detect 9 of them. The corotation (CR) and the inner Lindblad
resonance (ILR) are the most significant. The spatial distributions of
particles trapped at these resonances show that ILR is not localized at a given
radius. Particles trapped at ILR lie along the bar spanning a wide range of
radii. On the other hand, particles at the corotation resonance form a ring
around the corotation radius. We study how orbits evolve near corotation and
how they are trapped. When an orbit is getting trapped, it evolves strongly,
but after that there is little evolution. Those trapped orbits circulate along
the corotation ring or librate around a stable lagragian point. The same
technique is applied to study resonances in the halo. The bar interacts
strongly with the halo particles that stay close to the disk. We find the
corotation resonance and the inner Lindblad resonance for halo particles.",2005-03-31T20:56:52Z
"VLT K-band spectroscopy of massive stars deeply embedded in IRAS sources
  with UCHII colours","We have obtained high resolution (R = 10,000) K-band spectra of candidate
young massive stars deeply embedded in (ultra-) compact HII regions (UCHIIs).
In these clusters, three types of objects are identified. The first type (38
objects) consists of ``naked'' OB stars whose K-band spectra are dominated by
photospheric emission. We classify the K-band spectra of the OB-type cluster
members using near-infrared classification criteria. The spectral
classification provides an important constraint on the distance to the embedded
cluster. The ionising power of the population thus derived is compared to the
information obtained from the infrared and radio flux of these sources. In most
cases these two different determinations of the ionising flux are consistent,
from which we conclude that we have identified the ionising star(s) in about
50% of the embedded clusters. The second type (7 objects) are point sources
associated with UCHII radio emission, that exhibit nebular emission lines in
the near-infrared. Six of the objects in this group produce HeI emission
indicative of an embedded O-type star. These objects are more embedded than the
OB stars and probably do not dominate the infrared flux as measured by IRAS.
The third type (20 objects) is characterised by broad (100--200 km/s) Brgamma
emission and no photospheric absorption profiles. Bik et al (2005) show that
these objects are massive YSO candidates surrounded by dense circumstellar
disks.",2005-05-13T18:03:55Z
"Near-infrared integral-field spectroscopy of violent starburst
  environments","Near-infrared (NIR) integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) of violent starburst
environments at high spatial (and spectral) resolution has the potential to
revolutionise our ideas regarding the local interactions between the
newly-formed massive stars and the interstellar medium (ISM) of their host
galaxies. To illustrate this point, I present NIR IFS analysis of the central
starburst region of NGC 1140, obtained with CIRPASS on Gemini-South. While
strong [FeII] emission is found throughout the galaxy, higher-order Brackett
emission is predominantly associated with the northern starburst region. Based
on the spatial distributions of the [FeII] versus Brackett line emission, I
conclude that a galaxy-wide starburst was induced several x 10^7 yr ago, with
more recent starburst activity concentrated around the northern starburst
region. I look forward and discuss the exciting prospects that IFS at higher
spatial (and spectral) resolution will allow us trace (i) the massive outflows
(""superwinds"") expected to originate in the dense, young massive star clusters
commonly found in intense starburst environments, and (ii) their impact on the
galaxy's ISM.",2005-05-20T11:23:16Z
Reconnection at the Heliopause,"In this MHD-model of the heliosphere, we assume a Parker-type flow, and a
Parker-type spiral magnetic field, which is extrapolated further downstream
from the termination shock to the heliopause. We raise the question whether the
heliopause nose region may be leaky with respect to fields and plasmas due to
nonideal plasma dynamics, implying a breakdown of the magnetic barrier. We
analyse some simple scenarios to find reconnection rates and circumstances,
under which the heliosphere can be an ""open"" or a ""closed"" magnetosphere. We do
not pretend to offer a complete solution for the heliosphere, on the basis of
nonideal MHD theory, but present a prescription to find such a solution on the
basis of potential fields including the knowledge of neutral points. As an
example we imitate the Parker spiral as a monopole with a superposition of
homogeneous asymptotical boundary conditions. We use this toy model for x < -R
where R = 100 AU is the distance of the termination shock to describe the
situation in the nose region of the heliopause.",2005-05-27T13:52:49Z
"Ly-alpha and UV emission from high-redshift GRB hosts: To what extent do
  GRBs trace star formation?","We report the result of a search for Ly-alpha emission from the host galaxies
of the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) 030226 (z = 1.986), 021004 (z = 2.335) and
020124 (z = 3.198). We find that the host galaxy of GRB 021004 is an extended
(around 8 kpc) strong Ly-alpha emitter with a restframe equivalent width (EW)
of 68^{+12}_{-11} AA, and a star-formation rate of 10.6 +/- 2.0 M_sun/yr. We do
not detect the hosts of GRB 030226 and GRB 020124, but the upper limits on
their Ly-alpha fluxes do not rule out large restframe EWs. In the fields of GRB
021004 and GRB 030226 we find seven and five other galaxies, respectively, with
excess emission in the narrow-band filter. These galaxies are candidate
Ly-alpha emitting galaxies in the environment of the host galaxies. We have
also compiled a list of all z > 2 GRB hosts, and demonstrate that a scenario
where they trace star formation in an unbiased way is compatible with current
observational constraints. Fitting the z=3 luminosity function (LF) under this
assumption, results in a characteristic luminosity of R* = 24.6 and a faint end
slope of alpha = -1.55, consistent with the LF measured for Lyman-break
galaxies.",2005-05-26T20:00:09Z
"Observations Supporting the Existence of an Intrinsic Magnetic Moment
  Inside the Central Compact Object Within the Quasar Q0957+561","Recent auto-correlation and fluctuation analysis of time series data in the
brightness curves and micro-lensing size scales seen in Q0957+561 A,B has
produced important information about the existence and characteristic physical
dimensions of a new non-standard internal structure contained within this
quasar. We find that the new internal quasar structure, which we shall call the
Schild-Vakulik Structure, can be consistently explained in terms of a new class
of gravitationally collapsing solutions to the Einstein field equations which
describe highly redshifted, Eddington limited, Magnetospheric Eternally
Collapsing Objects (MECO) that contain intrinsic magnetic moments. Since
observation of the Schild-Vakulik structure within Q0957+561 implies that this
quasar contains an observable intrinsic magnetic moment, this represents strong
evidence that this quasar does not have an event horizon",2005-05-25T17:37:09Z
Ultra High Energy Neutrino Astronomy,"The short review of theoretical aspects of ultra high energy (UHE) neutrinos
and superGZK neutrinos. The sources and diffuse fluxes of UHE neutrinos are

from the mirror mater are considered as superGZK neutrinos.",2005-05-11T06:56:36Z
"Toward a unified light curve model for multi-wavelength observations of
  V1974 Cygni (Nova Cygni 1992)","We present a unified model for optical, ultraviolet (UV), and X-ray light
curves of V1974 Cygni (Nova Cygni 1992). Based on an optically thick wind model
of nova outbursts, we have calculated light curves and searched for the best
fit model that is consistent with optical, UV, and X-ray observations. Our best
fit model is a white dwarf (WD) of mass 1.05 M_\sun with a chemical composition
of X=0.46, C+N+O=0.15, and Ne = 0.05 by mass weight. Both supersoft X-ray and
continuum UV 1455 \AA light curves are well reproduced. Supersoft X-rays
emerged on day ~ 250 after outburst, which is naturally explained by our model:
our optically thick winds cease on day 245 and supersoft X-rays emerge from
self-absorption by the winds. The X-ray flux keeps a constant peak value for ~
300 days followed by a quick decay on day ~ 600. The duration of X-ray flat
peak is well reproduced by a steady hydrogen shell burning on the WD. Optical
light curve is also explained by the same model if we introduce free-free
emission from optically thin ejecta. A t^{-1.5} slope of the observed optical
and infrared fluxes is very close to the slope of our modeled free-free light
curve during the optically thick wind phase. Once the wind stops, optical and
infrared fluxes should follow a t^{-3} slope, derived from a constant mass of
expanding ejecta. An abrupt transition from a t^{-1.5} slope to a t^{-3} slope
at day ~ 200 is naturally explained by the change from the wind phase to the
post-wind phase on day ~ 200. The development of hard X-ray flux is also
reasonably understood as shock-origin between the wind and the companion star.
The distance to V1974 Cyg is estimated to be ~ 1.7 kpc with E(B-V)= 0.32 from
the light curve fitting for the continuum UV 1455 \AA.",2005-06-10T19:35:30Z
"The Las Campanas Infra-red Survey. V. Keck Spectroscopy of a large
  sample of Extremely Red Objects","(Abridged) We present deep Keck spectroscopy, using the DEIMOS and LRIS
spectrographs, of a large and representative sample of 67 ``Extremely Red
Objects'' (EROs) to H=20.5, with I-H>3.0, in three of the Las Campanas Infrared
Survey fields. Spectroscopic redshifts are determined for 44 sources, of which
only two are contaminating low mass stars. When allowance is made for
incompleteness, the spectroscopic redshift distribution closely matches that
predicted earlier on the basis of photometric data. Our spectra are of
sufficient quality that we can address the important question of the nature and
homogeneity of the z>0.8 ERO population. A dominant old stellar population is
inferred for 75% of our spectroscopic sample; a higher fraction than that seen
in smaller, less-complete samples with broader photometric selection criteria
(e.g. R-K). However, only 28% have spectra with no evidence of recent star
formation activity, such as would be expected for a strictly passively-evolving
population. More than ~30% of our absorption line spectra are of the `E+A' type
with prominent Balmer absorption consistent, on average, with mass growth of
5-15% in the past Gyr. We use our spectroscopic redshifts to improve earlier
estimates of the spatial clustering of this population as well as to understand
the significant field-to-field variation. Our spectroscopy enables us to
pinpoint a filamentary structure at z=1.22 in the Chandra Deep Field South.
Overall, our study suggests that the bulk of the ERO population is an
established population of clustered massive galaxies undergoing intermittent
activity consistent with continued growth over the redshift interval 0.8<z<1.6.",2005-05-06T11:04:10Z
"Evidence for Primordial Clustering Around the QSO SDSS J1030+0524 at
  z=6.28","We present tentative evidence for primordial clustering, manifested as an
excess of color-selected objects in the field of the QSO SDSS J1030+0524 at
redshift z=6.28. We have selected objects red in i_{775}-z_{850} on the basis
of Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging of a field
centered on the QSO. Compared to data at comparable depth obtained by the GOODS
survey, we find an excess of objects with (i_{775}-z_{850}) \geq 1.5 in the QSO
field. The significance of the detection is estimated to be ~97% on the basis
of the counts alone and increases to 99.4% if one takes into account the color
distribution. If confirmed this would represent the highest redshift example of
galaxy clustering and would have implications on models for the growth of
structure. Bias-driven clustering of first luminous objects forming in the
highest peaks of the primordial density field is expected in most models of
early structure formation. The redshift of one of the candidates has been found
to be z=5.970 by our spectroscopy with Keck I/LRIS, confirming the validity of
our color selection.",2005-02-10T18:16:36Z
"86 GHz SiO maser survey of late-type stars in the Inner Galaxy III.
  Interstellar extinction and colours of the SiO targets","We have determined extinction corrections for a sample of 441 late-type stars
in the inner Galaxy, which we previously searched for SiO maser emission, using
the 2MASS near-infrared photometry of the surrounding stars. From this, the
near-infrared extinction law is found to be approximated by a power law
A$_\lambda \propto \lambda^{-1.9\pm0.1}$. Near- and mid-infrared colour-colour
properties of known Mira stars are reviewed. From the distribution of the
dereddened infrared colours of the SiO target stars we infer mass-loss rates
between $10^{-7}$ and $10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$.",2005-03-08T10:43:01Z
"Radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies of Keplerian motion in the
  field of Kerr naked singularities - comparison with the black hole case and
  possible instability of naked singularity accretion discs","Relativistic Keplerian orbital frequency and related epicyclic frequencies
play an important role in physics of accretion discs orbiting Kerr black holes
and can by resonant or trapping effects explain quasiperiodic oscillations
observed in microquasars. Because of growing theoretical evidence on possible
existence of naked singularities, we discuss behaviour of the fundamenal
orbital frequencies for Keplerian motion in the field of Kerr naked
singularities, primarily in order to find phenomena that could observationally
distinguish a hypothetical naked singularity from black holes. Some
astrophysically important consequences are sketched, namely the existence of
strong resonant frequency for all Kerr naked singularities, with radial and
vertical epicyclic frequencies being equal at well defined radius.",2005-02-06T20:28:07Z
"Formation of molecular hydrogen on analogues of interstellar dust
  grains: experiments and modelling","Molecular hydrogen has an important role in the early stages of star
formation as well as in the production of many other molecules that have been
detected in the interstellar medium. In this review we show that it is now
possible to study the formation of molecular hydrogen in simulated
astrophysical environments. Since the formation of molecular hydrogen is
believed to take place on dust grains, we show that surface science techniques
such as thermal desorption and time-of-flight can be used to measure the
recombination efficiency, the kinetics of reaction and the dynamics of
desorption. The analysis of the experimental results using rate equations gives
useful insight on the mechanisms of reaction and yields values of parameters
that are used in theoretical models of interstellar cloud chemistry.",2005-04-25T15:26:44Z
Discovery of Oxygen Kalpha X-ray Emission from the Rings of Saturn,"Using the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS), the Chandra X-ray
Observatory (CXO) observed the Saturnian system for one rotation of the planet
(~37 ks) on 20 January, 2004, and again on 26-27 January, 2004. In this letter
we report the detection of X-ray emission from the rings of Saturn. The X-ray
spectrum from the rings is dominated by emission in a narrow (~130 eV wide)
energy band centered on the atomic oxygen K-alpha fluorescence line at 0.53
keV. The X-ray power emitted from the rings in the 0.49-0.62 keV band is 84 MW,
which is about one-third of that emitted from Saturn disk in the photon energy
range 0.24-2.0 keV. Our analysis also finds a clear detection of X-ray emission
from the rings in the 0.49-0.62 keV band in an earlier (14-15 April, 2003)
Chandra ACIS observation of Saturn. Fluorescent scattering of solar X-rays from
oxygen atoms in the H2O icy ring material is the likely source mechanism for
ring X-rays, consistent with the scenario of solar photo-production of a
tenuous ring oxygen atmosphere and ionosphere recently discovered by Cassini.",2005-05-19T14:13:24Z
"The Canis Major dwarf galaxy as the progenitor of the Monoceros tidal
  stream","The Sloan Digital Sky Survey has recently discovered a coherent ring of stars
at low galactic latitude that is believed to be the tidal stream of a merging
dwarf galaxy in the Galactic plane (named the Monoceros tidal stream). The
existence and location of the core of its progenitor galaxy is still
controversial. The best candidate is the Canis Major dwarf galaxy, a distinct
overdensity of red stars discovered in the 2MASS survey, but also interpreted
as the signature of the Galactic warp viewed in projection. In this paper, we
report a variety of new observational evidence that supports the notion that
CMa is the remnant of a partially disrupted core of a dwarf satellite. The
comparison of the orbit derived from our theoretical model for the parent
galaxy of this ring-like structure with an accurate determination of CMa orbit
leads to the conclusion that this satellite is the best candidate for the
progenitor of the Monoceros tidal stream.",2005-06-01T10:05:07Z
On the volatile enrichments and composition of Jupiter,"Using the clathrate hydrates trapping theory, we discuss the enrichments in
volatiles in the atmosphere of Jupiter measured by the \textit{Galileo} probe
in the framework of new extended core-accretion planet formation models
including migration and disk evolution. We construct a self-consistent model in
which the volatile content of planetesimals accreted during the formation of
Jupiter is calculated from the thermodynamical evolution of the disk. Assuming
CO2:CO:CH4 = 30:10:1 (ratios compatible with ISM measurements), we show that we
can explain the enrichments in volatiles in a way compatible with the recent
constraints set from internal structure modeling on the total amount of heavy
elements present in the planet.",2005-02-16T18:23:27Z
"A Definitive Measurement of Time Dilation in the Spectral Evolution of
  the Moderate-Redshift Type Ia Supernova 1997ex","We have obtained high-quality Keck optical spectra at three epochs of the
Type Ia supernova 1997ex, whose redshift z is 0.361. The elapsed calendar time
between the first two spectra was 24.88 d, and that between the first and third
spectra was 30.95 d. In an expanding universe where 1 + z represents the factor
by which space has expanded between the emission and detection of light, the
amount of aging in the supernova rest frame should be a factor of 1 / (1 + z)
smaller than the observed-frame aging; thus, we expect SN 1997ex to have aged
18.28 d and 22.74 d between the first epoch and the second and third epochs,
respectively. The quantitative method for determining the spectral-feature age
of a SN Ia, developed by Riess et al. (1997), reveals that the corresponding
elapsed times in the supernova rest frame were 16.97 +/- 2.75 d and 18.01 +/-
3.14 d, respectively. This result is inconsistent with no time dilation with a
significance level of 99.0%, providing evidence against ""tired light"" and other
hypotheses in which no time dilation is expected. Moreover, the observed
timescale of spectral evolution is inconsistent with that expected in the
""variable mass theory."" The result is within ~1 sigma of the aging expected
from a universe in which redshift is produced by cosmic expansion.",2005-04-21T18:30:06Z
"A Keck/DEIMOS Kinematic Study of Andromeda IX: dark matter on the
  smallest galactic scales","We present the results of a kinematic survey of the dwarf spheroidal
satellite of M31, And-IX, which appears to be the lowest surface brightness and
also the faintest galaxy (M_V = -8.3) found to date. Using Keck/DEIMOS
spectroscopic data, we have measured its velocity relative to M31, its velocity
dispersion, and its metallicity. It exhibits a significant velocity dispersion
sigma_v = 6.8+3.0-2.0km/s, which coupled with the low luminosity implies a very
high mass to V-band light ratio, M/L ~ 93+120-50msun/lsun (M/L > 17msun/lsun at
99% confidence). Unless strong tidal forces have perturbed this system, this
smallest of galaxies is a highly dark matter dominated system.",2005-06-06T01:09:00Z
"On the origin of the radial mass density profile of the Galactic halo
  Globular Cluster System","We investigate what may be the origin of the presently observed spatial
distribution of the mass of the Galactic Old Halo globular cluster system. We
propose its radial mass density profile to be a relic of the distribution of
the cold baryonic material in the protoGalaxy. Assuming that this one arises
from the profile of the whole protoGalaxy minus the contribution of the dark
matter (and a small contribution of the hot gas by which the protoglobular
clouds were bound), we show that the mass distributions around the Galactic
centre of this cold gas and of the Old Halo agree satisfactorily. In order to
demonstrate our hypothesis even more conclusively, we simulate the evolution
with time, up to an age of 15 Gyr, of a putative globular cluster system whose
initial mass distribution in the Galactic halo follows the profile of the cold
protogalactic gas. We show that beyond a galactocentric distance of order 2 to
3 kpc, the initial shape of such a mass density profile is preserved in spite
of the complete destruction of some globular clusters and the partial
evaporation of some others. This result is almost independent of the choice of
the initial mass function for the globular clusters, which is still
ill-determined. The shape of these evolved cluster system mass density profiles
also agree with the presently observed profile of the Old Halo globular cluster
system, thus strengthening our hypothesis. Our result might suggest that the
flattening shown by the Old Halo mass density profile at short distance from
the Galactic centre is, at least partly, of primordial origin.",2005-02-22T11:15:13Z
"[Fe/H] relations for c-type RR Lyrae Variables based upon Fourier
  Coefficients","[Fe/H] - phi_31 - log P relations are found for c-type RR Lyrae stars in
globular clusters. The relations are analogous to that found by Jurcsik &
Kovacs (1996) for field ab-type RR Lyrae stars, where a larger period
correlates with lower metallicity values for similar values of the Fourier
coefficient phi_31. The relations obtained here are used to determine the
metallicity of field c-type RR Lyrae stars, those within omega Cen, the LMC and
toward the galactic bulge. The results are found to compare favorably to
metallicity values obtained elsewhere.",2005-06-15T15:49:54Z
Spectroscopy with Multichannel Correlation Radiometers,"Correlation radiometers make true differential measurements in power with
high accuracy and small systematic errors. This receiver architecture has been
used in radio astronomy for measurements of continuum radiation for over 50
years; this article examines spectroscopy over broad bandwidths using
correlation techniques. After general discussions of correlation and the choice
of hybrid phase, experimental results from tests with a simple laboratory
multi-channel correlation radiometer are shown. Analysis of the effect of the
input hybrid's phase shows that a 90 degree hybrid is likely to be the best
general choice for radio astronomy, depending on its amplitude match and phase
flatness with frequency. The laboratory results verify that the combination of
the correlation architecture and an analog lag correlator is an excellent
method for spectroscopy over very wide bandwidths.",2005-04-20T18:59:35Z
Interferometric Observations of V838 Monocerotis,"We have used long-baseline near-IR interferometry to resolve the peculiar
eruptive variable V838 Mon and to provide the first direct measurement of its
angular size. Assuming a uniform disk model for the emission we derive an
apparent angular diameter at the time of observations (November-December 2004)
of $1.83 \pm 0.06$ milli-arcseconds. For a nominal distance of $8\pm2$ kpc,
this implies a linear radius of $1570 \pm 400 R_{\odot}$. However, the data are
somewhat better fit by elliptical disk or binary component models, and we
suggest that the emission may be strongly affected by ejecta from the outburst.",2005-02-15T14:27:20Z
"Cosmological Implications of the Uncertainty in H- Destruction Rate
  Coefficients","In primordial gas, molecular hydrogen forms primarily through associative
detachment of H- and H, thereby destroying the H-. The H- anion can also be
destroyed by a number of other reactions, most notably by mutual neutralization
with protons. However, neither the associative detachment nor the mutual
neutralization rate coefficients are well determined: both may be uncertain by
as much as an order of magnitude. This introduces a corresponding uncertainty
into the H2 formation rate, which may have cosmological implications. Here, we
examine the effect that these uncertainties have on the formation of H2 and the
cooling of protogalactic gas in a variety of situations. We show that the
effect is particularly large for protogalaxies forming in previously ionized
regions, affecting our predictions of whether or not a given protogalaxy can
cool and condense within a Hubble time, and altering the strength of the
ultraviolet background that is required to prevent collapse.",2005-06-09T22:43:51Z
"Long-lag, Wide-Pulse Gamma-Ray Bursts","Currently, the best available probe of the early phase of gamma-ray burst
(GRB) jet attributes is the prompt gamma-ray emission, in which several
intrinsic and extrinsic variables determine GRB pulse evolution. Bright,
usually complex bursts have many narrow pulses that are difficult to model due
to overlap. However, the relatively simple, long spectral lag, wide-pulse
bursts may have simpler physics and are easier to model. In this work we
analyze the temporal and spectral behavior of wide pulses in 24 long-lag
bursts, using a pulse model with two shape parameters -- width and asymmetry --
and the Band spectral model with three shape parameters. We find that pulses in
long-lag bursts are distinguished both temporally and spectrally from those in
bright bursts: the pulses in long spectral lag bursts are few in number, and ~
100 times wider (10s of seconds), have systematically lower peaks in nu*F(nu),
harder low-energy spectra and softer high-energy spectra. We find that these
five pulse descriptors are essentially uncorrelated for our long-lag sample,
suggesting that at least five parameters are needed to model burst temporal and
spectral behavior. However, pulse width is strongly correlated with spectral
lag; hence these two parameters may be viewed as mutual surrogates. We infer
that accurate formulations for estimating GRB luminosity and total energy will
depend on several gamma-ray attributes, at least for long-lag bursts. The
prevalence of long-lag bursts near the BATSE trigger threshold, their
predominantly low nF(n) spectral peaks, and relatively steep upper power-law
spectral indices indicate that Swift will detect many such bursts.",2005-03-17T20:18:26Z
On the Origin of the Eccentricities of Extrasolar Planets,"We develop a phenomenological theory that aims to account for the origin of
the large eccentricities of extrasolar planets and that of the small
eccentricities in the solar system, the preference for apsidal alignment in
non-resonant multiplanet systems, and the origin of the similarities in the
eccentricity distribution of extra-solar planets and that of spectroscopic
binary stars. We show that if a physical process is weakly dependent on the
local dynamics of the companion and imparts a small relative acceleration to
the star-companion system, the eccentricity of the companion's orbit is excited
to large values depending on the direction and duration of acceleration. A
natural candidate for such processes are asymmetric stellar jets and star-disk
winds. When the acceleration originates from a precessing jet, large
eccentricities can be excited by the resonance of the jet's precession
frequency with the induced acceleration's excitation frequency even for nearly
perpendicular jets. Precession also reduces the eccentricity amplitude far
inside the resonance radius. The acceleration's strength is best constrained in
multiplanet systems because of the companions' mutual gravitational
perturbations, while the acceleration's duration is bounded by the condition
that the residual velocity imparted to the star is smaller than the stellar
velocity dispersion in the Galaxy. In the outer parts of the star-companion
system where the acceleration excitation time is comparable to or smaller than
the orbital period, significant radial migration takes place which may have
important consequences for the dynamics of the minor body populations in the
solar system. The theory is illustrated with the $\upsilon$ Andromedae binary
system.",2005-03-28T17:17:38Z
"Direct Measurements of Black Hole Charge with Future Astrometrical
  Missions","Recently, Zakharov et al. (2005) considered the possibility of evaluating the
spin parameter and the inclination angle for Kerr black holes in nearby
galactic centers by using future advanced astrometrical instruments. A similar
approach which uses the characteristic properties of gravitational
retro-lensing images can be followed to measure the charge of
Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. Indeed, in spite of the fact that their
formation might be problematic, charged black holes are objects of intensive
investigations. From the theoretical point of view it is well-known that a
black hole is described by only three parameters, namely, its mass M, angular
momentum J and charge Q. Therefore, it would be important to have a method for
measuring all these parameters, preferably by model independent way. In this
paper, we propose a procedure to measure the black hole charge by using the
size of the retro-lensing images that can be revealed by future astrometrical
missions. A discussion of the Kerr-Newmann black hole case is also offered.",2005-05-13T15:35:57Z
Infrared Echoes near the Supernova Remnant Cassiopeia A,"Two images of Cassiopeia A obtained at 24 micrometer with the Spitzer Space
Telescope over a one year time interval show moving structures outside the
shell of the supernova remnant to a distance of more than 20 arcmin. Individual
features exhibit apparent motions of 10 to 20 arcsec per year, independently
confirmed by near-infrared observations. The observed tangential velocities are
at roughly the speed of light. It is likely that the moving structures are
infrared echoes, in which interstellar dust is heated by the explosion and by
flares from the compact object near the center of the remnant.",2005-06-08T20:25:48Z
Spectroscopic and Photometric Observations of SN IIn 1995N,"We present the results of a long-term program of monitoring of the famous SN
1995N, observed both in photometry (UBVRIJHK bands) and optical spectroscopy.
The observations span a period of about 9 years. These new data, together with
others available in literature, extend from the X-ray wavelengths to the radio,
and allow to estimate the total energy radiated by the supernova over a decade
after its explosion.",2005-04-05T16:35:09Z
Neutrino Astronomy beyond and beneath the Horizons,"The Earth's Shadow to Cosmic Rays offer a windows to Tau Neutrino Astronomy
at the Horizon edges. Inclined and Horizontal C.R. Showers (70^o-90^o zenith
angle) produce secondary (gamma,e) mostly suppressed by high column atmosphere
depth. The shower Cherenkov photons are diluted and filtered by air opacity,
but secondary penetrating, muon pairs and their decay into electron pairs,
revive additional Cerenkov flash lights. Most largest GeVs gamma telescopes may
detect such UHECR horizontal showers. Arrival angle and column depth, shower
shape, timing may inform on the altitude interaction and on primary UHECR
composition. At larger zenith angle (90^o-99^o) more rare up-going showers are
traced by muon (as well electromagnetic) bundles that would give evidence of
rare Earth-Skimming neutrinos, tau and anti-tau neutrinos, at PeVs-EeVs
energies. Their rate may be comparable with 6.3 PeVs anti-neutrino electron
induced air-shower originated in interposed atmosphere, by W^- resonance at
Glashow peak. Additional and complementary UHE SUSY neutralino or staus may
blaze. Their nature might be disentangled by Stereoscopic Telescopes array.
Magic and Hess telescope in present set up may be already comparable to AMANDA
underground neutrino detector. Such telescopes pointing at the horizons toward
active sources (AGN,BL Lac Objects, GRBs or SGRs blazing micro-quasar jet, and
SNRs) do experience in those directions an air mass corresponding to a km^3
water one. Therefore Horizontal Showering is already the most sensitive windows
to Neutrino Astronomy possibly pointing to AGN,GRB or SGR events.",2005-05-21T16:26:26Z
"Luminosity-dependent evolution of soft X-ray selected AGN: New Chandra
  and XMM-Newton surveys","We present new results on the cosmological evolution of unabsorbed (type-1)
active galactic nuclei (AGN) selected in the soft (0.5-2 keV) X-ray band. From
a variety of ROSAT, XMM-Newton and Chandra surveys we selected a total of ~1000
AGN with an unprecedented spectroscopic and photometric optical/NIR
identification completeness. For the first time we are able to derive reliable
space densities for low-luminosity (Seyfert-type) X-ray sources at cosmological
redshifts. The evolutionary behaviour of AGN shows a strong dependence on X-ray
luminosity: while the space density of high-luminosity AGN reaches a peak
around z~2, similar to that of optically selected QSO, the space density of
low-luminosity AGNs peaks at redshifts below z=1. This confirms previous ROSAT
findings of a luminosity-dependent density evolution. Using a rigorous
treatment of the optical identification completeness we are able to show that
the space density of AGN with X-ray luminosities L_x < 10^45 erg s^-1 declines
significantly towards high redshifts.",2005-06-06T17:38:13Z
Advances in Multi-Dimensional Simulation of Core-Collapse Supernovae,"We discuss recent advances in the radiative-hydrodynamic modeling of core
collapse supernovae in multi-dimensions. A number of earlier attempts at fully
radiation-hydrodynamic models utilized either the grey approximation to
describe the neutrino distribution or utilized more sophisticated multigroup
transport methods restricted to radial rays. In both cases these models have
also neglected the O(v/c) terms that couple the radiation and matter strongly
in the optically thick regions of the collapsed core. In this paper we present
some recent advances that resolve some shortcomings of earlier models.",2005-06-08T19:21:38Z
Possible Explanation to Low CMB Quadrupole,"The universe might experience many cycles with different vacua. The slow-roll
inflation may be preceded by kinetic-dominated contraction occurring in
""adjacent"" vacua during some cycles. In this report we briefly show this
phenomenon may lead to a cutoff of primordial power spectrum. Thus in some
sense the CMB at large angular scale might encode the information of other
vacua.",2005-02-17T09:24:04Z
Thermal emission in the prompt phase of gamma-ray bursts,"I discuss the interpretation of the prompt phase in gamma-ray bursts as being
dominated by quasi-thermal emission, rather than by synchrotron emission. Such
an interpretation gives a more natural explanation of (i) the observed variety
of spectral shape and spectral evolution, (ii) the observed narrowness of the
distribution of peak energies, as well as (iii) the observed correlations
between peak energy and luminosity. However, the physical setting that could
produce such a scenario is not yet clear.",2005-04-25T14:00:34Z
Soft Gamma-Ray Bursts in the BATSE data,"We performed the scan of the BATSE DISCLA records inspecting 25-50 keV range
to pick up soft GRBs. We applied the same technique as in our previous (Stern
et al. 2001) scan in the 50-300 keV range. We scanned about 1.8 year of the
data and found 30 new gamma-ray burst (GRB)s. The total number of soft GRBs in
the BATSE data, with the count rate in the 25-50 keV range higher than in the
50-300 keV range, is only 4%. There are about two extremely soft events per
year which are invisible about 50 keV and which could constitute a new class of
events separate from the GRB phenomenon. We also show that X-ray flashes (XRFs)
detected by BeppoSAX have a hardness ratio very similar to that of normal GRBs,
supporting a view that XRFs and GRBs are a single phenomenon with a wide
spectral variety.",2005-05-24T13:39:17Z
X-ray Diagnostics of Broad Absorption Line Quasar Geometry,"A new generation of sensitive X-ray measurements are indicating that the
existence of X-ray attenuation column densities,
$N_{H}>10^{24}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ is quite common amongst broad absorption line
quasars (BALQSOs). This is significant to the geometry of the broad absorption
line (BAL) outflow. In particular, such an X-ray shield also shields equatorial
accretion disk winds from the UV, thereby preventing high velocity equatorial
outflows from being launched. By contrast, bipolar winds initiated by continuum
radiation pressure from the funnel of a slim accretion disk flare outward (like
a trumpet) and offer vastly different absorbing columns to the X-ray and UV
emission which are emitted from distinct regions of the disk, $\sim 6M$ and
$\sim 10M-40M$, respectively (where $M$ is the radius of the black hole).
Recent numerical work indicates that it is also possible to launch bipolar
outflows from the inner regions of a thin disk. The recent discovery with VLBI
that the Galactic analog of a BALQSO, the X-ray binary Circinus X-1 (with high
velocity P Cygni X-ray absorption lines) is viewed virtually along the radio
jet axis (and therefore along the spin axis of the black hole and the normal to
the accretion disk) has rekindled interest in the bipolar models of BALQSOs. We
explore this possibility by studying the nearest BAL QSO, MRK 231. High
resolution 2-D optical spectroscopy and VLBI mappings of the radio jet axis
indicates that the BAL outflow is parallel to the parsec scale radio jet.",2005-03-09T20:39:04Z
INTEGRAL observations of SS433: Results of coordinated campaign,"Results of simultaneous INTEGRAL and optical observations of galactic
microquasar SS433 in May 2003 and INTEGRAL/RXTE observations in March 2004 are
presented. Persistent precessional variability with a maximum to minimum
uneclipsed hard X-ray flux ratio of \sim 4 is discovered. The 18-60 keV X-ray
eclipse is found to be in phase with optical and near infrared eclipses. The
orbital eclipse observed by INTEGRAL in May 2003 is at least two times deeper
and apparently wider than in soft X-ray band. The broadband X-ray spectrum
2-100 keV simultaneously detected by RXTE/INTEGRAL in March 2004 can be
described by bremsstrahlung emission from optically thin thermal plasma with
kT\sim 30 keV. The optical spectroscopy with the 6-m SAO BTA telescope
confirmed the optical companion to be an A5-A7 supergiant. For the first time,
spectorscopic indications of a strong heating effect in the optical star
atmosphere are found. The measurements of absorption lines which are presumably
formed in the non-illuminated side of the supergiant yield its radial velocity
semi-amplitude K_v=132\pm 9 km/s. The analysis of the observed hard X-ray light
curve and the eclipse duration, combined with spectroscopically found optical
star radial velocity corrected for the strong heating effect, allows us to
model SS433 as a massive X-ray binary. Assuming that the hard X-ray source in
SS433 is eclipsed by the donor star that exactly fills its Roche lobe, the
masses of the optical and compact components in SS433 are suggested to be
M_v\approx 30 M_\odot and M_x\approx 9M_\odot, respectively. This provides
further evidence that SS433 is a massive binary system with supercritical
accretion onto a black hole.",2005-03-16T16:15:37Z
The first near infrared detection of XTE J1118+480 in quiescence,"We report the first quiescent detection of KV UMa, the optical counterpart of
XTE J1118+480 at near infrared. The observed magnitudes and colours are
consistent with a K7-M0 V star, at the distance 1.4 +/- 0.2 kpc. The light
curve shows strong orbital modulation with possible contamination from a
superhump detected in the quiescent optical light curves.",2005-05-26T12:54:06Z
System Parameters of the Transiting Extrasolar Planet HD 209458b,"We derive improved system parameters for the HD 209458 system using a model
that simultaneously fits both photometric transit and radial velocity
observations. The photometry consists of previous Hubble Space Telescope STIS
and FGS observations, twelve I-band transits observed between 2001-2003 with
the Mt. Laguna Observatory 1m telescope, and six Stromgren b+y transits
observed between 2001-2004 with two of the Automatic Photometric Telescopes at
Fairborn Observatory. The radial velocities were derived from Keck/HIRES
observations. The model properly treats the orbital dynamics of the system, and
thus yields robust and physically self-consistent solutions. Our set of system
parameters agrees with previously published results though with improved
accuracy. For example, applying robust limits on the stellar mass of
0.93-1.20Msun, we find 1.26 < Rplanet < 1.42 Rjup and 0.59 < Mplanet < 0.70
Mjup. We can reduce the uncertainty on these estimates by including a stellar
mass-radius relation constraint, yielding Rplanet = 1.35 +/- 0.07 Rjup and
Mplanet = 0.66 +/- 0.04 Mjup. Our results verify that the planetary radius is
10-20% larger than predicted by planet evolution models, confirming the need
for an additional mechanism to slow the evolutionary contraction of the planet.
A revised ephemeris is derived, T0=2452854.82545 + 3.52474554E (HJD), which now
contains an uncertainty in the period of 0.016s and should facilitate future
searches for planetary satellites and other bodies in the HD 209458 system.",2005-04-26T18:55:18Z
The near-infrared size-luminosity relations for Herbig Ae/Be disks,"We report the results of a sensitive K-band survey of Herbig Ae/Be disk sizes
using the 85-m baseline Keck Interferometer. Targets were chosen to span the
maximum range of stellar properties to probe the disk size dependence on
luminosity and effective temperature. For most targets, the measured
near-infrared sizes (ranging from 0.2 to 4 AU) support a simple disk model
possessing a central optically-thin (dust-free) cavity, ringed by hot dust
emitting at the expected sublimation temperatures (T_sub~1000-1500K).
Furthermore, we find a tight correlation of disk size with source luminosity R
propto L^(1/2) for Ae and late Be systems (valid over more than 2 decades in
luminosity), confirming earlier suggestions based on lower-quality data.
Interestingly, the inferred dust-free inner cavities of the highest luminosity
sources (Herbig B0-B3 stars) are under-sized compared to predictions of the
optically-thin cavity model, likely due to optically-thick gas within the inner
AU.",2005-02-12T21:54:47Z
"What will anisotropies in the clustering pattern in redshifted 21 cm
  maps tell us?","The clustering pattern in high redshift HI maps is expected to be anisotropic
due to two distinct reasons, the
  Alcock-Paczynski effect and the peculiar velocities, both of which are
sensitive to the cosmological parameters. The signal is also expected to be
sensitive to the details of the HI distribution at the epoch when the radiation
originated. We use simple models for the HI distribution at the epoch of
reionizaation and the post-reionization era to investigate exactly what we hope
to learn from future observations of the anisotropy pattern in HI maps. We find
that such observations will probably tell us more about the HI distribution
than about the background cosmological model. Assuming that reionization can be
described by spherical, ionized bubbles all of the same size with their centers
possibly being biased with respect to the dark matter, we find that the
anisotropy pattern at small angles is expected to have a bump at the
characteristic angular size of the individual bubbles whereas the large scale
anisotropy pattern will reflect the size and the bias of the bubbles. The
anisotropy also depends on the background cosmological parameters, but the
dependence is much weaker. Under the assumption that the HI in the
post-reionization era traces the dark matter with a possible bias, we find that
changing the bias and changing the background cosmology has similar effects on
the anisotropy pattern. Combining observations of the anisotropy with
independent estimates of the bias, possibly from the bi-spectrum, may allow
these observations to constrain cosmological parameters.",2005-03-10T10:24:32Z
"Primordial Gravitational Waves and Inflation: CMB and Direct Detection
  With Space-Based Laser Interferometers","The curl-modes of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization probe
horizon-scale primordial gravitational waves related to inflation. A
significant source of confusion is expected from a lensing conversion of
polarization related to density perturbations to the curl mode, during the
propagation of photons through the large scale structure. Either high
resolution CMB anisotropy observations or 21 cm fluctuations at redshifts 30
and higher can be used to delens polarization data and to separate
gravitational-wave polarization signature from that of cosmic-shear related
signal. Separations based on proposed lensing reconstruction techniques for
reasonable future experiments allow the possibility to probe inflationary
energy scales down to 10^15 GeV. Beyond CMB polarization, at frequencies
between 0.01 Hz to 1 Hz, space-based laser interferometers can also be used to
probe the inflationary gravitational wave background. The confusion here is
related to the removal of merging neutron star binaries at cosmological
distances. Given the low merger rate and the rapid evolution of the
gravitational wave frequency across this band, reliable removal techniques can
be constructed. We discuss issues related to joint constraints that can be
placed on the inflationary models based on CMB polarization information and
space-based interferometers such as the Big Bang Observer.",2005-03-05T00:22:41Z
"Modeling complete distributions with incomplete observations: The
  velocity ellipsoid from Hipparcos data","[abridged] A ""missing data"" algorithm is developed to model (ie, reconstruct)
the three-dimensional velocity distribution function of a sample of stars using
data (velocity measurements) every one of which has one dimension unmeasured
(the radial direction). It also accounts for covariant measurement
uncertainties on the tangential velocity components. The algorithm is applied
to tangential velocities measured in a kinematically unbiased sample of 11,865
stars taken from the Hipparcos catalog. The local stellar velocity distribution
function of each of a set of 20 color-selected subsamples is modeled as a
mixture of two three-dimensional Gaussian ellipsoids of arbitrary relative
responsibility. In the fitting, one Gaussian (the ""halo"") is fixed at the known
mean velocity and velocity variance tensor of the Galaxy halo, and the other
(the ""disk"") is allowed to take arbitrary mean and arbitrary variance tensor.
The mean and variance tensor (commonly the ""velocity ellipsoid"") of the disk
velocity distribution are both found to be strong functions of stellar color,
with long-lived populations showing larger velocity dispersion, slower mean
rotation velocity, and smaller vertex deviation than short-lived populations.
The local standard of rest (LSR) is inferred in the usual way and the Sun's
motion relative to the LSR is found to be
(U,V,W)_{\odot}=(10.1,4.0,6.7)+/-(0.5,0.8,0.2) km/s. Artificial data sets are
made and analyzed, with the same error properties as the Hipparcos data, to
demonstrate that the analysis is unbiased. The results are shown to be
insensitive to the assumption that the velocity distributions are Gaussian.",2005-05-03T13:37:42Z
"Detection of steam in the circumstellar disk around a massive Young
  Stellar Object","We report on the observation of hot water vapor (steam) in the inner AU of a
young massive star located in the star-forming region IRAS 08576-4334. The
water lines are detected in a medium resolution (R=10,000) K-band spectrum
taken by the infrared spectrometer ISAAC mounted on the VLT-ANTU. The water
vapor is at a mean temperature of 1565+/-510 K, cooler than the hot CO found in
the same object, which is at 1660K and the column density is N(H2O)=(2.5 +/-
0.4)x1E18 cm-2. The profile of both H2O and CO lines is best reproduced by the
emission from a Keplerian disk. To interpret the data, we also investigate the
formation of molecules and especially CO and water vapor in the inner hot and
dense part of disks around young high mass stars using a pseudo time-dependent
gas-phase chemical model. Molecules are rapidly photodissociated but this
destruction is compensated by an efficient formation due to fast
neutral-neutral reactions. The ability of CO molecules to self-shield
significantly enhances its abundance. Water molecules are sufficiently abundant
to be detectable. The observed H2O/CO ratio is reproduced by gas at 1600K and
an enhanced UV field over gas density ratio I_UV/nH=1E(-4)- 1E(-6). The
simulations support the presence of CO and H2O molecules in the inner disks
around young massive stars despite the strong UV radiation and show that the OH
radical plays an essential role in hot gas chemistry.",2005-03-24T16:18:08Z

Inverse Compton X-ray Flare from GRB Reverse Shock,"We study synchrotron self-inverse Compton radiation from a reverse-shocked
fireball. If the inverse Compton process dominates the cooling of shocked
electrons, an X-ray flare produced by the first order Compton scattering would
emerge in the very early afterglow phase, with the bulk of the shock energy
radiated in the second order scattering component at 10-100 MeV. The dominance
of inverse Compton cooling leads to the lack of prompt optical flashes. We show
that for plausible parameters this scattering process can produce an X-ray
flare with a relative amplitude change by a factor of several. Flares with a
larger amplitude and multiple X-ray flares in a single event are likely to be
produced by another mechanism (e.g. internal shocks).",2005-06-08T00:39:44Z
The Limits of Quintessence,"We present evidence that the simplest particle-physics scalar-field models of
dynamical dark energy can be separated into distinct behaviors based on the
acceleration or deceleration of the field as it evolves down its potential
towards a zero minimum. We show that these models occupy narrow regions in the
phase-plane of w and w', the dark energy equation-of-state and its
time-derivative in units of the Hubble time. Restricting an energy scale of the
dark energy microphysics limits how closely a scalar field can resemble a
cosmological constant. These results, indicating a desired measurement
resolution of order \sigma(w')\approx (1+w), define firm targets for
observational tests of the physics of dark energy.",2005-05-24T20:00:12Z
The powerful outburst in Hercules A,"The radio source Hercules A resides at the center of a cooling flow cluster
of galaxies at redshift z = 0.154. A Chandra X-ray image reveals a shock front
in the intracluster medium (ICM) surrounding the radio source, about 160 kpc
from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) that hosts it. The shock has a Mach
number of 1.65, making it the strongest of the cluster-scale shocks driven by
an AGN outburst found so far. The age of the outburst ~5.9e7 y, its energy
about 3e61 erg and its mean power ~1.6e46 erg/s. As for the other large AGN
outbursts in cooling flow clusters, this outburst overwhelms radiative losses
from the ICM of the Hercules A cluster by a factor of ~100. It adds to the case
that AGN outbursts are a significant source of preheating for the ICM. Unless
the mechanical efficiency of the AGN in Hercules A exceeds 10%, the central
black hole must have grown by more than 1.7e8 Msun to power this one outburst.",2005-04-15T14:54:32Z
"Detection and analysis of a new INTEGRAL hard X-ray transient, IGR
  J17285-2922","We present the transient nature of INTEGRAL source IGR J17285-2922,
identified from a single period of activity during an IBIS/ISGRI Galactic
Centre Deep Exposure in September 2003. The source has a maximum detection
significance of 14 sigma in the 20-100 keV energy range and exhibits a flux of
6.5 mCrab before it moves out of the ISGRI field of view. The source is visible
to at least 150 keV and its spectrum can be fit with a power law slope of
Gamma=2.1+/-0.17; a more physical model could not be fit due to poor
statistics. Detected characteristics are consistent with the source being a
Galactic low-mass X-ray binary harbouring a black hole or neutron star.",2005-05-19T13:02:16Z
"High resolution X-ray spectrum of the accreting binary X-ray pulsar GX
  1+4","We present here high resolution X-ray spectrum of the accreting binary X-ray
pulsar GX 1+4 obtained with the High Energy Transmission Grating (HETG)
instrument of the Chandra X-ray Observatory. This was supplemented by a
simultaneous observation with the Proportional Counter Array (PCA) of the Rossi
X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). During this observation, the source was in a
somewhat low intensity state and the pulse profile with both Chandra and RXTE
shows a narrow dip, characteristic of GX 1+4 in medium and low intensity
states. The continuum X-ray spectrum obtained with the HETG and PCA can be
fitted well with a high energy cutoff power-law model with line of sight
absorption. Interestingly, we find that this low state is accompanied by a
relatively small absorption column density. A 6.4 keV narrow emission line with
an equivalent width of 70 eV is clearly detected in the HETG spectrum. The
fluorescence iron line, or at least part of it is produced in the neutral or
lowly ionized iron in the circumstellar material that also causes most of the
line of sight absorption. In the HETG spectrum, we have found evidence for a
weak (equivalent width ~30 eV) emission line at 6.95 keV. This line is
identified as Ly_alpha emission line from hydrogen-like iron and the spectrum
does not show emission lines from helium-like iron. We discuss various emission
regions for the hydrogen-like iron emission line, like gas diffused into the
Alfven sphere or an accretion curtain flowing from the inner accretion disk to
the magnetic poles.",2005-03-24T12:11:33Z
"A library of high resolution synthetic stellar spectra from 300nm to 1.8
  micron with solar and alpha-enhanced composition","Libraries of stellar spectra are fundamental tools for the study of stellar
populations and both empirical and synthetic libraries have been used for this
purpose. In this paper, a new library of high resolution synthetic spectra is
presented, ranging from the near-ultraviolet (300nm) to the near-infrared
(1.8${\rm \mu}$m). The library spans all the stellar types that are relevant to
the integrated light of old and intermediate-age stellar populations in the
involved spectral region (spectral types F through M and all luminosity
classes). The grid was computed for metallicities ranging from [Fe/H] = --2.5
to +0.5, including both solar and $\alpha$-enhanced ([$\alpha$/Fe] = 0.4)
chemical compositions. The synthetic spectra are a good match to observations
of stars throughout the stellar parameter space encompassed by the library and
over the whole spectral region covered by the computations.",2005-05-25T13:56:38Z
Spin-Dependent Cyclotron Decay Rates in Strong Magnetic Fields,"Cyclotron decay and absorption rates have been well studied in the
literature, focusing primarily on spectral, angular and polarization
dependence. Astrophysical applications usually do not require retention of
information on the electron spin state, and these are normally averaged in
obtaining the requisite rates. In magnetic fields, higher order quantum
processes such as Compton scattering become resonant at the cyclotron frequency
and its harmonics, with the resonances being formally divergent. Such
divergences are usually eliminated by accounting for the finite lifetimes of
excited Landau states. This practice requires the use of spin-dependent
cyclotron rates in order to obtain accurate determinations of process rates
very near cyclotronic resonances, the phase space domain most relevant for
certain applications to pulsar models. This paper develops previous results in
the literature to obtain compact analytic expressions for cyclotron decay
rates/widths in terms of a series of Legendre functions of the second kind;
these expressions can be expediently used in astrophysical models. The rates
are derived using two popular eigenstate formalisms, namely that due to Sokolov
and Ternov, and that due to Johnson and Lippmann. These constitute two sets of
eigenfunctions of the Dirac equation that diagonalize different operators, and
accordingly yield different spin-dependent cyclotron rates. This paper
illustrates the attractive Lorentz transformation characteristics of the
Sokolov and Ternov formulation, which is another reason why it is preferable
when electron spin information must be explicitly retained.",2005-05-16T17:49:42Z
"RR Lyrae variables in Galactic globular clusters V. The case of M3
  pulsators","We use our synthetic Horizontal Branch (HB) procedure to approach the debated
problem concerning the adequacy of canonical HB stellar models to account for
the observed peaked distribution of RR Lyrae fundamentalised periods in the
globular cluster M3. We find that by assuming a suitable bimodal mass
distribution, canonical models account for the observed period distribution. In
particular, the best fit model, out of nine random extractions, reaches a 99.9%
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) probability. We also attempt a prediction of the
relative distribution of variables in fundamental and first overtone pulsators,
reaching a rather satisfactory agreement. However, one finds that canonical
models outnumber by roughly a factor of two the observed number of red HB
stars. Possible solutions for this discrepancy are outlined. Alternative
evolutionary scenarios are also briefly discussed.",2005-04-21T13:59:47Z
Search for muon enhancement at sea level from transient solar activity,"This paper presents first results of an ongoing study of a possible
association between muon enhancements at ground observed by the TUPI telescope
and transient events such as the Sun's X-ray activity. The analysis of the
observed phenomenon by using the GOES satellite archive data seems to indicate
that on most cases the Ground Level Enhancements (GLEs) could potentially be
associated with solar flares. We show that small scale solar flares, those with
prompt X-ray emission classified as C class (power above $10^{-6}Watts m^{-2}$
at 1 AU) may give rise to GLEs, probably associated with solar protons and ions
arriving to the Earth as a coherent particle pulse. The TUPI telescope's high
performance with these energetic solar particles arises mainly from: (1) its
high counting rate (up to $\sim 100$ KHz). This value in most cases is around
100 times higher than other detectors at ground and (2) due to its tracking
system. The telescope is always looking near the direction of the IMF lines.
The GLE's delay in relation of the X-ray prompt emission suggest that shock
driven by corona mass ejection (CME) is an essential requirement for the
particle acceleration efficiency.",2005-04-28T17:59:57Z
"Outflowing material in the CSS quasar 3C48: evidence of jet-cloud
  interaction?","We report the detection of a zabs=0.3654 associated absorption-line system in
the UV spectrum of the CSS quasar 3C48. The absorbing material is blue shifted
with respect to the quasar emission-line redshift, zem=0.3700, suggesting an
outflow velocity of ~1000 km/s. We detect absorption lines over a range of
ionization states from Ly-beta, Ly-gamma, CIV, NIV, SVI to OVI and possibly OIV
and NeVIII. The kinematical properties of the absorption-line system are
similar to the blue-shifted emission line gas seen in [OIII]\lambda5007
(Chatzichristou, Vanderriest & Jaffe 1999), which is believed to have
interacted with the radio jet. We study the properties of the absorbing
material using CLOUDY and find that photoionization models with Solar abundance
ratios (with overall metallicity in the range 0.1<Z/Z$_\odot$<1.3) are enough
to explain the observed column densities of all the species except NeVIII,
detection of which requires confirmation. Since the cooling and recombination
time for the gas is ~10^5 yr, the consistency with the photoionization models
suggests that any possible interaction of absorbing material with the jet must
have taken place before ~10^5 yr. The abundance ratio of nitrogen to carbon is
close to Solar values, unlike in the case of most quasars, especially at
high-redshifts, which have super-Solar values. We observed 3C48 with the Giant
Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) to search for redshifted 21cm HI absorption.
However, we did not detect any significant feature in our spectra and estimate
the 3-sigma upper limit to the optical depth to be in the range 0.001 to 0.003.
However, due to the diffuse nature of the radio source, optical depths as high
as 0.1 towards individual knots or compact components cannot be ruled out.",2005-05-06T12:57:43Z
"Precision measurement of cosmic magnification from 21 cm emitting
  galaxies","We show how precision lensing measurements can be obtained through the
lensing magnification effect in high redshift 21cm emission from galaxies.
Normally, cosmic magnification measurements have been seriously complicated by
galaxy clustering. With precise redshifts obtained from 21cm emission line
wavelength, one can correlate galaxies at different source planes, or exclude
close pairs to eliminate such contaminations.
  We provide forecasts for future surveys, specifically the SKA and CLAR. SKA
can achieve percent precision on the dark matter power spectrum and the galaxy
dark matter cross correlation power spectrum, while CLAR can measure an
accurate cross correlation power spectrum. The neutral hydrogen fraction was
most likely significantly higher at high redshifts, which improves the number
of observed galaxies significantly, such that also CLAR can measure the dark
matter lensing power spectrum. SKA can also allow precise measurement of
lensing bispectrum.",2005-04-25T18:36:37Z
ROMA: a map-making algorithm for polarised CMB data sets,"We present ROMA, a parallel code to produce joint optimal temperature and

CMB Anisotropy Due to Tangled magnetic fields in re-ionized models,"Primordial tangled cosmological Magnetic Fields source rotational velocity
perturbations of the baryon fluid, even in the post-recombination universe.
These vortical modes inturn leave a characteristic imprint on the temperature
anisotropy of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), if the CMB photons can be
re-scatterred after recombination. Observations from WMAP indicate that the
Universe underwent a relatively early re-ionization ($z_{ri} \sim 15$), which
does indeed lead to a significant optical depth for re-scattering of CMB
photons after the re-ionization epoch. We compute the resulting additional
temperature anisotropies, induced by primordial magnetic fields in the
post-recombination universe. We show that in models with early re-ionization, a
nearly scale-invariant spectrum of tangled magnetic fields which redshift to a
present value of $B_0 \sim 3 \times 10^{-9}$ Gauss, produce vector mode
perturbations which in turn induce additional temperature anisotropy of about
0.3 to 0.4 $ \mu$K over very small angular scales, with $ l$ upto $\sim 10000 $
or so.",2005-04-01T02:05:44Z
Red clump distances to the inner Galactic structures,"The least well known structure of the Galaxy is its central region, because
of the high extinction, the crowding and the confusion between disk and bulge
sources along the line of sight. We show how the structure of the inner Galaxy
and the dust distribution can be strongly constrained by using red clump stars
as distance indicator. The results of this method applied on the deep
near-infrared survey of the inner Galactic bulge made with the Cambridge
Infrared Survey Instrument (CIRSI) are presented.",2005-06-17T14:27:15Z
"Experimental N V and Ne VIII low-temperature dielectronic recombination
  rate coefficients","The dielectronic recombination rate coefficients of N V and Ne VIII ions have
been measured at a heavy-ion storage ring. The investigated energy ranges
covered all dielectronic recombination resonances attached to 2s -> 2p (Delta
n=0) core excitations. The rate coefficients in a plasma are derived and
parameterized by using a convenient fit formula. The experimentally derived
rate coefficients are compared with theoretical data by Colgan et al. (2004,
A&A, 417, 1183) and Nahar & Pradhan (1997, ApJ, 111, 339) as well as with the
recommended rate coefficients by Mazzotta et al. (1998, A&A, 133, 403). The
data of Colgan et al. and Nahar & Pradhan reproduce the experiment very well
over the temperature ranges where N V and Ne VIII are expected to exist in
photoionized as well as in collisionally ionized plasmas. In contrast, the
recommendation of Mazzotta et al. agrees with the experimental rate coefficient
only in the temperature range of collisional ionization. At lower temperatures
it deviates from the measured rate coefficient by orders of magnitude. In
addition the influence of external electric fields with field strengths up to
1300 V/cm on the dielectronic recombination rate coefficient has been
investigated.",2005-03-09T16:03:38Z
"Limits on Turbulent HI Fluctuations Towards PSR B0329+54 On Scales
  Between 0.0025 and 12.5 AU","We have measured the HI absorption towards pulsar B0329+54 using the Green
Bank Telescope during 18 epochs between 2002 June 30 and 2003 October 10. Three
observing epochs consisted of a continuous period of 20 hours each, while
fifteen epochs were 1-2 hours each. We calculate the structure function of HI
absorption variations toward the pulsar on time scales of 10 minutes to 16
months which, using the proper motion of 95 km/s and the parallactic distance
of 1.03 kpc measured towards B0329+54 (Brisken et al. 2002), corresponds to
angular scales of 0.37 micro-arcseconds to 23.8 milli-arseconds and samples
structures between 0.0025-12.5 AU assuming HI gas half way to the pulsar and
ignoring scintillation effects. We find no evidence for any turbulent HI
absorption fluctuations towards B0329+54, with the following upper limits on
the change in opacity for various absorption features: 0.026 at -31, -21, -18,
and +4 km/s, 0.12 at -11 km/s, and 0.055 at -1 km/s.",2005-06-02T04:31:57Z
"Strong dust processing in circumstellar discs around 6 RV Tauri stars.
  Are dusty RV Tauri stars all binaries?","We present extended Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) of seven classical
RV Tauri stars, using newly obtained submillimetre continuum measurements and
Geneva optical photometry supplemented with literature data. The broad-band
SEDs show a large IR excess with a black-body slope at long wavelengths in six
of the seven stars, R Sct being the noticeable exception. This long wavelength
slope is best explained assuming the presence of a dust component of large
grains in the circumstellar material. We show that the most likely distribution
of the circumstellar dust around the six systems is that the dust resides in a
disc. Moreover, very small outflow velocities are needed to explain the
presence of dust near the sublimation temperature and we speculate that the
discs are Keplerian. The structure and evolution of these compact discs are as
yet not understood but a likely prerequisite for their formation is that the
dusty RV Tauri stars are binaries.",2005-03-14T11:28:09Z
"The discovery of an extreme jet in Rosette that shedding light on the
  formation of free-floating brown dwarfs and giant planets","We report on the discovery of an optical jet with a striking morphology in
the Rosette Nebula. It could be the most extreme case known of an accretion
disk and jet system directly exposed to strong ionization fields that impose
strong effects on its disk evolution. Unlike typical optical flows, this jet
system is found to have a high excitation nature mainly due to disruptive
interaction with the violent environment. As a result, the extension of the
highly-collimated jet and possible former episodes of the degenerated
counterjet all show bow-shocked structures. Our results provide implications on
how incipience of massive stars in giant molecular clouds prevents further
generations of low-mass star formation, and offers an evolutionary solution on
how isolated substellar/planetary mass objects in regions of massive star
formation are formed.",2005-04-01T02:48:56Z
Issues with Core-Collapse Supernova Progenitor Models,"The status of core collapse supernoova progenitor models is reviewed with a
focus on some of the current uncertainties arising from the difficulties of
modeling important macrophysics and microphysics. In particular, I look at
issues concerned with modeling convection, the implications of the still
uncertain 12C(alpha,gamma)16O reaction rate, the uncertainties involved with
the incorporation of mass loss, rotation, and magnetic fields in the stellar
models, and the possible generation of global instabilities in stellar models

A Puzzling Merger in A3266: the Hydrodynamic Picture from XMM-Newton,"Using the mosaic of nine XMM-Newton observations, we study the hydrodynamic
state of the merging cluster of galaxies Abell 3266. The high quality of the
spectroscopic data and large field of view of XMM-Netwon allow us to determine
the thermodynamic conditions of the intracluster medium on scales of order of
50 kpc. A high quality entropy map reveals the presence of an extended region
of low entropy gas, running from the primary cluster core toward the northeast
along the nominal merger axis. The mass of the low entropy gas amounts to
approximately 2e13 solar masses, which is comparable to the baryonic mass of
the core of a rich cluster. We test the possibility that the origin of the
observed low entropy gas is either related to the disruption a preexisting
cooling core in Abell 3266 or to the stripping of gas from an infalling
subcluster companion. We find that both the radial pressure and entropy
profiles as well as the iron abundance of Abell 3266 do not resemble those in
other known cooling core clusters (Abell 478). Thus we conclude that the low
entropy region is subcluster gas in the process of being stripped off from its
dark matter halo. In this scenario the subcluster would be falling onto the
core of A3266 from the foreground. This would also help interpret the observed
high velocity dispersion of the galaxies in the cluster center, provided that
the mass of the subcluster is at most a tenth of the mass of the main cluster.",2005-05-02T20:02:42Z
Stochastic approaches to inflation model building,"While inflation gives an appealing explanation of observed cosmological data,
there are a wide range of different inflation models, providing differing
predictions for the initial perturbations. Typically models are motivated
either by fundamental physics considerations or by simplicity. An alternative
is to generate large numbers of models via a random generation process, such as
the flow equations approach. The flow equations approach is known to predict a
definite structure to the observational predictions. In this paper, we first
demonstrate a more efficient implementation of the flow equations exploiting an
analytic solution found by Liddle (2003). We then consider alternative
stochastic methods of generating large numbers of inflation models, with the
aim of testing whether the structures generated by the flow equations are
robust. We find that while typically there remains some concentration of points
in the observable plane under the different methods, there is significant
variation in the predictions amongst the methods considered.",2005-02-17T21:01:12Z

"Simultaneous ram pressure and tidal stripping; how dwarf spheroidals
  lost their gas","We perform high-resolution N-Body+SPH simulations of gas-rich dwarf galaxy
satellites orbiting within a Milky Way-sized halo and study for the first time
the combined effects of tides and ram pressure. The structure of the galaxy
models and the orbital configurations are chosen in accordance to those
expected in a LCDM Universe.While tidal stirring of disky dwarfs produces
objects whose stellar structure and kinematics resembles that of dwarf
spheroidals after a few orbits, ram pressure stripping is needed to entirely
remove their gas component. Gravitational tides can aid ram pressure stripping
by diminishing the overall potential of the dwarf, but tides also induce bar
formation which funnels gas inwards making subsequent stripping more difficult.
This inflow is particularly effective when the gas can cool radiatively.
Assuming a low density of the hot Galactic corona consistent with observational
constraints, dwarfs with V_{peak} < 30 km/s can be completely stripped of their
gas content on orbits with pericenters of 50 kpc or less. Instead, dwarfs with
more massive dark haloes and V_{peak} > 30 km/s lose most or all of their gas
content only if a heating source keeps the gas extended, partially
counteracting the bar-driven inflow. We show that the ionizing radiation from
the cosmic UV background at z > 2 can provide the required heating. In these
objects most of the gas is removed or becomes ionized at the first pericenter
passage,explaining the early truncation of the star formation observed in Draco
and Ursa Minor. The stripped gas breaks up into individual clouds pressure
confined by the outer gaseous medium that have masses, sizes and densities
comparable to the HI clouds recently discovered around M31.(abridged)",2005-04-13T19:56:24Z
QPOs in Cataclysmic Variables and in X-ray Binaries,"Recent observations, reported by Warner and Woudt, of Dwarf Nova Oscillations
(DNOs) exhibiting frequency drift, period doubling, and 1:2:3 harmonic
structure, can be understood as disc oscillations that are excited by
perturbations at the spin frequency of the white dwarf or of its equatorial
layers. Similar quasi-periodic disc oscillations in black hole low-mass X-ray
binary (LMXB) transients in a 2:3 frequency ratio show no evidence of frequency
drift and correspond to two separate modes of disc oscillation excited by an
internal resonance. Just as no effects of general relativity play a role in
white dwarf DNOs, no stellar surface or magnetic field effects need be invoked
to explain the black hole QPOs.",2005-03-07T15:31:31Z
"Evidence for Radio Detection of Extensive Air Showers Induced by Ultra
  High Energy Cosmic Rays","Firm evidence for a radio emission counterpart of cosmic ray air showers is
presented. By the use of an antenna array set up in coincidence with ground
particle detectors, we find a collection of events for which both time and
arrival direction coincidences between particle and radio signals are observed.
The counting rate corresponds to shower energies $\gtrsim 5\times 10^{16}$ eV.
These results open overwhelming perspectives to complete existing detection
methods for the observation of ultra high-energy cosmic rays.",2005-04-11T13:59:54Z
The Spectral Energy Distribution of CO lines in M82,"We present an analysis of the excitation conditions of the molecular gas in
the streamers and the outflow of M82 based on observations obtained at the IRAM
30m telescope. Our analysis of J=1-0 and J=2-1 transitions of CO and 13CO and
the CO(3-2) line in 13 regions outside the central starburst disk shows that
the gas density within the streamer/outflow system is about an orderof
magnitude lower (n(H2) ~ 10^3 cm^-3) than in the central molecular disk. We
have used an LVG model and data from the literature to constrain the flux
density in each CO transition (the `CO line SED') arising from the
streamer/outflow system and the central starburst disk itself. Globally, we
find that the CO flux density up to the J=3-2 line is dominated by the diffuse
outer regions while lines above the J=5-4 transition are almost exclusively
emitted by the central starburst disk. We compare the CO line SED of M82 to CO
observations of galaxies at high redshift and suggest that small high-J/low-J
CO flux density ratios (observed in some of these sources) are not necessarily
caused by a different excitation of the central molecular gas concentration,
but may result from an additional, more extended and diffuse gas reservoir
around these systems, reminiscent of the situation in M82.",2005-04-18T08:47:57Z
"Point-like gamma ray sources as signatures of distant accelerators of
  ultra high energy cosmic rays","We discuss the possibility of observing distant accelerators of ultra high
energy cosmic rays in synchrotron gamma rays. Protons propagating away from
their acceleration sites produce extremely energetic electrons during
photo-pion interactions with cosmic microwave background photons. If the
accelerator is embedded in a magnetized region, these electrons will emit high
energy synchrotron radiation. The resulting synchrotron source is expected to
be point-like and detectable in the GeV-TeV energy range if the magnetic field
is at the nanoGauss level.",2005-05-22T14:44:33Z
"Third-order perturbative solutions in the Lagrangian perturbation theory

simplest case.",2005-02-11T00:27:37Z
"Maximum elastic deformations of compact stars with exotic equations of
  state","I make the first estimates of maximum elastic quadrupole deformations
sustainable by alternatives to conventional neutron stars. Solid strange quark
stars might sustain maximum ellipticities (dimensionless quadrupoles) up to a
few times $10^{-4}$ rather than a few times $10^{-7}$ for conventional neutron
stars, and hybrid quark-baryon or meson-condensate stars might sustain up to
$10^{-5}$. Most of the difference is due to the shear modulus, which can be up
to $10^{33}$ erg/cm$^3$ rather than $10^{30}$ erg/cm$^3$ in the inner crust of
a conventional neutron star. Maximum solid strange star ellipticities are
comparable to upper limits obtained for several known pulsars in a recent
gravitational-wave search by LIGO. Maximum ellipticities of the more robust
hybrid model will be detectable by LIGO at initial design sensitivity. A large
shear modulus also strengthens the case for starquakes as an explanation for
frequent pulsar glitches.",2005-03-17T20:36:21Z
Cooling and Clusters: When Is Heating Needed?,"There are (at least) two unsolved problems concerning the current state of
the thermal gas in clusters of galaxies. The first is identifying the source of
the heating which offsets cooling in the centers of clusters with short cooling
times (the ``cooling flow'' problem). The second is understanding the mechanism
which boosts the entropy in cluster and group gas. Since both of these problems
involve an unknown source of heating it is tempting to identify them with the
same process, particular since AGN heating is observed to be operating at some
level in a sample of well-observed ``cooling flow'' clusters. Here we show,
using numerical simulations of cluster formation, that much of the gas ending
up in clusters cools at high redshift and so the heating is also needed at
high-redshift, well before the cluster forms. This indicates that the same
process operating to solve the cooling flow problem may not also resolve the
cluster entropy problem.",2005-02-22T16:43:36Z
Intermediate-mass Black Hole and stellar orbits in the Galactic Center,"Many young stars reside within the central half-parsec from SgrA*, the
supermassive black hole in the Galactic Center. The origin of these stars
remains a puzzle. Recently, Hansen and Milosavljevic (2003, HM) have argued
that an Intermediate-Mass Black Hole (IMBH) could have delivered the young
stars to the immediate vicinity of SgrA*. Here we focus on the final stages of
the HM scenario. Namely, we integrate numerically the orbits of stars which are
initially bound to the IMBH, but are stripped from it by the tidal field of
SgrA*. Our numerical algorithm is a symplectic integrator designed specifically
for the problem at hand; however, we have checked our results with SYMBA, a
version of the widely available SWIFT code. We find that the distribution of
the post-inspiral orbital parameters is sensitive to the eccentricity of the
inspiraling IMBH. If the IMBH is on a circular orbit, then the inclinations of
numerically computed orbits relative to the inspiral plane are almost always
smaller than 10 degrees, and therefore (a) the simulations are in good
agreement with the observed motions of stars in a clockwise-moving stellar
disc, (b) the simulations never reproduce the orbits of stars outside this
disc, which include those in the second thick ring of stars and the randomly
oriented unrelaxed orbits of some of the S-stars. If the IMBH's orbital
eccentricity is e=0.6, then approximately half of the stars end up with orbital
inclinations below 10 degrees, and another half have inclinations anywhere
between 0 and 180 degrees; this is somewhat closer to what's observed. We also
show that if IRS13 cluster is bound by an IMBH, as has been argued by Maillard
et. al. 2004, then the same IMBH could not have delivered all of the young
stars to their present location.",2005-02-07T16:50:00Z
The lives and deaths of positrons in the interstellar medium,"We reexamine in detail the various processes undergone by positrons in the
ISM from their birth to their annihilation using the most recent results of
positron interaction cross sections with H, H2 and He. The positrons' lives are
divided into two phases: the 'in-flight' phase and the thermal phase. The first
phase is treated with a Monte Carlo simulation that allows us to determine the
fraction of positrons that form positronium and annihilate as well as the
characteristics of the annihilation emission as a function of the medium
conditions. The second phase is treated with a binary reaction rate approach,
with cross sections adopted from experimental measurement or theoretical
calculations. An extensive search and update of the knowledge of positron
processes was thus undertaken. New reaction rates and line widths have been
obtained. We investigate the treatment of the complicated interactions between
positrons and interstellar dust grains. New reaction rates and widths of the
line resulting from the annihilation inside and outside of the grain have been
obtained. The final results of our calculations showed that dust is only
important in the hot phase of the ISM, where it dominates all other processes.
Combining the new calculations, we have constructed annihilation spectra for
each phase of the ISM, considering various grain contents, as well as an
overall combined spectrum for the ISM as a whole.",2005-04-07T18:37:05Z
Regularized energy-dependent solar flare hard x-ray spectral index,"The deduction from solar flare X-ray photon spectroscopic data of the energy
dependent model-independent spectral index is considered as an inverse problem.
Using the well developed regularization approach we analyze the energy
dependency of spectral index for a high resolution energy spectrum provided by
Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). The regularization
technique produces much smoother derivatives while avoiding additional errors
typical of finite differences. It is shown that observations imply a spectral
index varying significantly with energy, in a way that also varies with time as
the flare progresses. The implications of these findings are discussed in the
solar flare context.",2005-06-05T18:22:56Z
"The oscillation effects on thermalization of the neutrinos in the
  universe with low reheating temperature","We study how the oscillations of the neutrinos affect their thermalization
process during the reheating period with temperature O(1) MeV in the early
universe. We follow the evolution of the neutrino density matrices and
investigate how the predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis vary with the
reheating temperature. For the reheating temperature of several MeV, we find
that including the oscillations makes different predictions, especially for
$^4$He abundance. Also, the effects on the lower bound of the reheating
temperature from cosmological observations are discussed.",2005-05-19T07:26:54Z
"Modulation of a Chirp Gravitational Wave from a Compact Binary due to
  Gravitational Lensing","A possible wave effect in the gravitational lensing phenomenon is discussed.
We consider the interference of two coherent gravitational waves of slightly
different frequencies from a compact binary, due to the gravitational lensing
by a galaxy halo. This system shows the modulation of the wave amplitude. The
lensing probability of such the phenomenon is of order 10^{-5} for a high-z
source, but it may be advantageous to the observation due to the magnification
of the amplitude.",2005-05-06T07:24:47Z
Cosmology under Milne's shadow,"Based on the magnitude--redshift diagram for the sample of supernovae Ia
analysed by Perlmutter et al. (1999), Davis & Lineweaver rule out the special
relativistic interpretation of cosmological redshifts at a confidence level of
23 sigma. Here, we critically reassess this result. Special relativity is known
to describe the dynamics of an empty universe, by means of the Milne kinematic
model. Applying only special-relativistic concepts, we derive the angular
diameter distance and the luminosity distance in the Milne model. In
particular, in this model we do not use the underlying metric in its
Robertson-Walker form, so our exposition is useful for readers without any
knowledge of general relativity. We do however, explicitly use the
special-relativistic Doppler formula for redshift. We apply the derived
luminosity distance to the magnitude--redshift diagram for supernovae Ia of
Perlmutter et al. (1999) and show that special relativity fits the data much
better than that claimed by Davis & Lineweaver. Specifically, using these data
alone, the Milne model is ruled out only at a 2 sigma level. Although not a
viable cosmological model, in the context of current research on supernovae Ia
it remains a useful reference model when comparing predictions of various
cosmological models.",2005-03-31T10:37:50Z

arrays are presented. From $0^{\circ}$ to $60^{\circ}$ in declination,
significant excesses from the well-known steady source Crab Nebula and the high
state of the flare type source Markarian 421 are observed. Because the levels
of significance from other positions are not sufficiently high, 90% confidence
level upper limits on the flux are set assuming different power law spectra. To

work.",2005-02-02T14:41:46Z
"Three XMM-Newton observations of the Anomalous X-ray Pulsar 1E
  1048.1-5937: long term variations in spectrum and pulsed fraction","We report the results of a recent (July 2004) XMM-Newton Target of
Opportunity observation of the Anomalous X-ray pulsar 1E 1048.1-5937, together
with a detailed re-analysis of previous observations carried out in 2000 and
2003. In July 2004 the source had a 2-10 keV flux of 6.2$\times10^{-12}$ erg
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and a pulsed fraction P$_F$=0.68. The comparison of the
three data sets shows the presence of an anti-correlation between flux and
pulsed fraction, implying that previous estimates of the source energetics
based on the assumption of a large and constant pulsed fraction might be
significantly underestimated. The source spectrum is well described by a power
law plus blackbody model (kT~0.63 keV, photon index $\Gamma$~2.7-3.5) or,
alternatively, by the sum of two blackbodies of which the hotter is Comptonized
by relativistic electrons. In this case the temperatures are kT${_1}$~0.2-0.3
keV and kT${_2}$~0.4-0.5 keV and the emitting area of the cooler component is
consistent with the whole neutron star surface. The long term luminosity
variation of a factor >~2 is accompanied by relatively small variations in the
spectral shape. Phase resolved spectroscopy indicates a harder spectrum in
correspondence of the pulse maximum. No spectral features have been detected
with 4$\sigma$ limits on the equivalent width in the range ~10-220 eV,
depending on line energy and width.",2005-03-17T14:44:26Z
"Hydrodynamical stability of thin accretion discs: transient growth of
  global axisymmetric perturbations","The purpose of this paper is to explore how accretion discs manifest the
phenomenon of transient growth on a global scale. We investigate analytically
the time response of a thin accretion disc to particular axisymmetric
perturbations. To facilitate an analytical treatment we replace the energy
equation with a general polytropic assumption. The asymptotic expansion of
Klu\'zniak & Kita (2000), which extended the method of Regev (1983) to a full
steady polytropic disc (with $n=3/2$), is further developed and implemented for
both the steady (for any polytropic index) and time-dependent problems. The
spatial form and temporal behaviour of selected dynamical disturbances are
studied in detail. We identify the perturbation space which leads to transient
growth and provide analytical solutions which manifest this expected transient
growth behaviour. Three terms (physical causes) responsible for the appearance
of transient growth are identified. Two depend explicitly on the viscosity
while the third one is relevant also for inviscid discs. The main conclusion we
draw is that the phenomenon of transient growth exists in discs on a global
scale.",2005-02-20T09:28:39Z
Molecular hydrogen formation on grain surfaces,"We reconsider H2 formation on grain surfaces. We develop a rate equation
model which takes into account the presence of both physisorbed and chemisorbed
sites on the surface, including quantum mechanical tunnelling and thermal
diffusion. In this study, we took into consideration the uncertainties on the
characteristics of graphitic surfaces. We calculate the H2 formation efficiency
with the Langmuir Hinshelwood and Eley Rideal mechanisms, and discuss the
importance of these mechanisms for a wide range of grain and gas temperatures.
We also develop a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the H2 formation
efficiency and compare the results to our rate equation models. Our results are
the following: (1) Depending on the barrier against chemisorption, we predict
the efficiency of H2 formation for a wide range of grain and gas temperatures.
(2) The Eley-Rideal mechanism has an impact on the H2 formation efficiency at
high grain and gas temperatures. (3) The fact that we consider chemisorption in
our model makes the rate equation and Monte Carlo approaches equivalent.",2005-02-15T12:47:25Z
J-resolved He I emission predictions in the low-density limit,"Determinations of the primordial helium abundance are used in precision
cosmological tests. These require highly accurate He I recombination rate
coefficients. Here we reconsider the formation of He I recombination lines in
the low-density limit. This is the simplest case and it forms the basis for the
more complex situation where collisions are important. The formation of a
recombination line is a two-step process, beginning with the capture of a
continuum electron into a bound state and followed by radiative cascade to
ground. The rate coefficient for capture from the continuum is obtained from
photoionization cross sections and detailed balancing, while radiative
transition probabilities determine the cascades. We have made every effort to
use today's best atomic data. Radiative decay rates are from Drake's
variational calculations, which include QED, fine structure, and
singlet-triplet mixing. Certain high-$L$ fine-structure levels do not have a
singlet-triplet distinction and the singlets and triplets are free to mix in
dipole-allowed radiative decays. We use quantum defect or hydrogenic
approximations to include levels higher than those treated in the variational
calculations. [Abstract clipped]",2005-04-04T21:03:36Z
The Halo of the Milky Way,"We show that the star counts in the spheroid of the Milky Way are not
symmetric about the l=0, l=180 deg. plane. The minimum counts are found towards
l=155 deg. The Galactic longitude of maximum star counts depends on the
magnitude and color selection of the halo stars. We interpret this as evidence
that the spheroid population is triaxial with a major axis oriented 65 deg from
the line of sight from the Sun to the Galactic center, and approximately
perpendicular to the Galactic bar. Large local star concentrations from tidal
debris and possible tidal debris are also observed. A full understanding of the
Galactic spheroid population awaits position information and three dimensional
space velocities for a representative set of stars in every substructure.
Tangential velocities for many stars will be provided by current and planned
astrometry missions, but no planned mission will measure stars faint enough to
unravel the more distant parts of the spheroid, which contain the majority of
the spatial substructure. This paper uses data from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) public data release DR3.",2005-02-18T21:48:08Z
Phenomenology of cosmic ray air showers,"The properties of cosmic rays with energies above 1PeV have to be deduced
from the spacetime structure and particle content of the air showers which they
initiate. In this review, a summary of the phenomenology of these giant air
showers is presented. We describe the hadronic interaction models used to
extrapolate results from collider data to ultra high energies, an also the main
electromagnetic processes that govern the longitudinal shower evolution as well
as the lateral spread of particles.",2005-05-30T18:01:12Z
Pulsating stars in the ASAS-3 database. I. Beta Cephei stars,"We present results of an analysis of the ASAS-3 data for short-period
variables from the recently published catalogue of over 38 000 stars. Using the
data available in the literature we verify the results of the automatic
classification related to $\beta$ Cephei pulsators. In particular, we find that
14 stars in the catalogue can be classified unambiguously as new $\beta$ Cephei
stars. By means of periodogram analysis we derive the frequencies and
amplitudes of the excited modes. The main modes in the new $\beta$ Cephei stars
have large semi-amplitudes, between 35 and 80 mmag. Up to four modes were found
in some stars. Two (maybe three) new $\beta$ Cephei stars are members of
southern young open clusters: ASAS 164409-4719.1 belongs to NGC 6200, ASAS
164630-4701.2 is a member of Hogg 22, and ASAS 164939-4431.7 could be a member
of NGC 6216.
  We also analyze the photometry of four known $\beta$ Cephei stars in the
ASAS-3 catalogue, namely IL Vel, NSV 24078, V1449 Aql and SY Equ. Finally, we
discuss the distribution of $\beta$ Cephei stars in the Galaxy.",2005-06-14T17:12:02Z
A new method to search for a cosmic ray dipole anisotropy,"We propose a new method to determine the dipole (and quadrupole) component of
a distribution of cosmic ray arrival directions, which can be applied when
there is partial sky coverage and/or inhomogeneous exposure. In its simplest
version it requires that the exposure only depends on the declination, but it
can be easily extended to the case of a small amplitude modulation in right
ascension. The method essentially combines a $\chi^2$ minimization of the
distribution in declination to obtain the multipolar components along the
North-South axis and a harmonic Rayleigh analysis for the components involving
the right ascension direction.",2005-04-28T13:22:52Z
"Turbulence driven by outflow-blown cavities in the molecular cloud of
  NGC 1333","Outflows from young stellar objects have been identified as a possible source
of turbulence in molecular clouds. To investigate the relationship between
outflows, cloud dynamics and turbulence, we compare the kinematics of the
molecular gas associated with NGC 1333, traced in 13CO(1-0), with the
distribution of young stellar objects (YSOs) within. We find a velocity
dispersion of ~ 1-1.6 km/s in 13CO that does not significantly vary across the
cloud, and is uncorrelated with the number of nearby young stellar outflows
identified from optical and submillimeter observations. However, from velocity
channel maps we identify about 20 cavities or depressions in the 13CO intensity
of scales > 0.1-0.2 pc and velocity widths 1-3 km/s. The cavities exhibit limb
brightened rims in both individual velocity channel maps and position velocity
diagrams, suggesting that they are slowly expanding. We interpret these
cavities to be remnants of past YSO outflow activity: If these cavities are
presently empty, they would fill in on time scales of a million years. This can
exceed the lifetime of a YSO outflow phase, or the transit time of the central
star through the cavity, explaining the the absence of any clear correlation
between the cavities and YSO outflows. We find that the momentum and energy
deposition associated with the expansion of the cavities is sufficient to power
the turbulence in the cloud. In this way we conclude that the cavities are an
important intermediary step between the conversion of YSO outflow energy and
momentum into cloud turbulent motions.",2005-03-07T22:32:38Z
Precise reddening and metallicity of NGC6752 from FLAMES spectra,"(abridged) Accurate reddenings for Globular Clusters could be obtained by
comparing the colour-temperature obtained using temperatures from
reddening-free indicator (Halpha), with that given by standard
colour-temperature calibrations. From a single 1300 seconds exposure with
FLAMES at VLT2 we obtained spectra centred on Halpha (R=6000, 5<S/N<50) for 120
stars near the turn-off of NGC6752. This set of spectra was used to derive
effective temperatures from fittings of Halpha profiles with typical errors of
about +/- 200 K and reddening estimates with individual errors of 0.05 mag.
Averaging all individual reddenings, a high precision reddening estimate has
been obtained for the cluster: E(B-V)=0.046 +/- 0.005. The same exposure
provided UVES spectra of seven stars near the red giant branch bump (R=40000,
20<S/N<40) that provided Fe abundances with internal errors of 0.026 dex, and
with average metallicity [Fe/H]= -1.48 +/- 0.01 +/- 0.06 dex (random +
systematic). Abundances were obtained for several other elements, allowing e.g.
an accurate estimate of the ratio between the alpha-elements and Fe
([alpha/Fe]=+0.27 +/- 0.01). The O-Na anticorrelation is evident from our UVES
data, in agreement with past results. This analysis shows the power of FLAMES
for analysis of globular clusters: the accurate reddenings and metal abundances
obtained by a procedure like that described here, combined with distance
determinations from cluster dynamics or main sequence fitting, and high quality
colour-magnitude diagrams, could allow derivation of ages with errors below 1
Gyr for individual globular clusters.",2005-05-10T16:35:36Z
Gamma-ray and neutrino emission from misaligned microquasars,"Microquasars are accreting X-ray binary systems with non-thermal radio jets.
In some of these systems the jet is expected to be strongly misaligned with the
perpendicular to the orbital plane. If the donor star is an early-type star,
the jet could collide with the stellar wind producing a standing shock between
the compact object and the stellar surface. Relativistic particles injected by
the jet can be re-accelerated and isotropized at the colliding region. If the
jet has hadronic content, TeV protons will diffuse into the inner, dense wind
leading to gamma-ray and neutrino production from interactions with the matter
of the wind. In the case of very powerful jets, the wind pressure can be
overbalanced and the jet might impact directly onto the stellar surface. We
present estimates of the gamma-ray and neutrino luminosities for different sets
of parameters in these scenarios and we briefly discuss the effects of this
radiation on the donor star and its detectability with current instruments.",2005-05-13T15:15:22Z
"A simple test for the existence of two accretion modes in Active
  Galactic Nuclei","By analogy to the different accretion states observed in black-hole X-ray
binaries (BHXBs), it appears plausible that accretion disks in active galactic
nuclei (AGN) undergo a state transition between a radiatively efficient and
inefficient accretion flow. If the radiative efficiency changes at some
critical accretion rate, there will be a change in the distribution of black
hole masses and bolometric luminosities at the corresponding transition
luminosity. To test this prediction, I consider the joint distribution of AGN
black hole masses and bolometric luminosities for a sample taken from the
literature. The small number of objects with low Eddington-scaled accretion
rates mdot < 0.01 and black hole masses Mbh < 10^9 Msun constitutes tentative
evidence for the existence of such a transition in AGN. Selection effects, in
particular those associated with flux-limited samples, systematically exclude
objects in particular regions of the black hole mass-luminosity plane.
Therefore, they require particular attention in the analysis of distributions
of black hole mass, bolometric luminosity, and derived quantities like the
accretion rate. I suggest further observational tests of the BHXB-AGN
unification scheme which are based on the jet domination of the energy output
of BHXBs in the hard state, and on the possible equivalence of BHXB in the very
high (or ""steep power-law"") state showing ejections and efficiently accreting
quasars and radio galaxies with powerful radio jets.",2005-02-20T22:40:12Z
"Broad-band spectra of Cyg X-1 and correlations between spectral
  characteristics","We present the results of spectral analysis of 42 simultaneous broad-band
Ginga--OSSE and RXTE--OSSE observations of Cyg X-1 carried out in 1991 and
1996--1999. The hardest spectra in our sample in the energy range from 3 to
\~1000 keV can be well described by thermal Comptonization model with
reflection from the cold disc, while the rest of the spectra are more complex
and require an additional component below 10 keV. We consider a number of
physically realistic models to describe the shape of the E<10 keV excess. The
additional soft component can result from thermal Comptonization by electrons
with a low Compton parameter, or can be a part of a nonthermal, power-law like
emission extending above 1 MeV. We study correlations between parameters
obtained from the spectral fits with different models. We confirm a general
correlation between the photon index $\Gamma$ and the amplitude of reflection
R. We find that simple phenomenological models (like power-law plus Compton
reflection) applied to the narrow band (3--20 keV) data overestimated the
values of R and $\Gamma$, although the simple models did rank correctly the
spectra according to R and $\Gamma$. The dynamic corona model provides a
satisfactory description of the observed correlation, while the hot inner disc
models have problems in reproducing it quantitatively. We do not find
significant correlation between the electron temperature and other spectral
parameters, while the optical depth of the hot medium seems to decrease when
the spectrum becomes softer. It is also shown that spectral parameters are well
correlated with the timing characteristics of the source.",2005-02-21T17:26:52Z
"Development of Bubble Chambers With Enhanced Stability and Sensitivity
  to Low-Energy Nuclear Recoils","The viability of using a Bubble Chamber for rare event searches and in
particular for the detection of dark matter particle candidates is considered.
Techniques leading to the deactivation of inhomogeneous nucleation centers and
subsequent enhanced stability in such a detector are described. Results from
prototype trials indicate that sensitivity to low-energy nuclear recoils like
those expected from Weakly Interacting Massive Particles can be obtained in
conditions of near total insensitivity to minimum ionizing backgrounds. An
understanding of the response of superheated heavy refrigerants to these
recoils is demonstrated within the context of existing theoretical models. We
comment on the prospects for the detection of supersymmetric dark matter
particles with a large $CF_{3}I$ chamber.",2005-03-17T20:04:31Z
Near and Mid Infrared Observations of Ultracompact HII Regions,"This review discussed near- and mid- infrared observations of ultracompact
(UC) HII regions. The importance of ISO mid-IR fine-structure nebular lines is
emphasised since only a small fraction of UCHII regions are observed directly
in the near-IR. The reliability of contemporary atmospheric models for such
indirect diagnostics is discussed, whilst a revised Spectral Type-Temperature
calibration is presented for Galactic O3 to B3 dwarfs. In particular,
fine-structure line derived properties of G29.96-0.02 differ from the direct
near-IR spectroscopic result and represents a serious discrepancy which needs
to be addressed. Mid-IR MSX and Spitzer imaging permits the identification of
those UCHII regions for which far-IR IRAS fluxes are reliable, relevant to the
single versus cluster nature of individual sources. High spatial resolution
imaging with ground-based 8m telescopes allows more direct tests, as recently
applied to G70.29+1.60. Finally, recent Spitzer mid-IR observations of Giant
HII regions are briefly discussed.",2005-06-14T20:24:51Z
The SuperCDMS Experiment,"WIMP-nucleon cross sections in the range 10^{-46} - 10^{-44} cm^2 may be
probed by a ton-scale experiment with low energy thresholds and excellent
discrimination of backgrounds. Because CDMS ZIP detectors are the most proven
means of achieving such good discrimination, we intend to scale CDMS up to a
ton detector mass. Development of this experiment, dubbed ""SuperCDMS,"" is
discussed. Improved analysis and optimization of the charge collection and
athermal phonon sensors should improve surface-background rejection by over two
orders of magnitude. Siting the SuperCDMS experiment deep enough to remove the
fast neutron background, and reducing radioactive beta contamination near or on
the detectors, should sufficiently reduce these otherwise troubling
backgrounds. The primary challenge is making the experiment easy enough to
build. We discuss methods of improving the detector manufacturability, removing
the need for large-scale cryogenic detector testing, and allowing simplified
infrastructure by using more sophisticated readout.",2005-02-21T21:20:47Z
"Monitoring of the prompt radio emission from the unusual supernova
  2004dj in NGC2403","Supernova 2004dj in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC2403 was detected optically
in July 2004. Peaking at a magnitude of 11.2, this is the brightest supernova
detected for several years. Here we present Multi-Element Radio Linked
Interferometer Network (MERLIN) observations of this source, made over a four
month period, which give a position of R.A. = 07h37m17.044s, Dec
=+65deg35'57.84"" (J2000.0). We also present a well-sampled 5 GHz light curve
covering the period from 5 August to 2 December 2004. With the exception of the
unusual and very close SN 1987A, these observations represent the first
detailed radio light curve for the prompt emission from a Type II-P supernova.",2005-03-08T11:46:38Z
Theoretical modelling of late-type giant atmospheres: preparing for Gaia,"Late type giants (RGB/AGB stars) will be important tracers of the Galactic
morphology and evolution in the framework of Gaia, as they are intrinsically
bright and thus can probe distant stellar populations or those obscured by
interstellar extinction. A realistic representation of their atmospheres and
spectra with stellar atmosphere models is thus of crucial importance, both for
the design and optimization of Gaia instruments, as well as the interpretation
of provided astrophysical data. Our analysis of synthetic photometric colors of
late-type giants based on PHOENIX, MARCS and ATLAS model atmospheres indicates
a general agreement between the current theoretical predictions and
observations in the framework of stationary 1-D model atmospheres. Presently
available models allow temperature determinations of RGB/AGB stars to an
accuracy of ~\pm100 K. In an exploratory study we try to quantify possible
residual systematic effects due to the approximations made in 1-D models using
full 3-D hydrodynamical models. We find that differences in broad-band
photometric colors calculated with 1-D and 3-D models are significant,
translating to the offsets in effective temperature of up to ~70 K. Clearly,
full 3-D hydrodynamical models will help to alleviate such ambiguities in
current theoretical modeling. Additionally, they will allow to study new
phenomena, to open qualitatively new windows for stellar astrophysics in the
Gaia-era.",2005-03-09T10:09:26Z
Long-Term INTEGRAL and RXTE Observations of the X-Ray Pulsar LMC X-4,"We analyze the observations of the X-ray pulsar LMC X-4 performed by the
INTEGRAL observatory and the All-Sky Monitor (ASM) of the RXTE observatory over
a wide energy range. The observed hard X-ray flux from the source is shown to
change by more than a factor of 50 (from ~70 mCrab in the high state to ~1.3
mCrab in the low state) on the time scale of the accretion-disk precession
period, whose mean value for 1996-2004 was determined with a high accuracy,
Pprec=30.275+/-0.004 days. In the low state, a flare about 10 h in duration was
detected from the source; the flux from the source increased by more than a
factor of 4 during this flare. The shape of the pulsar's broadband spectrum is
essentially invariable with its intensity; no statistically significant
features associated with the possible resonance cyclotron absorption line were
found in the spectrum of the source.",2005-04-27T15:09:09Z
"Do observations prove that cosmological neutrinos are thermally
  distributed?","It is usually assumed that relic neutrinos possess a Fermi-Dirac
distribution, acquired during thermal equilibrium in the Early Universe.
However, various mechanisms could introduce strong distortions in this
distribution. We perform a Bayesian likelihood analysis including the first
moments of the three active neutrino distributions as free parameters, and show
that current cosmological observations of light element abundances, Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies and Large Scale Structures (LSS) are
compatible with very large deviations from the standard picture. We also
calculate the bounds on non-thermal distortions which can be expected from
future observations, and stress that CMB and LSS data alone will not be
sensitive enough in order to distinguish between non-thermal distortions in the
neutrino sector and extra relativistic degrees of freedom. This degeneracy
could be removed by additional constraints from primordial nucleosynthesis or
independent neutrino mass scale measurements.",2005-02-22T20:20:50Z
Axial Symmetry and Rotation in the SiO Maser Shell of IK Tauri,"We observed v=1, J=1-0 43-GHz SiO maser emission toward the Mira variable IK
Tauri (IK Tau) using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). The images resulting
from these observations show that SiO masers form a highly elliptical ring of
emission approximately 58 x 32 mas with an axial ratio of 1.8:1. The major axis
of this elliptical distribution is oriented at position angle of ~59 deg. The
line-of-sight velocity structure of the SiO masers has an apparent axis of
symmetry consistent with the elongation axis of the maser distribution.
Relative to the assumed stellar velocity of 35 km/s, the blue- and red-shifted
masers were found to lie to the northwest and southeast of this symmetry axis
respectively. This velocity structure suggests a NW-SE rotation of the SiO
maser shell with an equatorial velocity, which we determine to be ~3.6 km/s.
Such a NW-SE rotation is in agreement with a circumstellar envelope geometry
invoked to explain previous water and OH maser observations. In this geometry,
water and OH masers are preferentially created in a region of enhanced density
along the NE-SW equator orthogonal to the rotation/polar axis suggested by the
SiO maser velocities.",2005-03-08T13:29:04Z
"The initial conditions of isolated star formation - VI. SCUBA mapping of
  prestellar cores","Observations have been carried out with SCUBA at the JCMT of 52 molecular
cloud cores that do not contain any sign of protostellar activity. These are
all therefore candidate prestellar cores, which are believed to represent the
stage of star formation that precedes the formation of a protostar. 29 of the
52 cores were detected at 850 microns at varying levels of signal-to-noise
ratio greater than 3 sigma at peak. The detected cores were split into 'bright'
cores and `intermediate' cores, depending on their peak flux density at 850
microns. Cores with peak 850 microns flux densities greater than 170 mJy/beam
were designated 'bright' (13 cores), while those flux densities below this
value were designated 'intermediate' (16 cores). This dividing line corresponds
to A_v~50 under typical assumptions. The data are combined with our previously
published ISO data, and the physical parameters of the cores, such as density
and temperature, are calculated. Detailed fitting of the bright core radial
profiles shows that they are not critical Bonnor-Ebert spheres, in agreement
with previous findings. However, we find that intermediate cores, such as B68
(which has previously been claimed to be a Bonnor-Ebert sphere), may in fact be
consistent with the Bonnor-Ebert criterion, suggesting perhaps that cores pass
through such a phase during their evolution. We make rough estimates of core
lifetimes based on the statistics of detections and find that the lifetime of a
prestellar core is roughly ~3x10^5 years, while that of a bright core is
\~1.5x10^5 years. Comparisons with some magnetic and turbulence regulated
collapse models show that no model can match all of the data. Models that are
tuned to fit the total prestellar core lifetime, do not predict the relative
numbers of cores seen at each stage.",2005-05-10T12:58:29Z
"Cepheid Calibrations from the Hubble Space Telescope of the Luminosity
  of Two Recent Type Ia Supernovae and a Re-determination of the Hubble
  Constant","We report observations of two nearby Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) for which
observations of Cepheid variables in the host galaxies have been obtained with
the Hubble Space Telescope: SN 1994ae in NGC 3370 and SN 1998aq in NGC 3982.
For NCG 3370, we used the Advanced Camera for Surveys to observe 64 Cepheids
that yield a distance of 29 Mpc, the farthest direct measurement of Cepheids.
We have measured emission lines from H II regions in both host galaxies which
provide metallicity-dependent corrections to their period-luminosity relations.
These two SNe Ia double the sample of ``ideal'' luminosity calibrators: objects
with well-observed and well-calibrated light curves of typical shape and with
low reddening. By comparing them to all similarly well-measured SNe Ia in the
Hubble flow, we find that H_0 = 73 +/- 4 (statistical) +/- 5 (systematic). A
detailed analysis demonstrates that most of the past disagreement over the
value of H_0 as determined from SNe Ia is abated by the replacement of past,
problematic data by more accurate and precise, modern data.",2005-03-07T19:34:35Z
Tracing the Nuclear Accretion History of the Red Galaxy Population,"We investigate the evolution of the hard X-ray luminosity of the red galaxy
population using a large sample of 3316 red galaxies selected over a wide range
in redshift (0.3<z<0.9) from a 1.4 deg^2 region in the Bootes field of the NOAO
Deep Wide-Field Survey (NDWFS). The red galaxies are early-type,
bulge-dominated galaxies and are selected to have the same evolution corrected,
absolute R-band magnitude distribution as a function of redshift to ensure we
are tracing the evolution in the X-ray properties of a comparable optical
population. Using a stacking analysis of 5-ks Chandra/ACIS observations within
this field to study the X-ray emission from these red galaxies in three
redshift bins, we find that the mean X-ray luminosity increases as a function
of redshift. The large mean X-ray luminosity and the hardness of the mean X-ray
spectrum suggests that the X-ray emission is largely dominated by AGN rather
than stellar sources. The hardness ratio can be reproduced by either an
absorbed (N_H ~2 x 10^22 cm^-2) Gamma=1.7 power-law source, consistent with
that of a population of moderately obscured Seyfert-like AGN, or an unabsorbed
Gamma=0.7 source suggesting a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (e.g., an
advection-dominated accretion flow). We also find that the emission from this
sample of red galaxies constitutes at least 5% of the hard X-ray background.
These results suggest a global decline in the mean AGN activity of normal
early-type galaxies from z~1 to the present, which indicates that we are
witnessing the tailing off of the accretion activity onto SMBHs in early-type
galaxies since the quasar epoch.",2005-03-07T18:40:40Z
"Black Hole Formation from Collapsing Dust Fluid in a Background of Dark
  Energy","The gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric star, made of a dust
fluid, $\rho_{DM}$, in a background of dark energy, $p = w\rho,\; (w < -1/3)$,
is studied. It is found that when only dark energy is present, black holes are
{\em never} formed. When both of them are present, black holes can be formed,
due to the condensation of the dust fluid. Initially the dust fluid may not
play an important role, but, as time increases, it will dominate the collapse
and finally leads to formation of black holes. This result remains true even
when the interaction between the dust fluid and dark energy does not vanish.
When $w < -1$ (phantoms), some models can also be interpreted as representing
the death of a white hole that ejects both dust and phantoms. The ejected
matter re-collapses to form a black hole.",2005-05-06T19:52:03Z
The AMIGA project. I. Optical characterization of the CIG catalog,"The AMIGA project (Analysis of the Interstellar Medium of Isolated Galaxies)
is compiling a multiwavelength database of isolated galaxies that includes
optical (B and Halpha), infrared (FIR and NIR) and radio (continuum plus HI and
CO lines) properties. It involves a refinement of the pioneering Catalog of
Isolated Galaxies. This paper is the first in a series and begins with analysis
of the global properties of the nearly redshift-complete CIG with emphasis on
the Optical Luminosity Function (OLF) which we compare with other recent
estimates of the OLF for a variety of environments. The CIG redshift
distribution for n= 956 galaxies re-enforces the evidence for a bimodal
structure seen earlier in smaller samples. The peaks at redshift near 1500 and
6000km/s correspond respectively to galaxies in the local supercluster and
those in more distant large-scale components (particularly Perseus-Pisces). The
two peaks in the redshift distribution are superimposed on 50% or more of the
sample that is distributed in a much more homogeneous way. The CIG probably
represents the most homogeneous local field example that has ever been
compiled. Our derivation of the CIG OLF is consistent with other studies of the
OLF for lower density environments. This comparison via the Schechter parameter
formalization shows that: 1) M* increases with galaxy surface density on the
sky and 2) alpha shows a weaker tendency to do the same. The CIG represents the
largest and most complete foundation for studies of isolated galaxies and is
likely as close as we can come to a field sample. (Tables 1, 2 and 3 are
available in electronic form at http://www.iaa.es/AMIGA.html).",2005-04-08T12:43:43Z
"A Radio Study of the Mouse, G359.23--0.82","The recent detection of a young pulsar powering ``the Mouse'', G359.23--0.82,
as well as detailed imaging of surrounding nebular X-ray emission, have
motivated us to investigate the structural details and polarization
characteristics of the radio emission from this axisymmetric source with a
supersonic bow shock. Using polarization data at 3.6 and 6cm, we find that the
magnetic field wraps around the bow shock structure near the apex of the
system, but downnstream runs parallel to the inferred direction of the pulsar's
motion. The rotation measure (RM) distribution of the Mouse also suggests that
the low degree of polarization combined with a high RM ahead of the pulsar
result from internal plasma within the bowshock region. In addition, using
sub-arcsecond radio image of the Mouse, we identify modulations in the
brightness distribution of the Mouse that may be associated with the unshocked
pulsar wind behind the pulsar. Lastly, we discuss the relationship between the
Mouse and its neighboring shell-type supernova remnant G359.1--0.5 and argue
that these two sources could potentially have the same origin.",2005-03-02T04:44:35Z
Impact of non-uniform surface magnetic fields on stellar winds,"Observations of active stars reveal highly non-uniform surface distributions
of magnetic flux. Theoretical models considering magnetised stellar winds
however often presume uniform surface magnetic fields, characterised by a
single magnetic field strength. The present work investigates the impact of
non-uniform surface magnetic field distributions on the stellar mass and
angular momentum loss rates. The approach of Weber & Davis (1967) is extended
to non-equatorial latitudes to quantify the impact of latitude-dependent
magnetic field distributions over a large range of stellar rotation rates and
thermal wind properties. The analytically prescribed field patterns are
dominated by magnetic flux concentrations at intermediate and high latitudes.
The global stellar mass loss rates are found to be rather insensitive to
non-uniformities of the surface magnetic field. Depending on the non-uniformity
of the field distribution, the angular momentum loss rates deviate in contrast
at all rotation rates between -60% and 10% from the Weber & Davis-values, and
the effective Alfvenic radii up to about +/-25%. These large variations albeit
equal amounts of total magnetic flux indicate that a classification of stellar
surface magnetic fields through a single field strength is insufficient, and
that their non-uniformity has to be taken into account. The consequences for
applications involving magnetised stellar winds are discussed in view of the
rotational evolution of solar-like stars and of the observational determination
of their mass loss rates using the terminal velocity and ram pressure of the
wind. For rapidly rotating stars the latitudinal variation of the wind ram
pressure is found to exceed, depending on the actual field distribution on the
stellar surface, over two orders of magnitude.",2005-06-08T15:29:10Z
Evolution of reconnection along an arcade of magnetic loops,"RHESSI observations of a solar flare showing continuous motions of double
hard X-ray sources interpreted as footpoints of magnetic loops are presented.
The temporal evolution shows many distinct emission peaks of duration of some
tens of seconds ('elementary flare bursts'). Elementary flare bursts have been
interpreted as instabilities or oscillations of the reconnection process
leading to an unsteady release of magnetic energy. These interpretations based
on two-dimensional concepts cannot explain these observations, showing that the
flare elements are displaced in a third dimension along the arcade. Therefore,
the observed flare elements are not a modulation of the reconnection process,
but originate as this process progresses along an arcade of magnetic loops.
Contrary to previous reports, we find no correlation between footpoint motion
and hard X-ray flux. This flare apparently contradicts the predictions of the
standard translation invariant 2.5D reconnection models.",2005-04-20T10:30:20Z
Cool Versus Ultracool White Dwarfs,"A preliminary $BVRIJHK$ analysis of the white dwarfs SSSPM J2231$-$7514 and
SSSPM J2231$-$7515 is presented. Although both stars were reported to have
$T_{\rm eff}<4000$ K, the analysis here indicates $T_{\rm eff}\approx4250$ K
for both SSSPM J2231$-$7514 and SSSPM J2231$-$7515. Given substantial
scientific interest in the coolest extant degenerate stars, it is necessary to
distinguish sub 4000 K objects from the bulk of cool white dwarfs. This
analysis reiterates the importance of near infrared observations in
constraining the spectral energy distributions and effective temperatures of
the coolest white dwarfs and briefly discusses their possible origins.",2005-02-07T11:07:15Z
The dust obscuration bias in Damped Lyman alpha systems,"We present a new study of the effects of quasar obscuration on the statistics
of Damped Ly alpha (DLA) systems. We show that the extinction of any Galactic
or extragalactic HI region increases with the column density of zinc with a
turning point above which background sources are suddenly obscured. We derive a
relation between the extinction of a DLA system and its HI column density, N,
metallicity, Z, fraction of iron in dust, f_Fe(Z), and redshift, z. From this
relation we estimate the fraction of DLA systems missed as a consequence of
their own extinction in magnitude-limited surveys. We derive a method for
recovering the true frequency distributions of N and Z in DLAs, f_N and f_Z,
using the biased distributions measured in the redshift range where the
observations have sufficient statistics (1.8 </= z </= 3). By applying our
method we find that the well-known empirical thresholds of DLA column
densities, N(ZnII) </~ 10^13.1 cm^-2 and N(HI) </~ 10^22 cm^-2 can be
successfully explained in terms of the obscuration effect without tuning of the
local dust parameters. The obscuration has a modest effect on the distribution
of quasar apparent magnitudes, but plays an important role in shaping the
statistical distributions of DLAs. The exact estimate of the bias is still
limited by the paucity of the data (~40 zinc measurements at 1.8 </~ z </~ 3).
We find that the fraction of DLAs missed as a consequence of obscuration is
\~30% to 50%, consistent with the results of surveys of radio-selected quasars.
By modelling the metallicity distribution with a Schechter function we find
that the mean metallicity can be ~5 to 6 times higher than the value commonly
reported for DLAs at z~2.3.",2005-02-07T15:35:52Z
Imaging of Radio Supernovae,"As the shock and expanding shell of a supernova plow out through the
circumstellar material at thousands of km/s, radio emission is generated. VLBI
observations of this radio emission are presently the only means to directly
image the expanding shell of any supernova much farther away than SN 1987A. The
last decade has seen great progress in VLBI imaging of radio supernovae. In
particular, SN 1993J in the galaxy M81 provided a rare opportunity to closely
study an expanding supernova, and has been intensively observed. I summarize
some of the results on SN 1993J and other radio supernovae, and compare the
different observed radio supernovae. I briefly discuss the future prospects of
radio supernovae imaging.",2005-02-02T21:25:46Z
"Effects of Gravitational Evolution, Biasing, and Redshift Space
  Distortion on Topology","We have studied the dependence of topology of large scale structure on
tracer, gravitational evolution, redshift space distortion, and cosmology. A
series of large N-body simulations of the $\Lambda$CDM and SCDM models that
have evolved 1.1 or 8.6 billion particles, are used in the study. Evolution of
the genus statistic, used as a topology measure, from redshift 8 to 0 is
accurately calculated over a wide range of smoothing scales using the
simulations. The tracers of large scale structure considered are the CDM
matter, biased peaks in the initial density field, dark halos, and `galaxies'
populating the dark halos in accordance with a Halo Occupation Distribution
(HOD) model.
  We have found that the effects of biasing, gravitational evolution, and
initial conditions on topology of large scale structure are all comparable. The
redshift space distortion effects are relatively small down to about 5
$h^{-1}$Mpc for all tracers except for the high threshold part of the genus
curve. The gravitational effects are found to be well-modeled by the analytic
perturbation theory when the CDM matter distribution is considered. But the
direction of gravitational evolution of topology can be even reversed for
different tracers. For example, the shift parameter of the genus curve evolves
in opposite directions for matter and HOD `galaxies' at large scales. At small
scales there are interesting deviations of the genus curve of dark halos and
`galaxies' from that of matter in our initially Gaussian simulations. The
deviations should be understood as due to combined effects of gravitational
evolution and biasing.",2005-03-28T03:53:13Z
The Nature of Parallax Microlensing Events Towards the Galactic Bulge,"Perhaps as many as 30 parallax microlensing events are known, thanks to the
efforts of the MACHO, OGLE, EROS and MOA experiments monitoring the bulge.
Using Galactic models, we construct mock catalogues of microlensing light
curves towards the bulge, allowing for the uneven sampling and observational
error bars of the OGLE-II experiment. The fraction of parallax events with
delta chi^2 > 50 in the OGLE-II database is around ~1%, though higher fractions
are reported by some other surveys. This is in accord with expectations from
standard Galactic models. The fraction of parallax events depends strongly on
the Einstein crossing time (t_E), being less than 5% at t_E = 50 days but
rising to 50% at t_E > 1 yr. We find that the existence of parallax signatures
is essentially controlled by the acceleration of the observer normalised to the
projected Einstein radius on the observer plane divided by t_E^2. The
properties of the parallax events - time-scales, projected velocities, source
and lens locations - in our mock catalogues are analysed. Typically, ~38% of
parallax events are caused by a disk star microlensing a bulge source, while
\~33% are caused by a disk star microlensing a disk source (of these disk
sources, one sixth are at a distance of 5 kpc or less). There is a significant
shift in mean time-scale from 32 d for all events to ~130d for our parallax
events. There are corresponding shifts for other parameters, such as the
lens-source velocity projected onto the observer plane (~1110 km/s for all
events versus ~80 km/s for parallax events) and the lens distance (6.7 kpc
versus 3.7 kpc). We also assess the performance of parallax mass estimators and
investigate whether our mock catalogue can reproduce events with features
similar to a number of conjectured `black hole' lens candidates.",2005-04-25T12:02:35Z
Exploring X-ray emission and absorption in AGN with XMM-Newton EPIC,"Broad band X-ray spectra of high statistical quality obtained with the EPIC
instruments on XMM-Newton are being used to address key issues in AGN Physics,
including the evidence for strong gravity, massive and energetic outflows and
the effects of reflection and absorption in cold dense matter. A progress
report on these topics is presented by reference to high quality EPIC spectra
of 5 bright Seyfert galaxies covering a wide range in luminosity.",2005-05-20T16:16:55Z
Planar resonant periodic orbits in Kuiper belt dynamics,"In the framework of the planar restricted three body problem we study a
considerable number of resonances associated to the Kuiper Belt dynamics and
located between 30 and 48 a.u. Our study is based on the computation of
resonant periodic orbits and their stability. Stable periodic orbits are
surrounded by regular librations in phase space and in such domains the capture
of trans-Neptunian object is possible. All the periodic orbits found are
symmetric and there is evidence for the existence of asymmetric ones only in
few cases. In the present work first, second and third order resonances are
under consideration. In the planar circular case we found that most of the
periodic orbits are stable. The families of periodic orbits are temporarily
interrupted by collisions but they continue up to relatively large values of
the Jacobi constant and highly eccentric regular motion exists for all cases.
In the elliptic problem and for a particular eccentricity value of the primary
bodies the periodic orbits are isolated. The corresponding families, where they
belong to, bifurcate from specific periodic orbits of the circular problem and
seem to continue up to the rectilinear problem. Both stable and unstable orbits
are obtained for each case. In the elliptic problem the unstable orbits found
are associated with narrow chaotic domains in phase space. The evolution of the
orbits, which are located in such chaotic domains, seems to be practically
regular and bounded for long time intervals.",2005-02-28T16:04:19Z
"A tensor-vector-scalar framework for modified dynamics and cosmic dark
  matter","I describe a tensor-vector-scalar theory that reconciles the galaxy scale
success of modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) with the cosmological scale
evidence for CDM. The theory provides a cosmological basis for MOND in the
sense that the predicted phenomenology only arises in a cosmological
background. The theory contains an evolving effective potential, and scalar
field oscillations in this potential comprise the cold dark matter; the de
Broglie wavelength of these soft bosons, however, is sufficiently large that
they cannot accumulate in galaxies. The theory predicts, inevitably, a constant
anomalous acceleration in the outer solar system which, depending upon the
choice of parameters, can be consistent with that detected by the Pioneer
spacecrafts.",2005-02-10T16:55:05Z
"Testing the fireball/blastwave model by monitoring afterglows from soft
  gamma repeaters","The popular fireball/blastwave model of classical gamma-ray bursts is applied
to soft gamma-ray bursts. It is found that X-ray afterglows from strong events
may be above their quiescent levels for 40 -- 400 seconds. Optical afterglows
may also be detectable. By monitoring the three repeaters, we will have an
ideal way to check the fireball/blastwave model.",2005-02-22T12:17:26Z

Updated Colors for Cool Stars in the SDSS,"We present updated colors for M and L dwarfs based on photometry from the
third data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). These data are
improved in quality and number from earlier results. We also provide updated
equations for determining photometric parallaxes from SDSS colors of late-type
stars. Walkowicz, Hawley & West (2004) have recently presented new techniques
for studying the magnetic activity of low-mass stars and their method relies on
an accurate determination of SDSS color. We derive new relationships between
SDSS colors and other common passbands and present updated formulas from
Walkowicz et al. (2004) for determining the level of magnetic activity in M and
L dwarfs.",2005-04-29T20:00:02Z
"A contemporaneous infrared flash from a long gamma-ray burst: an echo
  from the central engine","The explosion that results in a cosmic gamma-ray burst (GRB) is thought to
produce emission from two physical processes -- the activity of the central
engine gives rise to the high-energy emission of the burst through internal
shocking and the subsequent interaction of the flow with the external
environment produces long-wavelength afterglow. While afterglow observations
continue to refine our understanding of GRB progenitors and relativistic
shocks, gamma-ray observations alone have not yielded a clear picture of the
origin of the prompt emission nor details of the central engine. Only one
concurrent visible-light transient has been found and was associated with
emission from an external shock. Here we report the discovery of infrared (IR)
emission contemporaneous with a GRB, beginning 7.2 minutes after the onset of
GRB 041219a. Our robotic telescope acquired 21 images during the active phase
of the burst, yielding the earliest multi-colour observations of any
long-wavelength emission associated with a GRB. Analysis of an initial IR pulse
suggests an origin consistent with internal shocks. This opens a new
possibility to study the central engine of GRBs with ground-based observations
at long wavelengths.",2005-03-23T21:00:02Z
"Rigorous luminosity function determination in presence of a background:
  theory and application to two intermediate redshift clusters","In this paper we present a rigorous derivation of the luminosity function
(LF) in presence of a background. Our approach is free from the logical
contradictions of assigning negative values to positively defined quantities
and avoid the use of incorrect estimates for the 68 % confidence interval
(error bar). It accounts for Poisson fluctuations ignored in previous
approaches and does not requires binning of the data. The method is extensible
to more complex situations, does not require the existence of an
environment--independent LF, and clarifies issues common to field LF
derivations. We apply the method to two clusters of galaxies at intermediate
redshift (z~0.3) with among the deepest and widest K_s observations ever taken.
Finally, we point out short-comings of flip--flopping magnitudes.",2005-03-31T15:47:17Z
"VLA Imaging of the Intriguing HI Cloud HIJASS J1021+6842 in the M81
  Group","We present VLA HI 21cm observations of HIJASS J1021+6842 which has been
discovered in the direction of the M81 group. Our synthesis imaging reveals
that the HI is distributed over a larger angular extent and velocity range than
the single dish discovery observations. Assuming that HIJASS J1021+6842 is at
the distance of the M81 group, we detect 1.5 x 10^8 M_sun of HI distributed
over as much as 30 kpc, i.e., substantially larger than the biggest dwarf
galaxies in the same group. At the depth of our imaging, the HI appears to be
confined to at least 7 clouds. Peak HI column densities are ~1.8 x 10^20 atoms
cm^-2 which is well below the canonical star formation threshold of ~10^21
atoms cm^-2 and therefore consistent with the fact that no optical counterpart
has as yet been identified. A gradient in velocity is observed across the
extent of the detected HI; assuming that the object is gravitationally bound we
derive a dynamical mass of 7 x 10^9 M_sun and a dark-to-luminous mass ratio of
>10. Alternatively, a tidal origin may also result in the observed velocity
gradient which would lead to a considerably lower dynamical mass. Given the
above properties and the absence of evidence of a stellar population, HIJASS
J1021+6842 is unique amongst the other systems in the M81 group.",2005-06-02T08:09:53Z
"uvby-Hbeta CCD photometry and membership segregation of the open cluster
  NGC 2548; Gaps in the Main Sequence of open clusters","Deep CCD photometry in the uvby-Hbeta intermediate-band system is presented
for the cluster NGC 2548 (M 48). A complete membership analysis based on
astrometric and photometric criteria is applied. The photometric analysis of a
selected sample of stars yields a reddening value of E(b-y)=0.06\pm0.03, a
distance modulus of V_0-M_V=9.3\pm0.5 (725 pc) and a metallicity of [Fe/H]=
-0.24\pm0.27. Through isochrone fitting we find an age of log t = 8.6\pm0.1
(400 Myr). Our optical photometry and JHK from 2MASS are combined to derive
effective temperatures of cluster member stars. The effective temperature
distribution along the main sequence of the cluster shows several gaps. A test
to study the significance of these gaps in the main sequence of the HR diagram
has been applied. The method is also applied to several other open clusters
(Pleiades, Hyades, NGC 1817 and M 67) to construct a sequence of metallicities
and ages. The comparison of the results of each cluster gives four gaps with
high significance (one of them, centred at 4900 K, has not been previously
reported).",2005-04-02T17:27:16Z
The stellar populations of the bluest low surface brightness galaxies,"Using optical/near-IR broadband photometry together with Halpha emission line
data, we attempt to constrain the star formation histories, ages, total stellar
masses and stellar mass-to-light ratios for a sample of extremely blue low
surface brightness galaxies. We find that, under standard assumptions about the
stellar initial mass function, the Halpha equivalent widths of these objects
appear inconsistent with recently suggested scenarios including constant or
increasing star formation rates over cosmological time scales. In a critical
assessment of the prospects of obtaining ages from integrated broadband
photometry, we conclude that even with near-IR data, the ages are poorly
constrained and that current observations cannot rule out the possibility that
these objects formed as recently as 1-2 Gyr ago. Methods which could
potentially improve the age estimates are discussed. The stellar masses of
these galaxies are inferred to lie below 10^10 solar masses. This, in
combination with low ages, could constitute a problem for current hierarchical
models of galaxy formation, which predict objects of this mass to form
predominantly early in the history of the universe. The possibility to use the
ages of the bluest low surface brightness galaxies as a test of such models is
demonstrated.",2005-02-16T09:30:59Z
On the stellar luminosity of the universe,"It has been noted at times that the rate of energy release in the most
violent explosive events in the Universe, such as supernovae and gamma-ray
bursts, rivals the stellar luminosity of the observable universe, Lstar. The
underlying reason turns out to be that both can be scaled to c^5/G = Lgrav,
albeit that for the explosions Lstar/Lgrav follows from first principles,
whereas for Lstar the scaling involves quantities too complex to derive from
elementary considerations at the present time. Under fairly general
circumstances, Lstar is dominated by stars whose age is similar to the Hubble
time.",2005-06-09T20:04:43Z
"Radiative equilibrium in Monte Carlo radiative transfer using frequency
  distribution adjustment","The Monte Carlo method is a powerful tool for performing radiative
equilibrium calculations, even in complex geometries. The main drawback of the
standard Monte Carlo radiative equilibrium methods is that they require
iteration, which makes them numerically very demanding. Bjorkman & Wood
recently proposed a frequency distribution adjustment scheme, which allows
radiative equilibrium Monte Carlo calculations to be performed without
iteration, by choosing the frequency of each re-emitted photon such that it
corrects for the incorrect spectrum of the previously re-emitted photons.
Although the method appears to yield correct results, we argue that its
theoretical basis is not completely transparent, and that it is not completely
clear whether this technique is an exact rigorous method, or whether it is just
a good and convenient approximation. We critically study the general problem of
how an already sampled distribution can be adjusted to a new distribution by
adding data points sampled from an adjustment distribution. We show that this
adjustment is not always possible, and that it depends on the shape of the
original and desired distributions, as well as on the relative number of data
points that can be added. Applying this theorem to radiative equilibrium Monte
Carlo calculations, we provide a firm theoretical basis for the frequency
distribution adjustment method of Bjorkman & Wood, and we demonstrate that this
method provides the correct frequency distribution through the additional
requirement of radiative equilibrium. We discuss the advantages and limitations
of this approach, and show that it can easily be combined with the presence of
additional heating sources and the concept of photon weighting. However, the
method may fail if small dust grains are included... (abridged)",2005-04-01T20:19:01Z
Pure and loaded fireballs in SGR giant flares,"On December 27, 2004, a giant flare from SGR 1806$-$20 was detected on earth.
Its thermal spectrum and temperature suggest that the flare resulted from an
energy release of about $10^{47}$ erg/sec close to the surface of a neutron
star in the form of radiation and/or pairs. This plasma expanded under its own
pressure producing a fireball and the observed gamma-rays escaped once the
fireball became optically thin. The giant flare was followed by a bright radio
afterglow, with an observable extended size, implying an energetic relativistic
outflow. We revisit here the evolution of relativistic fireballs and we
calculate the Lorentz factor and energy remaining in relativistic outflow once
the radiation escapes. We show that pairs that arise naturally in a pure
pairs-radiation fireball do not carry enough energy to account for the observed
afterglow. We consider various alternatives and we show that if the
relativistic outflow that causes the afterglow is related directly to the
prompt flare, then the initial fireball must be loaded by baryons or Poynting
flux. While we focus on parameters applicable to the giant flare and the radio
afterglow of SGR 1806$-$20 the calculations presented here might be also
applicable to GRBs.",2005-02-03T20:44:59Z
"A search for hot massive extrasolar planets around nearby young stars
  with the adaptive optics system NACO","We report on a survey devoted for the search of exo-planets around young and
nearby stars carried out with NACO at the VLT. The detection limit for 28 among
the best available targets vs. the angular separation from the star is
presented. The non-detection of any planetary mass companion in our survey is
used to derive, for the first time, the frequency of the upper limit of the
projected separation planet-stars. In particular, we find that in 50 % of
cases, no 5 MJ planet (or more massive) has been detected at projected
separations larger than 14 AU and no 10 MJ planet (or more massive) has been
detected at projected separations larger than 8.5 AU. In 100 % of cases, these
values increase to 36 AU and 65 AU respectively. The excellent sensitivity
reached by our study leads to a much lower upper limit of the projected
planet-star separation compared with previous studies. For example, for the
Beta Pictoris group, (~ 12 Myr), we did not detect any 10 MJ planet at
distances larger than 15 AU. A previous study carried out with 4 m class
telescopes put an upper limit for 10 MJ planets at ~ 60 AU. For our closest
target (V 2306 Oph - d = 4.3 pc) it is shown that it would be possible to
detect a 10 MJ planet at a minimum projected separation from the star of 1 AU
and a 5 MJ planet at a minimum projected separation of 3.7 AU. Our results are
discussed with respect to mechanisms explaining planet formation and migration
and to forthcoming observational strategies and future planet finder
observations from the ground.",2005-02-18T15:37:16Z
X-ray chemistry in envelopes around young stellar objects,"We present chemical models of the envelope of a young stellar object (YSO)
exposed to a central X-ray source. The models are applied to the massive
star-forming region AFGL 2591 for different X-ray fluxes. The total X-ray
ionization rate is dominated by the `secondary' ionization rate of H2 resulting
from fast electrons. The carbon, sulphur and nitrogen chemistries are
discussed. It is found that He+ and H3+ are enhanced and trigger a peculiar
chemistry. Several molecular X-ray tracers are found and compared to tracers of
the far ultraviolet (FUV) field. Like ultraviolet radiation fields, X-rays
enhance simple hydrides, ions and radicals. In contrast to ultraviolet photons,
X-rays can penetrate deep into the envelope and affect the chemistry even at
large distances from the source. Whereas the FUV enhanced species cover a
region of 200-300 AU, the region enhanced by X-rays is >1000 AU. Best-fit
models for AFGL 2591 predict an X-ray luminosity LX > 1e+31 ergs/s with a hard
X-ray spectrum TX > 3e+07 K. Furthermore, we find LX/Lbol ~ 1e-6. The chemistry
of the bulk of the envelope mass is dominated by cosmic-ray induced reactions
rather than by X-ray induced ionization for X-ray luminosities LX < 1e+33
ergs/s. The calculated line intensities of HCO+ and HCS+ show that high-J lines
are more affected than lower J lines by the presence of X-rays due to their
higher critical densities, and that such differences are detectable even with
large aperture single-dish telescopes. Future instruments such as Herschel-HIFI
or SOFIA will be able to observe X-ray enhanced hydrides whereas the
sensitivity and spatial resolution of ALMA is well-suited to measure the size
and geometry of the region affected by X-rays.",2005-06-14T13:44:56Z
MgII Absorption through Intermediate Redshift Galaxies,"The current status and remaining questions of MgII absorbers are reviewed
with an eye toward new results incorporating high quality Hubble Space
Telescope images of the absorbing galaxies. In the end, we find that our
current picture of extended gaseous regions around galaxies at earlier epochs
is in need of some revision; MgII absorbing ""halos"" appear to be patchier and
their geometry less regular than previously inferred. We also find that the
so-called ""weak"" MgII absorbers are associated with normal galaxies over a wide
range of impact parameters, suggesting that this class of absorber does not
strictly select low surface brightness, dwarf galaxies, or IGM material. We
emphasize the need for a complete survey of the galaxies in quasar fields, and
the importance of obtaining rotation curves of confirmed absorbing galaxies.",2005-04-18T15:35:21Z
"The broad-band X-ray spectrum of the blazar PKS B1830-211 by Chandra and
  INTEGRAL","In this paper we present a broad-band study of the X-ray emission of the
blazar PKS1830-211 based on Chandra and Integral observations. Notwithstanding
the high redshift (z=2.507), it is a bright X-ray source (F(2-10 keV)~10^{-11}
erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}), due to gravitational lensing by an intervening galaxy at
z=0.89. Previous X-ray observations attribute the observed absorption at E<2
keV to the lensing galaxy. Our analysis, although not in contrast with this
hypothesis, suggests also the possibility of an intrinsic (ionized) absorption,
taking place at the front side of the jet. This scenario is also supported by
some evidence, in the same data, of a feature observed at 2.15 keV which can be
interpreted as a blueshifted iron line (v/c ~ 0.18). The SED of PKS1830-211 can
be well modelled by combining a Synchrotron Self-Compton component and an
external source of photons to be scattered up to \gamma-ray energies by
relativistic electrons moving outward in the jet. The main source of low energy
photons is a dust torus at the temperature of 10^3 K as expected in MeV
blazars.",2005-04-06T10:10:28Z
"Feedback and metal enrichment in cosmological SPH simulations I. A model
  for chemical enrichment","We discuss a model for treating chemical enrichment by SNII and SNIa
explosions in simulations of cosmological structure formation. Our model
includes metal-dependent radiative cooling and star formation in dense
collapsed gas clumps. Metals are returned into the diffuse interstellar medium
by star particles using a local SPH smoothing kernel. A variety of chemical
abundance patterns in enriched gas arise in our treatment owing to the
different yields and lifetimes of SNII and SNIa progenitor stars. In the case
of SNII chemical production, we adopt metal-dependent yields. Because of the
sensitive dependence of cooling rates on metallicity, enrichment of galactic
haloes with metals can in principle significantly alter subsequent gas infall
and the build up of the stellar components. Indeed, in simulations of isolated
galaxies we find that a consistent treatment of metal-dependent cooling
produces 25% more stars outside the central region than simulations with a
primordial cooling function. In the highly-enriched central regions, the
evolution of baryons is however not affected by metal cooling, because here the
gas is always dense enough to cool. A similar situation is found in
cosmological simulations because we include no strong feedback processes which
could spread metals over large distances and mix them into unenriched diffuse
gas. We demonstrate this explicitly with test simulations which adopt
super-solar cooling functions leading to large changes both in the stellar mass
and in the metal distributions. We also find that the impact of metallicity on
the star formation histories of galaxies may depend on their particular

processes for interpreting the cosmic metal enrichment.",2005-05-20T14:47:47Z
Galaxy Rotation Curves Without Non-Baryonic Dark Matter,"We apply the modified acceleration law obtained from Einstein gravity coupled
explaining galaxy rotation curves without exotic dark matter. Our sample of
galaxies includes low surface brightness (LSB) and high surface brightness
(HSB) galaxies, and an elliptical galaxy. In those cases where photometric data
are available, a best fit via the single parameter (M/L)_{stars} to the
luminosity of the gaseous (HI plus He) and luminous stellar disks is obtained.
Additionally, a best fit to the rotation curves of galaxies is obtained in
terms of a parametric mass distribution (independent of luminosity
observations) -- a two parameter fit to the total galactic mass, (or
mass-to-light ratio M/L), and a core radius associated with a model of the
galaxy cores using a nonlinear least-squares fitting routine including
estimated errors. The fits are compared to those obtained using Milgrom's
phenomenological MOND model and to the predictions of the Newtonian-Kepler
acceleration law.",2005-06-16T13:32:01Z
"Cosmic Microwave Background, Accelerating Universe and Inhomogeneous
  Cosmology","We consider a cosmology in which a spherically symmetric large scale
inhomogeneous enhancement or a void are described by an inhomogeneous metric
and Einstein's gravitational equations. For a flat matter dominated universe
the inhomogeneous equations lead to luminosity distance and Hubble constant
formulas that depend on the location of the observer. For a general
inhomogeneous solution, it is possible for the deceleration parameter to differ
significantly from the FLRW result. The deceleration parameter $q_0$ can be
interpreted as $q_0 > 0$ ($q_0=1/2$ for a flat matter dominated universe) in a
FLRW universe and be $q_0 < 0$ as inferred from the inhomogeneous enhancement
that is embedded in a FLRW universe. A spatial volume averaging of local
regions in the backward light cone has to be performed for the inhomogeneous
solution at late times to decide whether the decelerating parameter $q$ can be
negative for a positive energy condition. The CMB temperature fluctuations
across the sky can be unevenly distributed in the northern and southern
hemispheres in the inhomogeneous matter dominated solution, in agreement with
the analysis of the WMAP power spectrum data by several authors. The model can
possibly explain the anomalous alignment of the quadrupole and octopole moments
observed in the WMAP data.",2005-02-04T20:45:51Z
"Discovery of 10 micron silicate emission in quasars. Evidence of the AGN
  unification scheme","According to the unified scheme, AGN are surrounded by a dust-torus, and the
observed diversity of AGN properties results from the different orientations
relative to our line of sight. The strong resonance of silicate dust at 10
micron is therefore, as expected, seen in absorption towards many type-2 AGN.
In type-1 AGN, it should be seen in emission because the hot inner surface of
the dust torus becomes visible. However, this has not been observed so far,
thus challenging the unification scheme or leading to exotic modifications of
the dust-torus model. Here we report the discovery of the 10 micron silicate
feature in emission in two luminous quasars with the Infrared Spectrograph of
the Spitzer Space Telescope.",2005-04-12T08:12:47Z
Lyot Coronagraphy on Giant Segmented-Mirror Telescopes,"We present a study of Lyot style (i.e., classical, band-limited, and Gaussian
occulter) coronagraphy on extremely large, highly-segmented telescopes. We show
that while increased telescope diameter is always an advantage for high dynamic
range science (assuming wavefront errors have been corrected sufficiently
well), segmentation itself sets a limit on the performance of Lyot
coronagraphs. Diffraction from inter-segment gaps sets a floor to the
achievable extinction of on-axis starlight with Lyot coronagraphy. We derive an
analytical expression for the manner in which coronagraphic suppression of an
on-axis source decreases with increasing gap size when the segments are placed
in a spatially periodic array over the telescope aperture, regardless of the
details of the arrangement. A simple Lyot stop masking out pupil edges produces
good extinction of the central peak in the point-spread function (PSF), but
leaves satellite images caused by inter-segment gaps essentially unaffected.
Masking out the bright segment gaps in the Lyot plane with a reticulated mask
reduces the satellite images'intensity to a contrast of 5x10^{-9} on a 30 m
telescope with 10 mm gaps, at the expense of an increase in the brightness of
the central peak. The morphology of interesting targets will dictate which Lyot
stop geometry is preferable: the reticulated Lyot stop produces a conveniently
uni-modal PSF, whereas a simple Lyot stop produces an extended array of
satellite spots. A cryogenic reticulate Lyot stop will also benefit both direct
and coronagraphic mid-IR imaging.",2005-05-02T20:09:15Z
"The Physical Natures of Class I and Flat-Spectrum Protostellar
  Photospheres: A Near-Infrared Spectroscopic Study","We present high resolution (R = 18,000), high signal-to-noise, 2 micron
spectra of 52 infrared-selected Class I and flat-spectrum young stellar objects
in the Taurus-Auriga, $\rho$ Ophiuchi, Serpens, Perseus, and Corona Australis
dark clouds. We detect key absorption lines in 41 objects and fit synthetic
spectra generated from pre-main sequence models to deduce the effective
temperatures, surface gravities, near-infrared veilings, rotation velocities,
and radial velocities of each of these 41 sources. We find these objects to
span ranges in effective temperature, surface gravity, and stellar luminosity
which appear similar to those of late spectral-type Class II sources and
classical T-Tauri stars. We determine that the mean 2 micron veiling of Class I
and flat-spectrum objects is significantly higher than that of Class II objects
in the same region where both types of objects are extensively observed ($\rho$
Oph). We find a significant fraction of our protostellar sample also exhibits
emission lines. Twenty-three objects show H$_2$ emission, usually indicative of
the presence of energetic outflows. Thirty-four sources show HI Br $\gamma$
emission and a number of these exhibit profile asymmetries consistent with
in-fall. Eight sources show significant $\Delta v = 2$ CO emission suggestive
of emission from a circumstellar disk. Overall, these observations indicate
that Class I and flat-spectrum objects are self-embedded protostars undergoing
significant mass accretion, although the objects appear to span a broad range
of mass accretion activity.",2005-05-13T18:53:55Z
"POINT-AGAPE Pixel Lensing Survey of M31 : Evidence for a MACHO
  contribution to Galactic Halos","The POINT-AGAPE collaboration is carrying out a search for gravitational
microlensing toward M31 to reveal galactic dark matter in the form of MACHOs
(Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects) in the halos of the Milky Way and
M31. A high-threshold analysis of 3 years of data yields 6 bright,
short--duration microlensing events, which are confronted to a simulation of
the observations and the analysis. The observed signal is much larger than
expected from self lensing alone and we conclude, at the 95% confidence level,
that at least 20% of the halo mass in the direction of M31 must be in the form
of MACHOs if their average mass lies in the range 0.5-1 M$_\odot$. This lower
bound drops to 8% for MACHOs with masses $\sim 0.01$ M$_\odot$. In addition, we
discuss a likely binary microlensing candidate with caustic crossing. Its
location, some 32' away from the centre of M31, supports our conclusion that we
are detecting a MACHO signal in the direction of M31.",2005-04-07T19:52:28Z
CO emission from discs around isolated HAeBe and Vega-excess stars,"We describe results from a survey for J=3-2 12CO emission from visible stars
with an infrared excess. The line is clearly detected in 21 objects, with
molecular gas (>10^-3 Jupiter masses) common in targets with infrared excesses
>0.01 (>56% of objects). Such high excesses indicate the presence of a disc of
opening angle >12 degrees; within this, the optically thick disc prevents CO
photodissociation. Two or three stars with associated CO have an excess <0.01,
implying a disc opening angle <1 degree. Most line profiles are double-peaked
or relatively broad. Model fits, assuming a Keplerian disc, indicate outer
radii, R_out, of ~20-300 au. As many as 5 discs have outer radii smaller than
the Solar System (50 au), and a further 4 have gas at radii <20 au. R_out is
independent of the stellar spectral type (from K through to B9), but is
correlated with total dust mass. R_out appears to decrease with time: discs
around stars of age 3-7 Myr have a mean radius of ~210 au, whereas discs of age
7-20 Myr are a factor of 3 smaller. The only bona fide debris disc with
detected CO is HD9672; this has a double peaked line profile and is the most
compact gas disc observed, with a modelled radius 17 au). A fit to HD141569
suggests the gas lies in two rings of radii 90 and 250 au, similar to the
scattered light structure. In both AB Aur and HD163296 the sizes of the
molecular and dust scattering discs are also similar, suggesting that the gas
and small dust grains are co-located.",2005-02-25T16:59:42Z
"The effect of MHD turbulence on massive protoplanetary disk
  fragmentation","Massive disk fragmentation has been suggested to be one of the mechanisms
leading to the formation of giant planets. While it has been heavily studied in
quiescent hydrodynamic disks, the effect of MHD turbulence arising from the
magnetorotational instability (MRI) has never been investigated. This paper
fills this gap and presents 3D numerical simulations of the evolution of
locally isothermal, massive and magnetized disks. In the absence of magnetic
fields, a laminar disk fragments and clumps are formed due to the effect of
self--gravity. Although they disapear in less than a dynamical timescale in the
simulations because of the limited numerical resolution, various diagnostics
suggest that they should survive and form giant planets in real disks. When the
disk is magnetized, it becomes turbulent at the same time as gravitational
instabilities develop. At intermediate resolution, no fragmentation is observed
in these turbulent models, while a large number of fragments appear in the
equivalent hydrodynamical runs. This is because MHD turbulence reduces the
strength of the gravitational instability. As the resolution is increased, the
most unstable wavelengths of the MRI are better resolved and small scale
angular momentum transport starts to play a role: fragments are found to form
in massive and turbulent disks in that case. All of these results indicate that
there is a complicated interaction between gravitational instabilities and MHD
turbulence that influences disk fragmentation processes.",2005-06-09T20:00:34Z
Determination of stellar shape in microlensing event MOA 2002-BLG-33,"We report a measurement of the shape of the source star in microlensing event
MOA 2002-BLG-33. The lens for this event was a close binary whose
centre-of-mass passed almost directly in front of the source star. At this
time, the source star was closely bounded on all sides by a caustic of the
lens. This allowed the oblateness of the source star to be constrained. We
found that a/b = 1.02^{+0.04}_{-0.02} where a and b are its semi-major and
semi-minor axes respectively. The angular resolution of this measurement is
approximately 0.04 microarcsec. We also report HST images of the event that
confirm a previous identification of the source star as an F8-G2 turn-off
main-sequence star.",2005-06-01T10:56:40Z
A Deep Infrared Search for AXP 1E 1841-045,"Multi-colour (JHKs) imaging and photometry of the field of the Anomalous
X-ray Pulsar AXP 1E 1841-045 is analysed in the light of new, accurate
coordinates from Chandra (Wachter et al, 2004). From excellentquality images,
we find multiple sources in and around the position error circle. Of these,
none can be confidently identified as the infrared counterpart. The limiting
magnitudes reached were J=22.1, H=20.7 and Ks=19.9$ (95% confidence).",2005-06-13T19:39:52Z
$γ$-ray flux from Dark Matter Annihilation in Galactic Caustics,"In the frame of indirect dark matter searches we investigate the flux of
high-energy $\gamma$-ray photons produced by annihilation of dark matter in
caustics within our Galaxy under the hypothesis that the bulk of dark matter is
composed of the lightest supersymmetric particles. Unfortunately, the detection
of the caustics annihilation signal with currently available instruments is
rather challenging. Indeed, with realistic assumptions concerning particle
physics and cosmology, the $\gamma $-ray signal from caustics is below the
detection threshold of both $\check {\rm C}$erenkov telescopes and
satellite-borne experiments. Nevertheless, we find that this signal is more
prominent than that expected if annihilation only occurs in the smoothed
Galactic halo, with the possible exception of a $\sim 15^{\circ}$ circle around
the Galactic center if the mass density profile of our Galaxy exhibits a sharp
cusp there. We show that the angular distribution of this $\gamma$-ray flux
changes significantly if DM annihilation preferentially occurs within
virialized sub-halos populating our Galaxy rather than in caustics.",2005-05-03T13:56:07Z
Pulsar: repeatable Lagrangian singularity,"In general, the interior of radially symmetric self-gravitating sphere is
considered in terms of hydrostatic equilibrium (HSE). This approach implies the
possibility of the static being of a body. Such a static state is assumed to be
the result of asymptotic damping of the process of formation. It is shown here
that the damping of this process is impossible: if a sphere vibrates radially,
then compressional wave is singular at the centre; dynamical singularity has no
intermediate stages of the fading; the HSE-state is unachievable.
Self-gravitating sphere perpetually vibrates in essentially singular way, it
contains dynamical central region -- pulsatile Lagrangian cavity. Theoretical
properties of this cavity indicate that this is a pulsar. A pulsar is common
structural feature for every self-gravitating structure.",2005-03-10T00:48:10Z
"Upper Limits on the Extragalactic Background Light from the Gamma-Ray
  Spectra of Blazars","The direct measurement of the extragalactic background light (EBL) is
difficult at optical to infrared wavelengths because of the strong foreground
radiation originating in the Solar System. Very high energy (VHE, E$>$100 GeV)
gamma rays interact with EBL photons of these wavelengths through pair
production. In this work, the available VHE spectra from six blazars are used
to place upper limits on the EBL. These blazars have been detected over a range
of redshifts and a steepening of the spectral index is observed with increasing
source distance. This can be interpreted as absorption by the EBL. In general,
knowledge of the intrinsic source spectrum is necessary to determine the
density of the intervening EBL. Motivated by the observed spectral steepening
with redshift, upper limits on the EBL are derived by assuming that the
intrinsic spectra of the six blazars are $\propto E^{-1.8}$. Upper limits are
then placed on the EBL flux at discrete energies without assuming a specific
spectral shape for the EBL. This is an advantage over other methods since the
EBL spectrum is uncertain.",2005-04-18T19:37:34Z
The mass-metallicity relation for high-redshift damped Ly-alpha galaxies,"We used our database of ESO VLT-UVES spectra of quasars to build up a sample
of 67 Damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) systems with redshifts 1.7<zabs<3.7. For each
system, we measured average metallicities relative to Solar, [X/H] (with either
X=Zn, S or Si), and the velocity widths of low-ionization line profiles, W1. We
find that there is a tight correlation between the two quantities, detected at
the 5sigma significance level. The existence of such a correlation, over more
than two orders of magnitude spread in metallicity, is likely to be the
consequence of an underlying mass-metallicity relation for the galaxies
responsible for DLA absorption lines. The best-fit linear relation is
[X/H]=1.35(\pm 0.11)\log W1 -3.69(\pm 0.18)$ with W1 expressed in km/s. While
the slope of this velocity-metallicity relation is the same within
uncertainties between the higher and the lower redshift bins of our sample,
there is a hint of an increase of the intercept point of the relation with
decreasing redshift. This suggests that galaxy halos of a given mass tend to
become more metal-rich with time. Moreover, the slope of this relation is
consistent with that of the luminosity-metallicity relation for local galaxies.
The DLA systems having the lowest metallicities among the DLA population would
therefore, on average, correspond to the galaxies having the lowest masses. In
turn, these galaxies should have the lowest luminosities among the DLA galaxy
population. This may explain the recent result that the few DLA systems with
detected Ly-alpha emission have higher than average metallicities.",2005-04-18T22:47:04Z
The counterparts of Local Group dwarf spheroidals in nearby clusters,"In this contribution, we report on the discovery of dwarf spheroidals (dSphs)
in the core of the Fornax cluster. Their photometric properties -- like
magnitude, colour, surface brightness -- are very similar to those of Local
Group dSphs. However, at a given total magnitude, dSphs in Fornax seem to be
more extended than their Local Group counterparts. The membership of several
dwarf galaxy candidates in Fornax has been confirmed by surface brightness
fluctuation measurements on deep wide-field images taken with the Magellan
telescope. The analysis of these images also confirms the flat faint end slope
of the luminosity function for dSphs in Fornax which contradicts the expected
large number of small dark matter halos connected to dwarf galaxies in
LambdaCDM theory. Dwarf spheroidals have also been detected in the Hydra I and
Centaurus cluster. A preliminary analysis of their photometric properties shows
that they obey similar scaling relations as their counterparts in Fornax and
the Local Group.",2005-05-10T12:07:02Z
"Oxygen isotopic ratios in galactic clouds along the line of sight
  towards Sagittarius B2","As an independent check on previous measurements of the isotopic abundance of
oxygen through the Galaxy, we present a detailed analysis of the ground state
rotational lines of 16OH and 18OH in absorption towards the giant molecular
cloud complex, Sagittarius B2. We have modelled the line shapes to separate the
contribution of several galactic clouds along the line of sight and calculate
16OH/18OH ratios for each of these features. The best fitting values are in the
range 320-540, consistent with the previous measurements in the Galactic Disk
but slightly higher than the standard ratio in the Galactic Centre. They do not
show clear evidence for a gradient in the isotopic ratio with galactocentric
distance. The individual 16OH column densities relative to water give ratios of
[H2O/OH]=0.6-1.2, similar in magnitude to galactic clouds in the sight lines
towards W51 and W49. A comparison with CH indicates [OH/CH] ratios higher than
has been previously observed in diffuse clouds. We estimate OH abundances of
10^-7 - 10^-6 in the line of sight features.",2005-04-07T10:27:20Z
"On the nature of Lithium-rich giant stars: constraints from Beryllium
  abundances","We have derived beryllium abundances for 7 Li-rich giant (A(Li) > 1.5) stars
and 10 other Li-normal giants, with the aim of investigating the origin of the
Lithium in the Li-rich giants. In particular, we test the predictions of the
engulfment scenario proposed by Siess & Livio (1999), where the engulfment of a
brown dwarf or one or more giant planets would lead to a simultaneous
enrichment of 7Li and 9Be. We show that regardless their nature, none of the
stars studied in this paper were found to have detectable beryllium. Using
simple dilution arguments we show that the engulfment of an external object as
the sole source of Li enrichment is ruled out by the Li and Be abundance data.
The present results favor the idea that Li has been produced in the interior of
the stars by a Cameron-Fowler process and brought up to the surface by an extra
mixing mechanism.",2005-04-06T00:31:48Z
Magnetic-field generation in helical turbulence,"We investigate analytically the amplification of a weak magnetic field in a
homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flow lacking reflectional symmetry (helical
turbulence). We propose that the spectral distributions of magnetic energy and
magnetic helicity can be found as eigenmodes of a self-adjoint,
Schr\""odinger-type system of evolution equations. We argue that large-scale and
small-scale magnetic fluctuations cannot be effectively separated, and that the
conventional alpha-model is, in general, not an adequate description of the
large-scale dynamo mechanism. As a consequence, the correct numerical modeling
of such processes should resolve magnetic fluctuations down to the very small,
resistive scales.",2005-04-27T02:37:44Z
"A wide-field photometric study of the globular cluster system of NGC
  4636","We investigate the unusually rich cluster system of NGC4636 with wide-field
Washington photometry. The globular cluster luminosity function can be followed
roughly 1 mag beyond the turn-over magnitude. This corresponds to a distance
modulus of m-M=31.24+-0.17, 0.4 mag larger than the distance determined from
surface brightness fluctuations. The high specific frequency is confirmed, yet
the exact value remains uncertain because of the uncertain distance: it varies
between 5.6+-1.2 and 8.9+-1.2. The globular cluster system has a clearly
bimodal color distribution. The color peak positions show no radial dependence
and are in good agreement with the values found for other galaxies studied in
the same filter system. However, a luminosity dependence is found: brighter
clusters with an ``intermediate'' color exist. The clusters exhibit a shallow
radial distribution within 7'.Within the same radial interval, the galaxy light
has a distinctly steeper profile. Because of the difference in the cluster and
light distribution the specific frequency increases considerably with radius.
At 7' and 9' the density profiles of the red and blue clusters, respectively,
change strongly which indicates that we reach the outer rim of the cluster
system at approximately 11'. This feature is seen for the first time in a
globular cluster system. While the radial distribution of the cluster and field
populations are rather different, this is not true for the ellipticity of the
system: the elongation as well as the position angle of the cluster system
agree well with the galaxy light. We compare the radial distribution of
globular clusters with the light profiles for a sample of elliptical galaxies.
The difference observed in NGC 4636 is typical of an elliptical galaxy of this
luminosity.",2005-03-13T11:55:40Z
"The Mass Assembly Histories of Galaxies of Various Morphologies in the
  GOODS Fields","We present an analysis of the growth of stellar mass with cosmic time
partitioned according to galaxy morphology. Using a well-defined catalog of
2150 galaxies based, in part, on archival data in the GOODS fields, we assign
morphological types in three broad classes (Ellipticals, Spirals,
Peculiar/Irregulars) to a limit of z_AB=22.5 and make the resulting catalog
publicly available. We combine redshift information, optical photometry from
the GOODS catalog and deep K-band imaging to assign stellar masses. We find
little evolution in the form of the galaxy stellar mass function from z~1 to
z=0, especially at the high mass end where our results are most robust.
Although the population of massive galaxies is relatively well established at
z~1, its morphological mix continues to change, with an increasing proportion
of early-type galaxies at later times. By constructing type-dependent stellar
mass functions, we show that in each of three redshift intervals, E/S0's
dominate the higher mass population, while spirals are favored at lower masses.
This transition occurs at a stellar mass of 2--3 times 10^{10} Msun at z~0.3
(similar to local studies) but there is evidence that the relevant mass scale
moves to higher mass at earlier epochs. Such evolution may represent the
morphological extension of the ``downsizing'' phenomenon, in which the most
massive galaxies stop forming stars first, with lower mass galaxies becoming
quiescent later. We infer that more massive galaxies evolve into spheroidal
systems at earlier times, and that this morphological transformation may only
be completed 1--2 Gyr after the galaxies emerge from their active star forming
phase. We discuss several lines of evidence suggesting that merging may play a
key role in generating this pattern of evolution.",2005-02-09T21:29:11Z
"A Gas-poor Planetesimal Capture Model for the Formation of Giant Planet
  Satellite Systems","Assuming that an unknown mechanism (e.g., gas turbulence) removes most of the
subnebula gas disk in a timescale shorter than that for satellite formation, we
develop a model for the formation of regular (and possibly at least some of the
irregular) satellites around giant planets in a gas-poor environment. In this
model, which follows along the lines of the work of Safronov et al. (1986),
heliocentric planetesimals collide within the planet's Hill sphere and generate
a circumplanetary disk of prograde and retrograde satellitesimals extending as
far out as $\sim R_H/2$. At first, the net angular momentum of this
proto-satellite swarm is small, and collisions among satellitesimals leads to
loss of mass from the outer disk, and delivers mass to the inner disk (where
regular satellites form) in a timescale $\lesssim 10^5$ years. This mass loss
may be offset by continued collisional capture of sufficiently small $< 1$ km
interlopers resulting from the disruption of planetesimals in the feeding zone
of the giant planet. As the planet's feeding zone is cleared in a timescale
$\lesssim 10^5$ years, enough angular momentum may be delivered to the
proto-satellite swarm to account for the angular momentum of the regular
satellites of Jupiter and Saturn.(abridged)",2005-04-28T20:20:34Z
"The Evolution of the Dark Halo Spin Parameters lambda and lambda' in a
  LCDM Universe: The Role of Minor and Major Mergers","The evolution of the spin parameter of dark halos and the dependence on the
halo merging history in a set of dissipationless cosmological LCDM simulations
is investigated. Special focus is placed on the differences of the two commonly
used versions of the spin parameter, namely lambda=J*E^1/2/(G*M^5/2) (Peebles
80) and lambda'=J/(sqrt(2)*M_vir*R_vir*V_vir) (Bullock et al. 01). Though the
distribution of the spin transfer rate defined as the ratio of the spin
parameters after and prior to a merger is similar to a high degree for both,
lambda and lambda', we find considerable differences in the time evolution:
while lambda' is roughly independent of redshift, lambda turns out to increase
significantly with decreasing redshift. This distinct behaviour arises from
small differences in the spin transfer during accretion events. The evolution
of the spin parameter is strongly coupled with the virial ratio
eta:=2*E_kin/|E_pot| of dark halos. Major mergers disturb halos and increase
both their virial ratio and spin parameter for 1-2 Gyrs. At high redshifts
(z=2-3) many halos are disturbed with an average virial ratio of eta = 1.3
which approaches unity until z=0. We find that the redshift evolution of the
spin parameters is dominated by the huge number of minor mergers rather than
the rare major merger events.",2005-05-12T10:44:41Z
"VLT Spectroscopy of Globular Cluster Systems, II. Spectroscopic Ages,
  Metallicities, and [alpha/Fe] Ratios of Globular Clusters in Early-Type
  Galaxies","An analysis of ages, metallicities, and [alpha/Fe] ratios of globular cluster
systems in early-type galaxies is presented, based on Lick index measurements
summarized in Puzia et al. (2004, Paper I of this series). In the light of
calibration and measurement uncertainties, age-metallicity degeneracy, and the
relative dynamic range of Lick indices, as well as systematics introduced by
abundance ratio variations (in particular variations of [alpha/Fe] ratios), we
find that the most reliable age indicator for our dataset is a combination of
the Lick Balmer-line indices HgammaA, Hbeta, and HdeltaA. [MgFe]' is used as a
spectroscopic metallicity indicator which is least affected by [alpha/Fe]
variations. We introduce an interpolation routine to simultaneously derive
ages, metallicities, and [alpha/Fe] ratios from diagnostic grids constructed
from Lick indices. From a comparison of high-quality data with SSP model
predictions, we find that ~2/3 of the globular clusters in early-type galaxies
are older than 10 Gyr, up to 1/3 have ages in the range ~5-10 Gyr, and only a
few cluster are younger than ~5 Gyr. Our sample of globular clusters covers
metallicities from [Z/H] = -1.3 up to ~0.5 dex. We find that metal-rich
globular clusters show on average a smaller mean age and a larger age scatter
than their metal-poor counterparts. [alpha/Fe] diagnostic plots show that
globular cluster systems in early-type galaxies have super-solar alpha/Fe
abundance ratios with a mean [alpha/Fe] = 0.47+/-0.06 dex and a dispersion of
about 0.3 dex. We find evidence for a correlation between [alpha/Fe] and
metallicity, in the sense that more metal-rich clusters exhibit lower
alpha-element enhancements. [abridged]",2005-05-20T20:52:22Z
"Smoothing Supernova Data to Reconstruct the Expansion History of the
  Universe and its Age","We propose a non-parametric method of smoothing supernova data over redshift
using a Gaussian kernel in order to reconstruct important cosmological
quantities including H(z) and w(z) in a model independent manner. This method
is shown to be successful in discriminating between different models of dark
energy when the quality of data is commensurate with that expected from the
future SuperNova Acceleration Probe (SNAP). We find that the Hubble parameter
is especially well-determined and useful for this purpose. The look back time
of the universe may also be determined to a very high degree of accuracy (\lleq
0.2 %) in this method. By refining the method, it is also possible to obtain
reasonable bounds on the equation of state of dark energy. We explore a new
diagnostic of dark energy-- the `w-probe'-- which can be calculated from the
first derivative of the data. We find that this diagnostic is reconstructed
extremely accurately for different reconstruction methods even if \Omega_m is
marginalized over. The w-probe can be used to successfully distinguish between
$\Lambda$CDM and other models of dark energy to a high degree of accuracy.",2005-05-16T20:01:52Z
Infall and SiO emission in V838 Mon,"We present moderate and high resolution infrared spectroscopy of the peculiar
eruptive variable V838 Mon, which underwent a series of remarkable outbursts in
early 2002. During the period covered by our observations, 2002 December-2003
December, the near-infrared spectrum continued to show many of the
characteristics of a very cool supergiant. However, throughout this period the
spectrum also revealed strong and variable SiO first overtone emission, and
Paschen Beta emission. The 2003 December spectrum contained a series of Ti I
lines with inverse P Cygni profiles. This is clear evidence that some material
is falling inward towards the star.",2005-02-21T13:32:44Z
"The X-ray binary population in M33: I. Source list and luminosity
  function","In this paper we present the source list for 3 Chandra observations of the
Local Group galaxy M33. The observations are centered on the nucleus and on the
star forming region NGC 604. We detect a total of 261 sources in an area of
\~0.2 square degree down to a flux limit of 3*10^{-16} erg/s/cm^2 which
corresponds to a luminosity of ~2*10^34 erg/s at a distance of 840 kpc. From
the source list we construct the luminosity functions of sources observed in
M33. Taking into account background contamination the luminosity functions are
consistent with those of other star forming galaxies. In addition, the
combination of X-ray color analysis and the existence of ``blue'' optical
counterparts strongly indicate that the X-ray point source population in M33
consists of young objects. Above 3*10^35 erg/s there are few X-ray sources in
the locus of the X-ray hardness ratio diagram that is generally populated by
LMXBs.",2005-06-15T18:17:20Z
Measuring the Primordial Deuterium Abundance During the Cosmic Dark Ages,"We discuss how measurements of fluctuations in the absorption of cosmic
microwave background (CMB) photons by neutral gas during the cosmic dark ages,
at redshifts z ~ 7--200, could reveal the primordial deuterium abundance of the
Universe. The strength of the cross-correlation of brightness-temperature
fluctuations due to resonant absorption of CMB photons in the 21-cm line of
neutral hydrogen with those due to resonant absorption of CMB photons in the
92-cm line of neutral deuterium is proportional to the fossil deuterium to
hydrogen ratio [D/H] fixed during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). Although
technically challenging, this measurement could provide the cleanest possible
determination of [D/H], free from contamination by structure formation
processes at lower redshifts, and has the potential to improve BBN constraints
to the baryon density of the Universe \Omega_{b} h^2. We also present our
results for the thermal spin-change cross-section for deuterium-hydrogen
scattering, which may be useful in a more general context than we describe
here.",2005-05-09T20:00:10Z
The uBVI Photometric System. II. Standard Stars,"Paper I of this series described the design of a CCD-based photometric system
that is optimized for ground-based measurements of the size of the Balmer
discontinuity in stellar spectra. This ""uBVI"" system combines the Thuan-Gunn u
filter with the standard Johnson-Kron-Cousins BVI filters, and it can be used
to discover luminous yellow supergiants in extragalactic systems and
post-asymptotic-giant-branch stars in globular clusters and galactic halos. In
the present paper we use uBVI observations obtained on 54 nights with 0.9-m
telescopes at Kitt Peak and Cerro Tololo to construct a catalog of standardized
u magnitudes for standard stars taken from the 1992 catalog of Landolt. We
describe the selection of our 14 Landolt fields, and give details of the
photometric reductions, including red-leak and extinction corrections,
transformation of all of the observations onto a common magnitude system, and
establishment of the photometric zero point. We present a catalog of u
magnitudes of 103 stars suitable for use as standards. We show that data
obtained with other telescopes can be transformed to our standard system with
better than 1% accuracy.",2005-03-03T20:41:38Z
"An Analytic Model for the Axis-Ratio Distribution of Dark Matter Halos
  from the Primordial Gaussian Density Field","We present an analytic expression for the axis ratio distribution of triaxial
dark matter halos driven from physical principles. Adopting the picture of
triaxial collapse based on the Zel'dovich approximation, we derive analytically
both the minor-to-major and the conditional intermediate-to-major axis ratio
distributions, and examine how they depend on the halo mass, redshift, and
cosmology. Our analytic model is tested against the simulation data given by
Jing & Suto in 2002, and found to reproduce the conditional
intermediate-to-major axis ratio distribution successfully and the
minor-to-major axis ratio distribution approximately. However, the trends of
our analytic axis-ratio distributions with mass and redshift are opposite to
what is found in N-body simulations. This failure of our analytic model puts a
limitation on analytic approaches based on the Lagrangian theory to the halo
ellipticity. Given the overall agreement with the simulation results, our model
provides a new theoretical step toward using the axis-ratio distribution of
dark halos as a cosmological probe. We also discuss several possibilities to
improve the model.",2005-04-28T07:50:50Z
"On the role of injection in kinetic approaches to nonlinear particle
  acceleration at non-relativistic shock waves","The dynamical reaction of the particles accelerated at a shock front by the
first order Fermi process can be determined within kinetic models that account
for both the hydrodynamics of the shocked fluid and the transport of the
accelerated particles. These models predict the appearance of multiple
solutions, all physically allowed. We discuss here the role of injection in
selecting the real solution, in the framework of a simple phenomenological
recipe, which is a variation of what is sometimes referred to as thermal
leakage. In this context we show that multiple solutions basically disappear
and when they are present they are limited to rather peculiar values of the
parameters. We also provide a quantitative calculation of the efficiency of
particle acceleration at cosmic ray modified shocks and we identify the
fraction of energy which is advected downstream and that of particles escaping
the system from upstream infinity at the maximum momentum. The consequences of
efficient particle acceleration for shock heating are also discussed.",2005-05-17T17:21:33Z
"The Geometry of and Mass Accretion Rate through the Maser Accretion Disk
  in NGC 4258","A maximum likelihood analysis of the NGC 4258 maser positions and velocities
reveals a ~2 sigma deviation from Keplerian motion in the projected rotation
curve of the high-velocity features, corresponding to a ~9 km/s, or 0.8%,
flattening of the LOS velocities with respect to Keplerian motion over the
range of the high-velocity masers. While there are a number of potential
explanations for this flattening, we argue for pure Keplerian rotation in an
inclination-warped disk based on the ability of this model to explain a number
of otherwise puzzling features of the system. A radial gradient in the disk
inclination of 0.034 mas^{-1} is not only consistent with the observed rotation
curve, but it generates a bowl along the near edge of the disk that naturally
explains the otherwise puzzling narrow spread in the declinations of the
systemic masers. It also explains the existence and location of an apparently
recurring flare amongst the systemic masers. There is no significant evidence
for non-Keplerian rotation in the inclination-warped disk. An additional
implication of the inclination warp is that the disk rises in front of and
obscures the central engine at a disk radius of about 8.3 mas, or 0.29 pc. By
comparing the observed X-ray column to conditions in the disk at this radius,
we argue that the molecular-to-atomic transition occurs just beyond the
outermost maser at 0.28 pc and from this we infer an accretion rate of
\~10^{-4}alpha M_sun/yr, consistent with the jet-dominated accretion models of
Yuan et al. (2002). Our model suggests that most of the observed X-ray column
arises in the warped accretion disk at 0.29 pc, and that the maser emission is
truncated at large radii predominantly as a result of the molecular-to-atomic
phase transition originally proposed by Neufeld & Maloney (1995).",2005-04-19T02:27:25Z
Modelling of the fast rotating delta Scuti star Altair,"We present an asteroseismic study of the fast rotating star HD187642
(Altair), recently discovered to be a delta Scuti pulsator. We have computed
models taking into account rotation for increasing rotational velocities. We
investigate the relation between the fundamental radial mode and the first
overtone in the framework of Petersen diagrams. The effects of rotation on such
diagrams, which become important at rotational velocities above 150 km/s, as
well as the domain of validity of our seismic tools are discussed. We also
investigate the radial and non-radial modes in order to constrain models
fitting the five most dominant observed oscillation modes.",2005-03-16T16:55:43Z
Detection of TeV Gamma-Rays from extended sources with Milagro,"The Milagro gamma-ray observatory employs a water Cherenkov detector to
observe extensive air showers produced by high-energy particles impacting in
the Earth's atmosphere. A 4800 m$^{2}$ pond instrumented with 723 8"" PMTs
detects Cherenkov light produced by secondary air-shower particles. An array of
175 4000 liter water tanks surrounding the central pond detector was recently
added, extending the physical area of the Milagro observatory to 40,000 m$^{2}$
and substantially increasing the sensitivity of the detector. Because of its
wide field of view and high duty cycle, Milagro is ideal for monitoring the
northern sky almost continuously ($>$90% duty cycle) in the 100 GeV to 100 TeV
energy range. Here we discuss the first detection of TeV gamma-rays from the
inner Galactic plane region. We also report the detection of an extended TeV
source coincident with the EGRET source 3EG J0520+2556, as well as the
observation of extended TeV emission from the Cygnus region of the Galactic
plane.",2005-03-10T13:35:16Z
"Spectral properties of Three-dimensional Magneto-hydrodynamical
  Accretion Flows","In spite of a large number of global three-dimensional (3D)
magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of accretion flows and jets being made
recently, their astrophysical relevance for realistic situations is not well
known. In order to examine to what extent the simulated MHD flows can account
for the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*),
for the first time we calculate the emergent spectra from 3D MHD flows in a
wide range of wavelengths (from radio to X-ray) by solving the 3D radiative
transfer equations. We use the simulation data by Kato, Mineshige, and Shibata
(2004) and perform Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations, in which
synchrotron emission/absorption, free-free emission/absorption, and
Compton/inverse Compton scattering are taken into account. We assume two
temperature plasmas and calculate electron temperatures by solving the electron
energy equation. Only thermal electrons are considered. It is found that the 3D
MHD flow generally over-produces X-rays by means of bremsstrahlung radiation
from the regions at large radii. A flatter density profile, r^{-a} with a<1,
than that of the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF), r^{-3/2}, is the
main reason for this. If we restrict the size of the emission region to be as
small as 10r_s, where r_s is the Schwarzschild radius, the MHD model can
reproduce the basic features of the observed SED of Sgr A* during its flaring
state. Yet, the spectrum in the quiescent state remains to be understood. We
also calculate the time-dependent spectral changes, finding that the fluxes
fluctuate in a wide range of the frequency and the flux at each wavelength does
not always vary coherently.",2005-03-31T04:17:40Z
Prompt Mergers of Neutron Stars with Black Holes,"Mergers of neutron stars with black holes have been suggested as candidates
for short gamma-ray bursts. They have also been studied for their potential as
gravitational wave sources observable with ground-based detectors. For these
purposes, it is important to know under what circumstances such a merger could
leave an accretion disk or result in a period of stable mass transfer. We show
that, consistent with recent numerical simulations, it is expected that mergers
between neutron stars and black holes will be prompt, with no accretion disk
and no stable mass transfer, if the black hole has a mass greater than that of
the neutron star and is spinning slowly. The reason is that for comparable
masses, angular momentum loss to gravitational radiation starts a plunge orbit
well outside the innermost stable circular orbit, causing direct merging rather
than extended mass transfer. Even when the black hole is spinning rapidly and
exactly prograde with respect to the orbit, we show that it is possible within
current understanding that no accretion disk will form under any circumstances,
but resolution of this will require full general relativistic numerical
simulations with no approximations.",2005-05-05T11:47:27Z
A Multiplicity Survey of the Rho Ophiuchi Molecular Clouds,"We present a volume-limited multiplicity survey with magnitude cutoff (K =<
10.5 mag) of 158 young stellar objects located within or in the vicinity of the
Rho Ophiuchi Dark Cloud. With exception of eleven already well observed
objects, all sources have been observed by us in the K-band with 3.5m
telescopes by using speckle techniques. The separation range covered by our
survey is [0.13'',6.4''], where the lower limit is given by the diffraction
limit of the telescopes and the upper limit by confusion with background stars.
The multiplicity survey is complete for flux ratios => 0.1 (=< 2.5 mag) at the
diffraction limit. After taking the background density into account the degree
of multiplicity is 29.1%+-4.3% and thus only marginally higher than the value
23.5%+-4.8%derived for the given separation range for the main-sequence
solar-like stars in the solar neighbourhood (Duquennoy & Mayor 1991). We
discuss the implications of these findings.",2005-04-27T12:38:32Z
Modelling Kinematics and Dark Matter: The Halos of Elliptical Galaxies,"This review is focussed on the outer halos of elliptical galaxies. Its
emphasis is on (i) planetary nebulae as test particles to trace the stellar
kinematics at large radii, (ii) the observed angular momentum in elliptical
galaxy halos and its theoretical relevance, (iii) dynamical modelling of
stellar-kinematic data, and (iv) a discussion of the evidence for dark matter
halos in ellipticals from a wide range of measurements.",2005-02-02T12:09:35Z
"Near-Infrared Photometry of the High-Redshift Quasar RDJ030117+002025:
  Evidence for a Massive Starburst at z=5.5","With a redshift of z=5.5 and an optical blue magnitude M_B ~ -24.2 mag (~4.5
10^12 L_sun), RDJ030117+002025 is the most distant optically faint (M_B > -26
mag) quasar known. MAMBO continuum observations at lambda=1.2 mm (185
micrometer rest-frame) showed that this quasar has a far-IR luminosity
comparable to its optical luminosity. We present near-infrared J- and K-band
photometry obtained with NIRC on the Keck I telescope, tracing the slope of the
rest frame UV spectrum of this quasar. The observed spectral index is close to
the value of alpha_nu ~ -0.44 measured in composite spectra of optically-bright
SDSS quasars. It thus appears that the quasar does not suffer from strong dust
extinction, which further implies that its low rest-frame UV luminosity is due
to an intrinsically-faint AGN. The FIR to optical luminosity ratio is then much
larger than that observed for the more luminous quasars, supporting the
suggestion that the FIR emission is not powered by the AGN but by a massive
starburst.",2005-05-06T20:26:50Z
Constraints on hot metals in the Vicinity of the Galaxy,"We have searched for evidence of soft X-ray absorption by hot metals in the
vicinity of the Galaxy in the spectra of a small sample of fifteen Type I AGN
observed with the high resolution X-ray gratings on board Chandra. This is an
extension of our previous survey of hot OVII and OVIII absorbing gas in the
vicinity of the Galaxy. The strongest absorption signatures within a few
hundred km/s of their rest-frame energies are most likely due to warm absorbing
outflows from the nearest AGN, which are back-lighting the local hot gas. We
emphasize that absorption signatures in the spectra of some distant AGN that
are kinematically consistent with the recessional velocity of the AGN are most
likely to be due to hot local gas. Along the sightline towards PG 1211+143, PDS
456 and MCG-6-30-15 there is a very large absorbing Fe column density which is
kinematically consistent with absorption by hot, local Fe. The sightlines to
these three AGN pass through the limb of the Northern Polar Spur (NPS), a local
bubble formed from several supernovae which, if rich in Fe, may account for a
large local Fe column.
  We obtain limits on the column density of local, highly ionized N, Ne, Mg, Si
along all of the sightlines in our sample. We correlate the column density
limits with those of highly ionized O along the same sightlines. Assuming the
hot local gas is in collisionally ionized equilibrium, we obtain limits on the
temperature and relative abundances of the metals in the hot local gas. Our
limits on the ionic column densities in the local hot gas seem to be consistent
with those observed in the hot halo gas of edge-on normal spiral galaxies.",2005-06-15T15:41:19Z
"Spatially Resolved Low Frequency VLA observations of the Supernova
  Remnant 3C 391","We present VLA images of the supernova remnant (SNR) 3C~391 at 74, 330, and
1465 MHz. This remnant has been known for some time to exhibit a turnover in
its integrated radio continuum spectrum at frequencies < 100 MHz, indicative of
free-free absorption from thermal ionized gas along the line of sight. For the
first time, our data reveal the spatially resolved morphology of the low
frequency free-free absorption with a resolution of ~70 arcsec. Contrary to the
expectation that such absorption arises from unrelated low density HII regions
(or their envelopes) along the line of sight, these data suggest that in this
case the absorbing medium is directly linked to the SNR itself. 3C~391 has been
shown in a number of recent papers to be interacting with a molecular cloud.
Indeed, it exhibits a number of signposts of SNR/molecular cloud shocks
including OH (1720 MHz) masers and broad molecular emission lines. Comparison
of the regions of strongest 74 MHz absorption with existing X-ray, IR, and
molecular data suggests that the free-free absorption originates from the
SNR/molecular cloud shock boundaries due to ionized gas created from the
passage of a J-type shock with a speed of ~100 km/s. This makes only the second
SNR for which such (extrinsic) spatially resolved absorption has been measured,
and the only one for which the absorption is thought to arise from a
SNR/molecular cloud interface region.",2005-03-02T23:58:33Z
"Multiwavelength Spectral Models for SNR G347.3-0.5 from Non-Linear Shock
  Acceleration","The remnant G347.3-0.5 exhibits strong shell emission in the radio and X-ray
bands, and has a purported detection in the TeV gamma-ray band by the
CANGAROO-II telescope. The CANGAROO results were touted as evidence for the
production of cosmic ray ions, a claim that has proven controversial due to
constraining fluxes associated with a proximate unidentified EGRET source 3EG
J1714-3857. HESS has now seen this source in the TeV band. The complex
environment of the remnant renders modeling of its broadband spectrum sensitive
to assumptions concerning the nature and parameters of the circumremnant
medium. This paper explores a sampling of reasonable possibilities for
multiwavelength spectral predictions from this source, using a non-linear model
of diffusive particle acceleration at the shocked shell. The magnetic field
strength, shell size and degree of particle cross-field diffusion act as
variables to which the radio to X-ray to gamma-ray signal is sensitive. The
modeling of the extant data constrains these variables, and the potential
impact of the recent HESS detection on such parameters is addressed. Putative
pion decay signals in hard gamma-rays resulting from hadronic interactions in
dense molecular clouds are briefly discussed; the requisite suppression of the
GeV component needed to accommodate the 3EG J1714-3857 EGRET data provides
potential bounds on the diffusive distance from the shell to the proximate
clouds.",2005-03-03T15:12:55Z
"Probing the Magnetic Field at Sub-Parsec Radii in the Accretion Disk of
  NGC 4258","We present an analysis of polarimetric observations at 22 GHz of the water
vapor masers in NGC 4258 obtained with the VLA and the GBT. We do not detect
any circular polarization in the spectrum indicative of Zeeman-induced
splitting of the maser lines of water, a non-paramagnetic molecule. We have
improved the 1-sigma upper limit estimate on the toroidal component of the
magnetic field in the circumnuclear disk of NGC 4258 at a radius of 0.2 pc from
300 mG to 90 mG. We have developed a new method for the analysis of spectra
with blended features and derive a 1-sigma upper limit of 30 mG on the radial
component of the magnetic field at a radius of 0.14 pc. Assuming thermal and
magnetic pressure balance, we estimate an upper limit on the mass accretion
rate of ~10^(-3.7) M_sun/yr for a total magnetic field of less than 130 mG. We
discuss the ramifications of our results on current maser models proposed to
explain the observed maser emission structure and the consequences for current
accretion theories. We find from our magnetic field limits that the thin-disk
model and the jet-disk model are better candidates for accounting for the
extremely low-luminosity nature of NGC 4258, than models that include
advection-dominated accretion flows.",2005-02-11T21:42:28Z
A model for the nonlinear dynamics of turbulent shear flows,"We investigate the nonlinear dynamics of turbulent shear flows, with and
without rotation, in the context of a simple but physically motivated closure
of the equation governing the evolution of the Reynolds stress tensor. We show
that the model naturally accounts for some familiar phenomena in parallel shear
flows, such as the subcritical transition to turbulence at a finite Reynolds
number and the occurrence of a universal velocity profile close to a wall at
large Reynolds number. For rotating shear flows we find that, depending on the
Rayleigh discriminant of the system, the model predicts either linear
instability or nonlinear instability or complete stability as the Reynolds
number is increased to large values. We investigate the properties of
Couette-Taylor flows for varying inner and outer cylinder rotation rates and
identify the region of linear instability (similar to Taylor's), as well as
regions of finite-amplitude instability qualitatively compatible with recent
experiments. We also discuss quantitative predictions of the model in
comparison with a range of experimental torque measurements. Finally, we
consider the relevance of this work to the question of the hydrodynamic
stability of astrophysical accretion discs.",2005-03-09T18:11:55Z
"Constraints on the Process that Regulates the Growth of Supermassive
  Black Holes Based on the Intrinsic Scatter in the M_bh-sigma Relation","We show that the observed scatter in the relations between the mass of
supermassive black holes (SMBHs), M_bh, and the velocity dispersion sigma or
mass M_sph of their host spheroid, place interesting constraints on the process
that regulates SMBH growth in galaxies. When combined with the observed
properties of early-type SDSS galaxies, the observed intrinsic scatters imply
that SMBH growth is regulated by the spheroid velocity dispersion rather than
its mass. The M_bh-M_sph relation is therefore a by-product of a more
fundamental M_bh-sigma relation. We construct a theoretical model for the
scatter among baryon modified dark matter halo profiles, out of which we
generate a population of spheroid hosts and show that these naturally lead to a
relation between effective radius and velocity dispersion of the form R_sph ~
sigma^1.5 with a scatter of ~0.2dex, in agreement with the corresponding
projection of the fundamental plane for early type galaxies in SDSS. At the
redshift of formation, our model predicts the minimum scatter that SMBHs can
have at fixed velocity dispersion or spheroid mass under different formation
scenarios. We also estimate the additional scatter that is introduced into
these relations through collisionless mergers of purely stellar spheroids at
z<1. We find that the observed scatter in the M_bh-sigma and M_bh-M_sph
relations preclude the properties of dark matter halos from being the governing
factor in SMBH growth. Finally, we show that SMBH growth governed by the
properties of the host spheroid can lead to the observed values of scatter in
the M_bh-sigma and M_bh-M_sph relations, only if the SMBH growth is limited by
momentum or energy feedback over the dynamical time of the host spheroid.",2005-06-14T02:05:34Z
"Luminous X-ray Flares from Low Mass X-ray Binary Candidates in the
  Early-Type Galaxy NGC 4697","We report results of the first search specifically targeting short-timescale
X-ray flares from low-mass X-ray binaries in an early-type galaxy. A new method
for flare detection is presented. In NGC 4697, the nearest, optically luminous,
X-ray faint elliptical galaxy, 3 out of 157 sources are found to display flares
at >99.95% probability, and all show more than one flare. Two sources are
coincident with globular clusters and show flare durations and luminosities
similar to (but larger than) Type-I X-ray superbursts found in Galactic neutron
star (NS) X-ray binaries (XRBs). The third source shows more extreme flares.
Its flare luminosity (~6E39 erg/s) is very super-Eddington for an NS and is
similar to the peak luminosities of the brightest Galactic black hole (BH)
XRBs. However, the flare duration (~70 s) is much shorter than are typically
seen for outbursts reaching those luminosities in Galactic BH sources.
Alternative models for the flares are considered.",2005-03-08T21:04:35Z
"FrogEye, the Quantum Coronagraphic mask. The Photon Orbital Angular
  Momentum and its applications to Astronomy","We propose to realize an optical device based on the properties of photon
orbital angular momentum (POAM) to detect the presence of closeby faint
companions in double systems using Laguerre-Gaussian (L-G) modes of the light.
We test also the possibility of using L-G modes to build coronagraph mask. We
realized in the laboratory a prototype using a blazed l=1 hologram to simulate
the separation between two stars, as observed with a telescope, in
Laguerre-Gaussian modes.",2005-05-27T18:35:28Z
Non-linear perturbations in multiple-field inflation,"We develop a non-linear framework for describing long-wavelength
perturbations in multiple-field inflation. The basic variables describing
inhomogeneities are defined in a non-perturbative manner, are invariant under
changes of time slicing on large scales and include both matter and metric
perturbations. They are combinations of spatial gradients generalising the
gauge-invariant variables of linear theory. Dynamical equations are derived and
supplemented with stochastic source terms which provide the long-wavelength
initial conditions determined from short-wavelength modes. Solutions can be
readily obtained via numerical simulations or analytic perturbative expansions.
The latter are much simpler than the usual second-order perturbation theory.
Applications are given in a companion paper.",2005-04-22T19:33:34Z
The Galaxy Populations of Double Cluster RX J1053.7+5735 at z=1.13,"We present a study of the galaxy population in the cluster RX J1053.7+5735,
one of the most distant X-ray selected clusters of galaxies, which also shows
an unusual double-lobed X-ray morphology, indicative of a possible equal-mass
cluster merger. Using Keck-DEIMOS spectroscopic observations of galaxies in the
2x1.5 arcmin region surrounding RX J1053.7+5735, we secured redshifts for six
galaxies in the range 1.129 < z < 1.139, with a mean redshift <z>=1.134. The
mean redshift agrees well with the cluster X-ray redshift previously estimated
from the cluster X-ray Fe-K line, confirming the presence of a cluster at
z~1.135. Galaxies with concordant redshifts are located in both eastern and
western sub-clusters of the double cluster structure, indicating that both
sub-clusters are at similar redshifts. This result is also consistent with a
previous claim that both eastern and western X-ray lobes have similar X-ray
redshifts. Based on their separation of ~ 250 kpc/h, these results support the
interpretation that RX J1053.7+5735 is an equal-mass cluster merger taken place
at z ~ 1, although further direct evidence for dynamical state of the cluster
is needed for a more definitive statement about the cluster merging state. The
six galaxies have a line-of-sight velocity dispersion = 650 km/s. All six
galaxies show clear absorption features of CaII H & K, and several Balmer
lines, typical of early galaxies at the present epoch, in agreement with their
I-K colors. A color-magnitude diagram, constructed from deep optical/NIR
observations of the RX J1053.7+5735 field, shows a clear red color sequence.
There is an indication that the red sequence in RX J1053.7+5735 lies ~ 0.3 to
the blue of the Coma line, qualitatively consistent with previous studies
investigating other clusters at z ~ 1.",2005-02-23T17:14:53Z
"Gravitational cooling and density profile near caustics in collisionless
  dark matter haloes","Cold dark matter haloes are populated by high-density structures with
sharply-peaked profiles known as caustics which have not yet been resolved by
3-dimensional numerical simulations. Here, we derive semi-analytic expressions
for the density profiles near caustics in haloes which form by self-similar
accretions of dark matter with infinitesimal velocity dispersion. A simple
rescaling shows that similarly to the case of absolutely cold medium these
profiles are universal: they are valid for all caustics and irrespective of
physical parameters of the halo. We derive the maximum density of the caustics
and show that it depends on the velocity dispersion and the caustic location.
We show that both the absolute and relative thickness of the caustic
monotonically decrease toward the center of the halo while the maximum density
grows. This indicates that the radial component of the thermal velocities
decreases in the inner streams, i.e. the collisionless medium cools down in the
radial direction descending to the center of the halo. Finally, we demonstrate
that there can be a significant contribution to the emission measure from dark
matter particle annihilation in the caustics.",2005-03-08T14:27:17Z
"Can superhorizon cosmological perturbations explain the acceleration of
  the universe?","We investigate the recent suggestions by Barausse et al. (astro-ph/0501152)
and Kolb et al. (hep-th/0503117) that the acceleration of the universe could be
explained by large superhorizon fluctuations generated by inflation. We show
that no acceleration can be produced by this mechanism. We begin by showing how
the application of Raychaudhuri equation to inhomogeneous cosmologies results
in several ``no go'' theorems for accelerated expansion. Next we derive an
exact solution for a specific case of initial perturbations, for which
application of the Kolb et al. expressions leads to an acceleration, while the
exact solution reveals that no acceleration is present. We show that the
discrepancy can be traced to higher order terms that were dropped in the Kolb
et al. analysis. We proceed with the analysis of initial value formulation of
general relativity to argue that causality severely limits what observable
effects can be derived from superhorizon perturbations. By constructing a
Riemann normal coordinate system on initial slice we show that no infrared
divergence terms arise in this coordinate system. Thus any divergences found
previously can be eliminated by a local rescaling of coordinates and are
unobservable. We perform an explicit analysis of the variance of the
deceleration parameter for the case of single field inflation using usual
coordinates and show that the infrared divergent terms found by Barausse et al.
and Kolb et al. cancel against several additional terms not considered in their
analysis. Finally, we argue that introducing isocurvature perturbations does
not alter our conclusion that the accelerating expansion of the universe cannot
be explained by superhorizon modes.",2005-03-27T21:46:27Z
"The first chemical enrichment in the universe and the formation of hyper
  metal-poor stars","The recent discovery of a hyper metal-poor (HMP) star, whose metallicity Fe/H
is smaller than 1/100,000 of the solar ratio, together with one earlier HMP
star, has raised a challenging question if these HMP stars are the actual first
generation, low mass stars in the Universe. We argue that these HMP stars are
the second generation stars being formed from gases which were chemically
enriched by the first generation supernovae. The key to this solution is the
very unusual abundance patterns of these HMP stars with important similarities
and differences. We can reproduce these abundance features with the
core-collapse ``faint'' supernova models which undergo extensive matter mixing
and fallback during the explosion.",2005-05-26T01:00:10Z
Simulation of the clock framework of Gaia,"Gaia will perform astrometric measurements with an unprecedented resolution.
Consequently, the electronics of the Astro instrument must time tag every
measurement with a precision of a few nanoseconds. Hence, it requires a high
stability clock signal, for which a Rb-type spacecraft master clock has been
baselined. The distribution of its signal and the generation of clock
subproducts must maintain these high accuracy requirements. We have developed a
software application to simulate generic clock frameworks. The most critical
clock structures for Gaia have also been identified, and its master clock has
been parameterised.",2005-04-15T11:39:39Z
"Spectral Formation in X-Ray Pulsars: Bulk Comptonization in the
  Accretion Shock","Accretion-powered X-ray pulsars are among the most luminous X-ray sources in
the Galaxy. However, despite decades of theoretical and observational work
since their discovery, no satisfactory model for the formation of the observed
X-ray spectra has emerged. In particular, the previously available theories are
unable to reproduce the power-law variation observed at high energies in many
sources. In this paper, we present the first self-consistent calculation of the
spectrum emerging from a pulsar accretion column that includes an explicit
treatment of the energization occurring in the shock. Using a rigorous
eigenfunction expansion method based on the exact dynamical solution for the
velocity profile in the column, we obtain a closed-form expression for the
Green's function describing the upscattering of radiation injected into the
column from a monochromatic source located at the top of the thermal mound,
near the base of the flow. The Green's function is convolved with a Planck
distribution to calculate the radiation spectrum resulting from the
reprocessing of blackbody photons emitted by the thermal mound. We demonstrate
that the energization of the photons in the shock naturally produces an X-ray
spectrum with a power-law shape at high energies and a blackbody shape at low
energies, in agreement with many observations of accreting X-ray pulsars.",2005-05-06T15:47:17Z
"Axisymmetric collapse simulations of rotating massive stellar cores in
  full general relativity: Numerical study for prompt black hole formation","We perform axisymmetric simulations for gravitational collapse of a massive
iron core to a black hole in full general relativity. The iron cores are
modeled by $\Gamma = 4/3$ equilibrium polytrope for simplicity and a parametric
equation of state is adopted during the collapse. Performing simulations for a
wide variety of initial conditions changing the mass, the angular momentum, the
rotational velocity profile of the core, and the parameters of the equations of
state (which are chosen so that the maximum mass of the cold spherical
polytrope is $\approx 1.6M_{\odot}$), a criterion for the prompt black hole
formation is clarified in terms of them. It is found that (i) with the increase
of the thermal energy generated by shocks, the threshold mass for the prompt
black hole formation is increased by 20--40%, (ii) the rotational centrifugal
force increases the threshold mass by $\alt 25%$, (iii) with the increase of
the degree of differential rotation, the threshold mass is also increased, and
(iv) the amplification factors shown in the results (i)--(iii) depend
sensitively on the equation of state. We also find that the collapse dynamics
and the structure of the shock formed at the bounce depend strongly on the
stiffness of the adopted equation of state. In particular, as a new feature, a
strong bipolar explosion is observed for the collapse of rapidly rotating iron
cores with an equation of state which is stiff in subnuclear density and soft
in supranuclear density. Gravitational waves are computed in terms of a
quadrupole formula. It is also found that the waveform depends sensitively on
the equations of state.",2005-04-26T07:23:10Z
"Influence of magnification threshold on pixel lensing optical depth,
  event rate and time scale distributions towards M31","Pixel lensing is the gravitational microlensing of light from unresolved
stars contributing to the luminosity flux collected by a single pixel. A star
must be sufficiently magnified, that is, the lens impact parameter must be less
than a threshold value $u_T$ if the excess photon flux in a pixel is to be
detected over the background. Assuming the parameters of the Isaac Newton
Telescope and typical observing conditions, we present maps in the sky plane
towards M31 of threshold impact parameter, optical depth, event number and
event time scale, analyzing in particular how these quantities depend on $u_T$
in pixel lensing searches. We use an analytical approach consisting of
averaging on $u_T$ and the star column density the optical depth, microlensing
rate and event duration time scale. An overall decrease in the expected optical
depth and event number with respect to the classical microlensing results is
found, particularly towards the high luminosity M31 inner regions. As expected,
pixel lensing events towards the inner region of M31 are mostly due to
self-lensing, while in the outer region dark events dominate even for a 20%
MACHO halo fraction. We also find a far-disk/near-disk asymmetry in the
expected event number, smaller than that found by \cite{Kerins04}. Both for
self and dark lensing events, the pixel lensing time scale we obtain is $\simeq
1 - 7$ days, dark events lasting roughly twice as long as self-lensing events.
The shortest events are found to occur towards the M31 South Semisphere. We
also note that the pixel lensing results depend on $<u_T>$ and $<u_T^{~2}>$
values and ultimately on the observing conditions and telescope capabilities.",2005-03-24T12:32:00Z
Intra-day Variability of Sagittarius A* at 3 Millimeters,"We report observations and analysis of flux monitoring of Sagittarius A* at
3-mm wavelength using the OVRO millimeter interferometer over a period of eight
days (2002 May 23-30). Frequent phase and flux referencing (every 5 minutes)
with the nearby calibrator source J1744-312 was employed to control for
instrumental and atmospheric effects. Time variations are sought by computing
and subtracting, from each visibility in the database, an average visibility
obtained from all the data acquired in our monitoring program having similar uv
spacings. This removes the confusing effects of baseline-dependent, correlated
flux interference caused by the static, thermal emission from the extended
source Sgr A West. Few-day variations up to ~20% and intra-day variability of
\~20% and in some cases up to ~40% on few-hour time scales emerge from the
differenced data on SgrA*. Power spectra of the residuals indicate the presence
of hourly variations on all but two of the eight days. Monte Carlo simulation
of red-noise light curves indicates that the hourly variations are well
described by a red-noise power spectrum with P(f) ~ f^(-1). Of particular
interest is a ~2.5 hour variation seen prominently on two consecutive days. An
average power spectrum from all eight days of data reveals noteworthy power on
this time scale. There is some indication that few-hour variations are more
pronounced on days when the average daily flux is highest. We briefly discuss
the possibility that these few-hour variations are due to the dynamical
modulation of accreting gas around the central supermassive black hole, as well
as the implications for the structure of the SgrA* photosphere at 3 mm.
Finally, these data have enabled us to produce a high sensitivity 3-mm map of
the extended thermal emission surrounding SgrA*.",2005-03-06T04:09:07Z
QSO Formation under Coevolution of SMBH and Bulge,"he formation and growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) physically linked
with bulges are considered. We focus on the radiation hydrodynamic process for
the growth of SMBH in the optically thick starburst phase, where radiation from
bulge stars drives the mass accretion on to a galactic center through radiation
drag effect. In the present scenario, the AGN luminosity-dominant phase (QSO
phase) is preceded by the host luminosity-dominat phase, which is called
``proto-QSO phase''. In this phase, there exists the massive dusty disks within
younger bulges. Also, the proto-QSO phase is anticipated by an optically-thick
ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) phase. Furthermore, such radiation
hydrodynamic model has been also applied to disk galaxies. It turns out that
the mass of a SMBH primarily correlates with a bulge component even in a disk
galaxy. Thus, by analogy to proto-QSOs, the BH growing phase in disk galaxies
may have massive dusty disks within younger bulges.",2005-04-08T15:32:27Z
"Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of the exceptional pulsar PSR
  B0628-28","PSR B0628-28 is a radio pulsar which was first detected in the X-ray band by
ROSAT and then later observed with Chandra and XMM-Newton. The Chandra
observation yielded an X-ray luminosity two orders of magnitude higher than
what is expected for spin-powered pulsars, also there were no pulsations
detected. The XMM-Newton observation, however, reveals pulsations at the
expected radio period, P=1.244 s. The simultaneously analyzed spectra also
gives a luminosity (in cgs) Log Lx=30.34, which is ~350 times greater than what
would be expected from the correlation between Lx-Edot.",2005-05-21T23:42:38Z
"On the formation of energy spectra of synchrotron X-rays and inverse
  Compton gamma-rays in binary systems with luminous optical stars","In this paper we study formation broad band energy spectra of electrons due
to synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton (IC) scattering. The effect of
transition of IC cooling from the Thomson regime to the Klein-Nishina regime
can be very significant in the environments where radiation density dominates
over the magnetic field density. We discuss impact of this effect on the
formation of synchrotron and IC radiation components of TeV electrons in binary
systems with very luminous optical stars. Such a scenario can be realized, for
example, at the wind termination shock of the pulsar in PSR B1259-63/SS2883 or
in the jets of microquasars. The calculations are based on the solution of
Boltzmann equation using precise differential Compton cross-section.",2005-03-23T15:38:06Z
"Differential Emission Measure Determination of Collisionally Ionized
  Plasma: II. Application to Hot Stars","In a previous paper we have described a technique to derive constraints on
the differential emission measure (DEM) distribution, a measure of the
temperature distribution, of collisionally ionized hot plasmas from their X-ray
emission line spectra. We apply this technique to the Chandra/HETG spectra of
all of the nine hot stars available to us at the time this project was
initiated. We find that DEM distributions of six of the seven O stars in our
sample are very similar but that theta Ori has an X-ray spectrum characterized
by higher temperatures. The DEM distributions of both of B stars in our sample
have lower magnitudes than those of the O stars and one, tau Sco, is
characterized by higher temperatures than the other, beta Cru. These results
confirm previous work in which high temperatures have been found for theta Ori
and tau Sco and taken as evidence for channeling of the wind in magnetic
fields, the existence of which are related to the stars' youth. Our results
demonstrate the utility of our method for deriving temperature information for
large samples of X-ray emission line spectra.",2005-03-20T01:26:58Z
Oxygen-rich disk in the V778 Cyg system resolved,"Various scenarios have been proposed to explain the presence of silicate
features associated with carbon stars, such as V778 Cyg. We have attempted to
constrain these theories by means of mapping water maser mission from V778 Cyg.
The 22 GHz water maser emission from this star has been mapped using MERLIN
with an astrometric accuracy of 25 mas. The spatially- and
kinematically-resolved maser complex is displaced by about 190 mas from the
position of the C-star as measured 10 years earlier using Tycho. Our
simulations and analysis of available data show that this position difference
is unlikely to be due to proper motion if V778 Cyg is at the assumed distance
of 1.4 kpc. The maser components seem to form a distorted S-shaped structure
extended over 18 mas with a clear velocity gradient. We propose a model which
explains the observed water maser structure as an O-rich warped disk around a
companion of the C-star in V 778 binary system, which is seen almost edge-on.
Analysis of observational data, especially those obtained with MERLIN, suggests
that V778 Cyg (and, by implication, other silicate carbon stars) are binary
systems composed of a C-rich star and a companion which stores circumstellar
O-rich material.",2005-04-15T16:21:47Z
Electromagnetic extraction of energy from Kerr black holes,"We elucidate the `right' process for energy extraction from Kerr black holes
through `FFDE' magnetospheres, free from causality violation. It is shown that
the magnetosphere of a Kerr black hole possesses the double-structure,
consisting of the inner and outer magnetospheres with the pair-creation gap
between them and with respective unipolar batteries at the inner and outer
surfaces of the gap.",2005-06-14T12:04:08Z

"One-armed spiral structure of accretion discs induced by a
  phase-dependent mass transfer in Be/X-ray binaries","We study non-axisymmetric structure of accretion discs in Be/X-ray binaries,
performing three dimensional Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations for a
coplanar system with a short period and a moderate eccentricity. We find that
ram pressure due to the phase-dependent mass transfer from the Be-star disc
excites a one-armed, trailing spiral structure in the accretion disc around the
neutron star. The spiral wave is transient; it is excited around the periastron
passage, when the material is transferred from the Be disc, and is gradually
damped afterwards. The disc changes its morphology from circular to eccentric
with the development of the spiral wave, and then from eccentric to circular
with the decay of the wave during one orbital period. It turns out that the
inward propagation of the spiral wave significantly enhances the mass-accretion
rate onto the neutron star. Thus, the detection of an X-ray luminosity peak
corresponding to the peak in enhanced mass-accretion rate provides
circumstantial evidence that an accretion disc is present in Be/X-ray binaries.",2005-03-03T11:01:29Z
"A stability analysis of radiative shocks in the presence of a transverse
  magnetic field","Radiative shock waves may be subject to a global thermal instability in which
the cooling layer and shock front undergo growing resonant oscillations. For
strong hydrodynamic shocks, the presence of the overstability depends on the
temperature and density indices of power-law cooling functions and the specific
heat ratio, $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$, respectively. Here, we investigate
the stabilising influence of a transverse magnetic field by introducing the
shock Alfv\'en number, $M_a$ as a fourth parameter. We thus investigate the
stability criteria for both molecular and atomic shocks under a wide range of
conditions. In particular, we find that all molecular shocks in which the
cooling increases with the temperature ($\alpha > 0$) are stabilised to the
first four modes if $M_a < 20$ ($\beta = 2$). For $\alpha = -0.5$, the first
overtone remains stable only for $M_a < 8$. We conclude that molecular shocks
in the interstellar medium are probably stabilised by a transverse magnetic
field unless exceptional circumstances arise in which the cooling strongly
increases as the gas cools.",2005-05-03T15:49:10Z
Understanding galaxy formation with ISO deep surveys,"We present the results obtained through the various ISO extragalactic deep
surveys. While IRAS revealed the existence of galaxies forming stars at a rate
of a few tens (LIRGs) or even hundreds (ULIRGs) solar masses in the local
universe, ISO not only discovered that these galaxies were already in place at
redshift one, but also that they are not the extreme objects that we once
believed them to be. Instead they appear to play a dominant role in shaping
present-day galaxies as reflected by their role in the cosmic history of star
formation and in producing the cosmic infrared background detected by the COBE
satellite in the far infrared to sub-millimeter range.",2005-03-17T14:01:57Z
Density scaling and anisotropy in supersonic MHD turbulence,"We study the statistics of density for supersonic turbulence in a medium with
magnetic pressure larger than the gaseous pressure. This study is motivated by
molecular cloud research. Our simulations exhibit clumpy density structures,
which contrast increases with the Mach number. At 10 Machs densities of some
clumps are three orders of magnitude higher than the mean density. These clumps
give rise to flat and approximately isotropic density spectrum corresponding to
the random distribution of clumps in space. We claim that the clumps originate
from our random, isotropic turbulence driving. When the contribution from those
clumps is suppressed by studying logarithm of density, the density statistics
exhibit scale-dependent anisotropy consistent with the models where density
structures arise from shearing by Alfv\'en waves. It is noteworthy that
originally such models were advocated for the case of low-Mach, nearly
incompressible turbulence.",2005-02-25T19:20:53Z
The DEEP Groth Strip Survey. I. The Sample,"The Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Probe (DEEP) is a multi-phase research
program dedicated to the study of the formation and evolution of galaxies and
of large scale structure in the distant Universe. This paper describes the
first five-year phase, denoted DEEP1. A series of ten DEEP1 papers will discuss
a range of scientific topics (e.g., the study of photometric and spectral
properties of a general distant galaxy survey, the evolution observed in galaxy
populations of varied morphologies). The observational basis for these studies
is the Groth Survey Strip field, a 127 square arcminute region which has been
observed with the Hubble Space Telescope in both broad I-band and V-band
optical filters and with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph on the Keck
Telescopes. Catalogs of photometric and structural parameters have been
constructed for 11,547 galaxies and stars at magnitudes brighter than 29, and
spectroscopy has been conducted for a magnitude-color weighted subsample of 818
objects. We evaluate three independent techniques for constructing an imaging
catalog for the field from the HST data, and discuss the depth and sampling of
the resultant catalogs. The selection of the spectroscopic subsample is
discussed, and we describe the multifaceted approach taken to prioritizing
objects of interest for a variety of scientific subprograms. A series of Monte
Carlo simulations then demonstrates that the spectroscopic subsample can be
adequately modeled as a simple function of magnitude and color cuts in the
imaging catalog.",2005-03-17T01:22:05Z
Radial Velocity Studies of Close Binary Stars.X,"Radial-velocity measurements and sine-curve fits to the orbital velocity
variations are presented for the ninth set of ten close binary systems: V395
And, HS Aqr, V449 Aur, FP Boo, SW Lac, KS Peg, IW Per, V592 Per, TU UMi, FO
Vir. The first three are very close, possibly detached, early-type binaries and
all three require further investigation. Particularly interesting is V395 And
whose spectral type is as early as B7/8 for a 0.685 day orbit binary. KS Peg
and IW Per are single-line binaries, with the former probably hosting a very
low mass star. We have detected a low-mass secondary in an important
semi-detached system FO Vir at q=0.125+/-0.005. The contact binary FP Boo is
also a very small mass-ratio system, q=0.106+/-0.005. The other contact
binaries in this group are V592 Per, TU UMi and the well known SW Lac. V592 Per
and TU UMi have bright tertiary companions; for these binaries, and for V395
And, we used a novel technique of the broadening functions arranged into a
2-dimensional image in phase. The case of TU UMi turned out intractable even
using this approach and we have not been able to derive a firm radial velocity
orbit for this binary. Three systems of this group were observed
spectroscopically before: HS Aqr, SW Lac, KS Peg.",2005-03-02T13:42:49Z
Dark Energy - Dark Matter Unification: Generalized Chaplygin Gas Model,"We review the main features of the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) proposal
for unification of dark energy and dark matter and discuss how it admits an
unique decomposition into dark energy and dark matter components once
phantom-like dark energy is excluded. In the context of this approach we
consider structure formation and show that unphysical oscillations or blow-up
in the matter power spectrum are not present. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
dominance of dark energy occurs about the time when energy density fluctuations
start evolving away from the linear regime.",2005-04-12T18:44:06Z
Monte Carlo radiative transfer in SPH density fields,"We combine a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code with an SPH code, so that --
assuming thermal equilibrium -- we can calculate dust-temperature fields,
spectral energy distributions, and isophotal maps, for the individual
time-frames generated by an SPH simulation. On large scales, the radiative
transfer cells (RT cells) are borrowed from the tree structure built by the SPH
code, and are chosen so that their size -- and hence the resolution of the
calculated temperature field -- is comparable with the resolution of the
density field. We refer collectively to these cubic RT cells as the 'global
grid'. The code is tested and found to treat externally illuminated dust
configurations very well. However, when there are embedded discrete sources,
i.e. stars, these produce very steep local temperature gradients which can only
be modelled properly if -- in the immediate vicinity of, and centred on, each
embedded star -- we supplement the global grid with a 'star grid' of closely
spaced concentric RT cells.",2005-05-13T15:23:53Z
"A Self-Absorption Census of Cold HI Clouds in the Canadian Galactic
  Plane Survey","We present a 21cm line HI self-absorption (HISA) survey of cold atomic gas
within Galactic longitudes 75 to 146 degrees and latitudes -3 to +5 degrees. We
identify HISA as spatially and spectrally confined dark HI features and extract
it from the surrounding HI emission in the arcminute-resolution Canadian
Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS). We compile a catalog of the most significant
features in our survey and compare our detections against those in the
literature. Within the parameters of our search, we find nearly all previously
detected features and identify many new ones. The CGPS shows HISA in much
greater detail than any prior survey and allows both new and
previously-discovered features to be placed into the larger context of Galactic
structure. In space and radial velocity, faint HISA is detected virtually
everywhere that the HI emission background is sufficiently bright. This ambient
HISA population may arise from small turbulent fluctuations of temperature and
velocity in the neutral interstellar medium. By contrast, stronger HISA is
organized into discrete complexes, many of which follow a longitude-velocity
distribution that suggests they have been made visible by the velocity reversal
of the Perseus arm's spiral density wave. The cold HI revealed in this way may
have recently passed through the spiral shock and be on its way to forming
molecules and, eventually, new stars. This paper is the second in a series
examining HISA at high angular resolution. A companion paper (Paper III)
describes our HISA search and extraction algorithms in detail.",2005-03-05T00:12:48Z
Energy-dependent variability from accretion flows,"We develop a formalism to calculate energy-dependent fractional variability
(rms) in accretion flows. We consider rms spectra resulting from radial
dependencies of the level of local variability (as expected from propagation of
disturbances in accretion flows) assuming the constant shape of the spectrum
emitted at a given radius. We consider the cases when the variability of the
flow is either coherent or incoherent between different radial zones. As
example local emission, we consider blackbody, Wien and thermal Comptonization
spectra. In addition to numerical results, we present a number of analytical
formulae for the resulting rms. We also find an analytical formula for the disc
Wien spectrum, which we find to be a very good approximation to the disc
blackbody. We compare our results to the rms spectrum observed in an ultrasoft
state of GRS 1915+105.",2005-04-12T15:49:29Z
The Galaxy Distribution Function from the 2MASS Survey,"We determine the spatial distribution function of galaxies from a wide range
of samples in the 2MASS survey. The results agree very well with the form of
the distribution predicted by the theory of cosmological gravitational
many-body galaxy clustering. On large scales we find a value of the clustering
parameter b = 0.867 +/- 0.026, in agreement with b = 0.83 +/- 0.05 found
previously for the Pisces-Perseus supercluster. We measure b(theta) as a
function of scale, since this is a powerful test of the applicability of
computer simulations. The results suggest that when galaxies clustered they
were usually surrounded by individual, rather than by communal haloes.",2005-03-24T13:47:15Z
The length of stellar bars in SB galaxies and N-body simulations,"We have investigated the accuracy and reliability of six methods used to
determine the length of stellar bars in galaxies or N-body simulations. All
these methods use ellipse fitting and Fourier decomposition of the surface
brightness. We have applied them to N-body simulations that include stars, gas,
star formation, and feedback. Stellar particles were photometrically calibrated
to make B and K-band mock images. Dust absorption is also included. We discuss
the advantages and drawbacks of each method, the effects of projection and
resolution, as well as the uncertainties introduced by the presence of dust.
The use of N-body simulations allows us to compare the location of Ultra
Harmonic Resonance (UHR or 4/1) and corotation (CR) with measured bar lengths.
We show that the minimum of ellipticity located just outside the bulk of the
bar is correlated with the corotation, whereas the location of the UHR can be
approximated using the phase of the fitted ellipses or the phase of the m=2
Fourier development of the surface brightness. We give evidence that the
classification of slow/fast bars, based on the ratio R = Rcr/Rbar could
increase from 1 (fast bar) to 1.4 (slow bar) just by a change of method. We
thus conclude that one has to select the right bar-length estimator depending
on the application, since these various estimators do not define the same
physical area.",2005-03-18T02:47:10Z
Rates and Progenitors of Type Ia Supernovae,"The remarkable uniformity of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) has allowed
astronomers to use them as distance indicators to measure the properties and
expansion history of the Universe. However, SNe Ia exhibit intrinsic variation
in both their spectra and observed brightness. To reduce these systematic
uncertainties, we need a deeper understanding of the observed variations in SNe
Ia. Toward this end, the Nearby Supernova Factory (SNfactory) has been designed
to discover hundreds of SNe Ia in a systematic and automated fashion and study
them in detail.
  A prototype run of the SNfactory search pipeline conducted from 2002 to 2003
discovered 83 SNe at a final rate of 12 SNe/month. A large, homogeneous search
of this scale offers an excellent opportunity to measure the rate of SNe Ia.
This dissertation presents a new method for analyzing the true sensitivity of a
multi-epoch supernova search and finds a SN Ia rate from $z\sim0.01$--0.1 of
$r_V = 4.26 (+1.39 -1.93) (+0.10 - 0.10)$ SNe Ia/yr/Mpc$^3$ from a preliminary
analysis of a subsample of the SNfactory prototype search.
  Several unusual supernovae were found in the course of the SNfactory
prototype search. One in particular, SN 2002ic, was the first SN Ia to exhibit
convincing evidence for a circumstellar medium and offers valuable insight into
the progenitors of SNe Ia.",2005-05-30T17:35:07Z
Ultra-Low Amplitude Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud,"The MACHO variables of LMC Field 77 that lie in the vicinity of the Cepheid
instability strip are reexamined. Among the 144 variables that we identify as
Cepheids we find 14 that have Fourier amplitudes <0.05 mag in the MACHO red
band, of which 7 have an amplitude <0.006 mag : we dub the latter group of
stars ultra-low amplitude (ULA) Cepheids. The variability of these objects is
verified by a comparison of the MACHO red with the MACHO blue lightcurves and
with those of the corresponding OGLE LMC stars. The occurrence of ULA Cepheids
is in agreement with theory. We have also discovered 2 low amplitude variables
whose periods are about a factor of 5--6 smaller than those of F Cepheids of
equal apparent magnitude. We suggest that these objects are Cepheids undergoing
pulsations in a surface mode and that they belong to a novel class of Strange
Cepheids (or Surface Mode Cepheids) whose existence was predicted by Buchler et
al. (1997).",2005-06-06T15:38:41Z
"Dating the stellar population in massive early-type galaxies at
  $z\sim$1.5","We present the analysis of 10 massive early-type galaxies at $z\sim1.5$. They
have been identified by means of a near-IR low resolution spectroscopic
follow-up of a complete sample of 36 bright (K' $<$ 18.5) Extremely Red Objects
(EROs, R-K'$>$ 5) selected from the Munich Near-IR ClusterSurvey (MUNICS; Drory
et al. 2001). The low resolution near-IR spectra constrain their redshift at
$1.2<z<1.7$, implying absolute magnitudes M$_{K'}<-26.0$ and stellar masses
well in excess of 10$^{11}$ M$_\odot$. Under the hypothesis of pure passive
evolution from $z\sim1.5$ to $z=0$, in the local universe they would have
luminosities L$_K\ge2.5$L$^*$. Thus, they are the high-z counterparts of the
local old massive (10$^{11}-10^{12}$ M$_\odot$) early-type galaxies populating
the bright end of the local luminosity function of galaxies. The comparison of
their spectro-photometric properties with a grid of synthetic models suggests
that the stellar populations in more than half of the sample are about
$\sim$3-5 Gyr old and 1-2 Gyr old in the remaining part. These ages imply
formation redshift $z_{f} > 2$ for all the galaxies and $z_{f} \geq 4$ for the
oldest ones. The comparison of the 4000\AA break and of the overall spectral
shape of the average spectrum of the 10 galaxies at $z\sim1.5$ with those of
their local counterpartsconfirms that field massive early-type galaxies formed
the bulk of their stellar mass at $2<z<4$, most likely over a short ($<$ 1 Gyr)
star formation time scale, consistently with the results derived from the
analysis of their individual spectro-photometric properties.",2005-05-23T06:56:56Z
Infrared Spectroscopy of U Equulei's Warm Circumstellar Gas,"Medium and high resolution spectroscopy of U Equulei from 1 to 4 microns
during 1997-2003 has revealed information about its unusual circumstellar
envelope, observed previously at optical and radio wavelengths. Strong
absorption bands of H2O and of CO dominate the 1-4um spectrum. The gas has a
mean temperature of 600 K and 12C/13C =< 10. The CO 2-0 line profiles and
velocities imply no net ejection or infall and indicate either rapid radial gas
motions being seen along a narrow continuum beam, or absorption by orbiting gas
that is nearly coincident with a highly extended continuum source. The gas
could be located in a disk-like structure. The observed high column densities
of warm CO and H2 normally would be associated with sufficient dust to
completely obscure the star at optical wavelengths. The observations thus

"VLT-SINFONI observations of Mrk 609 - A showcase for X-ray active
  galaxies chosen from a sample of AGN suitable for adaptive optics
  observations with natural guide stars","We will present first results of ESO-VLT AO-assisted integral-field
spectroscopy of a sample of X-ray bright AGN with redshifts of 0.04 < z < 1. We
constructed this sample by cross-correlating the SDSS and ROSAT surveys and
utilizing typical AO constraints. This sample allows for a detailed study of
the NIR properties of the nuclear and host environments with high spectral
resolution on the 100 pc scale. These objects can then be compared directly to
the local (z<0.01) galaxy populations (observed without AO) at the same linear
scale. As a current example, we will present observations of the z=0.034
Seyfert 1.8 galaxy Mrk 609 with the new AO-assisted integral-field spectrometer
SINFONI at the VLT. The successful observations show, that in the future -
while having observed more objects - we will be able to determine the presence,
frequency and importance of nuclear bars and/or circum-nuclear star forming
rings in these objects and address the question of how these X-ray luminous AGN
and their hosts are linked to optically/UV-bright QSOs, low-z QSOs/radio
galaxies, or ULIRGs.",2005-06-15T20:49:20Z
Comments on the proposal of Dark Energy Stars by Chapline,"We point out that the contentions of Chapline (astro-ph/0503200)[1] that (i)
General Relativity (GR) is in conflict with Quantum Mechanics (QM) and (ii) GR
fails even on macroscopic length scales are incorrect and based on (i)
misunderstanding of GR and (ii) completely misconceived ``thought
experiments''. Even without introduction of any QM, GR actually does not allow
formation of any Event Horizon and is competent to figure out the actual nature
of the supposed Black Hole candidates. The resultant picture is not in conflict
with QM at all.",2005-04-18T12:57:09Z
"Final results of the EDELWEISS-I dark matter search with cryogenic

heat-and-ionization Ge detectors are presented. The final data sample
corresponds to an increase by a factor five in exposure relative to the
previously published results. A recoil energy threshold of 13 keV or better was

Lensed CMB simulation and parameter estimation,"Modelling of the weak lensing of the CMB will be crucial to obtain correct
cosmological parameter constraints from forthcoming precision CMB anisotropy
observations. The lensing affects the power spectrum as well as inducing
non-Gaussianities. We discuss the simulation of full sky CMB maps in the weak
lensing approximation and describe a fast numerical code. The series expansion
in the deflection angle cannot be used to simulate accurate CMB maps, so a
pixel remapping must be used. For parameter estimation accounting for the
change in the power spectrum but assuming Gaussianity is sufficient to obtain
accurate results up to Planck sensitivity using current tools. A fuller
analysis may be required to obtain accurate error estimates and for more
sensitive observations. We demonstrate a simple full sky simulation and
subsequent parameter estimation at Planck-like sensitivity. The lensed CMB
simulation and parameter estimation codes are publicly available.",2005-02-22T21:46:04Z
An Initial Look at the FIR-Radio Correlation within M51a using Spitzer,"We present an initial look at the FIR-radio correlation within the
star-forming disk of M51a using {\it Spitzer} MIPS imaging, observed as part of
the {\it Spitzer} Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS), and WSRT radio
continuum data. At an estimated distance of 8.2 Mpc, we are able to probe the
variations in the 70$\micron$/22cm ratios across the disk of M51a at a linearly
projected scale of 0.75 kpc. We measure a dispersion of 0.191 dex, comparable
to the measured dispersion of the global FIR-radio correlation. Such little
scatter in the IR/radio ratios across the disk suggests that we have yet to
probe physical scales small enough to observe a breakdown in the correlation.
We also find that the global 70$\micron$/22cm ratio of M51a is 25% larger than
the median value of the disk, suggesting that the brighter disk regions drive
the globally measured ratio.",2005-03-04T21:22:19Z
"Variability of Optical \ion{Fe}{ii} Complex in Narrow-Line Seyfert 1
  Galaxy NGC 4051","The variability of optical FeII blends in NGC 4051 is examined from spectra
extracted from the AGN Watch program.In our analysis, the FeII complex are
subtracted and measured with the following results. Firstly, the FeII
variations were detected in NGC 4051 during a 3-year period. The identified
FeII variations followed the variations in continuum closely. Secondly, the EW
of FeII is reported to increase with the rising continuum flux, which is
consistent with previous claims that there is no convincing Baldwin Effect in
optical FeII. Thirdly, by comparing the variations of H$\beta$ and FeII, we
find that RFe scales with continuum flux as $\rm{R_{Fe}\propto (5.0\pm0.8)
\log(L/M)}$, which is significantly different from the theoretical
expectations. Finally, in six selected Seyferts, four out of five Narrow-Line
Seyfert 1 galaxies present positive correlation between RFe and the continuum
flux. The negative correlations are identified in the remaindng two objects
that have relatively broad profiles of H$\beta$ ($\rm{FWHM>1500 km\
s^{-1}}$).We argue that the difference of electron density of broad line clouds
and/or variability behavior of incident high-energy radiation can explain the
dichotomy in variability behavior of RFe.",2005-04-05T17:45:26Z
A climatic thermostat making Earth habitable,"The mean surface temperature on Earth and other planets with atmospheres is
determined by the radiative balance between the non-reflected incoming solar
radiation and the outgoing long-wave black-body radiation from the atmosphere.
The surface temperature is higher than the black-body temperature due to the
greenhouse warming. Balancing the ice-albedo cooling and the greenhouse warming
gives rise to two stable climate states. A cold climate state with a
completelyice-covered planet, called Snowball Earth, and a warm state similar
to our present climate where greenhouse warming prevents the total glacition.
The warm state has dominated Earth in most of its geological history despite a
30 % fainter young Sun. The warming could have been controlled by a greenhouse
thermostat operating by temperature control of the weathering process depleting
the atmosphere from $CO_2$. This temperature control has permitted life to
evolve as early as the end of the heavy bombartment 4 billion years ago.",2005-05-12T09:39:35Z
"The X-ray Position and Optical Counterpart of the Accretion-Powered
  Millisecond Pulsar XTE J1814-338","We report the precise optical and X-ray localization of the 3.2 ms
accretion-powered X-ray pulsar XTE J1814-338 with data from the Chandra X-Ray
Observatory as well as optical observations conducted during the 2003 June
discovery outburst. Optical imaging of the field during the outburst of this
soft X-ray transient reveals an R = 18 star at the X-ray position. This star is
absent (R > 20) from an archival 1989 image of the field and brightened during
the 2003 outburst, and we therefore identify it as the optical counterpart of
XTE J1814-338. The best source position derived from optical astrometry is R.A.
= 18h13m39.s04, Dec.= -33d46m22.3s (J2000). The featureless X-ray spectrum of
the pulsar in outburst is best fit by an absorbed power-law (with photon index
= 1.41 +- 0.06) plus blackbody (with kT = 0.95 +- 0.13 keV) model, where the
blackbody component contributes approximately 10% of the source flux. The
optical broad-band spectrum shows evidence for an excess of infrared emission
with respect to an X-ray heated accretion disk model, suggesting a significant
contribution from the secondary or from a synchrotron-emitting region. A
follow-up observation performed when XTE J1814-338 was in quiescence reveals no
counterpart to a limiting magnitude of R = 23.3. This suggests that the
secondary is an M3 V or later-type star, and therefore very unlikely to be
responsible for the soft excess, making synchroton emission a more reasonable
candidate.",2005-03-30T20:16:24Z
"Spitzer Observations of CO2 Ice Towards Field Stars in the Taurus
  Molecular Cloud","We present the first Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph observations of the 15.2
micron bending mode of CO2 ice towards field stars behind a quiescent dark
cloud. CO2 ice is detected towards 2 field stars (Elias 16, Elias 3) and a
single protostar (HL Tau) with anabundance of ~15-20% relative to water ice.
CO2 ice is not detected towards the source with lowest extinction in our
sample, Tamura 17 (A_V = 3.9m). A comparison of the Elias 16 spectrum with
laboratory data demonstrates that the majority of CO2 ice is embedded in a
polar H2O-rich ice component, with ~15% of CO2 residing in an apolar H2O-poor
mantle. This is the first detection of apolar CO2 towards a field star. We find
that the CO2 extinction threshold is A_V = 4m +/- 1m, comparable to the
threshold for water ice, but significantly less than the threshold for CO ice,
the likely precursor of CO2. Our results confirm CO2 ice forms in tandem with
H2O ice along quiescent lines of sight. This argues for CO2 ice formation via a
mechanism similar to that responsible for H2O ice formation, viz. simple
catalytic reactions on grain surfaces.",2005-05-17T11:21:19Z

"A Radio Counterpart for the Unidentified TeV Source HESS J1813-178: The
  Radio-Gamma-Ray Connection","We discovered independently the shell-type supernova remnant G12.82-0.02,
recently reported by Brogan et al. (2005), which is coincident with the
unidentified TeV gamma-ray source revealed in the HESS survey of the Galactic
plane. Estimating the ambient starlight at the location of this source from the
integrated Ly alpha luminosity of the nearby H II region W33, we conclude that
inverse Compton emission is a viable explanation for the observed TeV emission.
Examining remnants in the survey of Aharonian et al. (2005a) including those
detected above 200 Gev and those not detected, we find a strikingly large range
of more than three orders of magnitude in the radio to TeV flux ratios. We
briefly explore the possible explanations of this range and the implications
for the TeV emission mechanism.",2005-05-18T20:17:53Z
"Structural Parameters of Dwarf Galaxies in the Coma Cluster: On the
  Origin of dS0 Galaxies","In this paper we analyze the structural parameters of the dwarf galaxies in
the Coma cluster with $-18 \le M_{B} \le -16$ and classify them in two types:
those with surface brightness profiles well fitted by a single Sersic law were
called dwarf ellipticals (dEs), and those fitted with Sersic-plus-exponential
profiles were classified as dwarf lenticulars (dS0s). The comparison of the
structural parameters of the dwarf galaxies in the Coma and Virgo clusters
shows that they are analogous. Photometrically, the dE and dS0 galaxies in Coma
are equivalent, having similar colors and global scales. However, the scale of
the innermost parts (bulges) of dS0 galaxies is similar to the bulges of
late-type spiral galaxies. In contrast, dEs have larger scales than the bulges
of bright galaxies. This may indicate that dS0 and dE galaxies have different
origins. While dE galaxies can come from dwarf irregulars (dIs) or from similar
processes as bright Es, the origin of dS0 galaxies can be harassed bright
late-type spiral galaxies.",2005-04-25T15:40:23Z
INTEGRAL High Energy Observations of 2S 0114+65,"We report the first INTEGRAL timing and spectral analysis of the high mass
X-ray binary source 2S 0114+65 at high energies (5-100 keV). The pulse period
was found at 2.668 hr with a high pulsed fraction, ~80% in both the 20-40 keV
and 40-80 keV energy bands. The spin-up trend over ~8 years was measured to be
-8.9 * 10^{-7}. The hard X-ray spectrum obtained with JEM-X/ISGRI is well
described by a high energy exponential cut-off power law model where the
estimated luminosity is 1.8 * 10^{36} erg/s in the 5-100 keV energy band, for a
source distance of 7.2 kpc. We tentatively identify a cyclotron resonance
scattering feature at ~22 keV with one harmonic, implying a magnetic field of
2.5 * 10^{12} G.",2005-04-28T13:52:15Z
"Modeling Accelerated Pick-up Ion Distributions at an Interplanetary
  Shock","The acceleration of interstellar pick-up ions as well as solar wind species
has been observed at a multitude of interplanetary (IP) shocks by different
spacecraft. The efficiency of injection of the pick-up ion component differs
from that of the solar wind, and is expected to be strongly enhanced at highly
oblique and quasi-perpendicular shock events, in accord with inferences from
{\it in situ} observations. This paper explores theoretical modeling of the
phase space distributions of accelerated ions obtained by the Ulysses mission
for the Day 292, 1991 shock associated with a corotating interaction region,
encountered before Ulysses' fly-by of Jupiter. A Monte Carlo simulation is used
to model the acceleration process, adapting a technique that has been
successfully tested on earlier IP shocks possessing minimal pick-up ion
presence. Phase space distributions from the simulation technique for various
low mass ions are compared with SWICS and HI-SCALE data to deduce values of a
``turbulence parameter'' that controls the efficiency of injection, and the
degree of cross-field diffusion. Acceptable fits are obtained for the $H^+$ and
$He^+$ populations using standard prescriptions for the pick-up ion
distribution; $He^{++}$ spectral data was only fit well for scenarios very
close to the Bohm diffusion limit. It is also found that the simulation
successfully accounts for the observation of energetic protons farther upstream
of the forward shock than lower energy pick-up protons, using the same
turbulence parameter that is required to achieve reasonable spectral fits.",2005-05-27T23:36:25Z
Improved Templates for Photometric Redshifts of Submm Sources,"There is growing evidence that some star-forming galaxies at z>1 are
characterized by high efficiencies and specific star formation rates. In the
local universe, these traits are shared by ``active'' Blue Compact Dwarf
galaxies (BCDs) with compact and dense star-forming regions. The Spectral
Energy Distributions (SEDs) of these BCDs are dominated by young massive star
clusters, embedded in a cocoon of dust. In this Letter, we incorporate these
BCD SEDs as templates for two samples of high-redshift galaxy populations
selected at submm wavelengths. Because of the severe absorption of the optical
light, the featureless mid-infrared spectrum, and the relatively flat radio
continuum, the dusty star-cluster SEDs are good approximations to most of the
submm sources in our samples. In most cases, the active BCD SEDs fit the
observed photometric points better than the ``standard'' templates, M 82 and
Arp 220, and predict photometric redshifts significantly closer to the
spectroscopic ones. Our results strongly suggest that the embedded dusty star
clusters in BCD galaxies are superior to other local templates such as M 82 and
Arp 220 in fitting distant submm starburst galaxies.",2005-05-06T15:45:51Z
Mixed Morphology Pairs as a Breeding Ground for Active Nuclei,"Mixed morphology pairs offer a simplification of the interaction equation
that involves a gas-rich fast rotator paired with a gas-poor slow rotator. In
past low resolution IRAS studies it was assumed that the bulk of the far
infrared emission originated in the spiral component. However our ISO studies
revealed a surprising number of early-type components with significant IR
emission some of which turned out to show active nuclei. This motivated us to
look at the current statistics of active nuclei in mixed pairs using the
FIR-radio continuum correlation as a diagnostic. We find a clear excess of
early-type components with radio continuum emission and an active nucleus. We
suggest that they arise more often in mixed pairs via cross fueling of gas from
the spiral companion. This fuel is more efficiently channeled into the nucleus
of the slow rotating receptor. In a sample of 112 mixed-morphology pairs from
the Karachentsev catalog we find that about 25-30% of detected mixed pairs show
a displacement from the radio-FIR relation defined by normal star forming
galaxies. The latter objects show excess radio continuum emission while others
extend the relation to unusually high radio and FIR flux levels. Many of the
outliers/extreme emitters involve an early-type component with an active
nucleus. The paired E/S0 galaxies in the sample exhibit a significant excess
detection fraction and a marginal excess luminosity distribution compared to
isolated unpaired E/S0 galaxies.",2005-02-22T16:44:23Z
"A Chandra HETGS Spectral Study of the Iron K Bandpass in MCG-6-30-15: A
  Narrow View of the Broad Iron Line","We present a high resolution X-ray spectrum of the iron K bandpass in
MCG-6-30-15 based on a 522 ksec observation with Chandra's High Energy
Transmission Grating Spectrometer. The Chandra spectrum is consistent with the
presence of a relativistically broadened, highly redshifted iron K alpha
emission line with a similar profile to previous observations. A number of
narrow features are detected above 2 keV, including a narrow Fe K alpha
emission line and narrow absorption lines from H- and He-like Fe, H-like S and
H-like Si. This absorption is well described by a photoionized plasma with a
column density log N_H = 23.2 and an ionization parameter log xi = 3.6,
assuming the iron abundance has the Solar value and a velocity dispersion
parameter b = 100 km/s. Applying this absorption model to a high fidelity
XMM-Newton EPIC-pn spectrum we find that a broad iron line is still required
with emission extending to within 1.9 gravitational radii of the black hole. If
the iron line comes from an accretion disk truncated at the innermost stable
circular orbit, this indicates that the black hole must be spinning rapidly
with a>0.95. Ionized absorption models attempting to explain the 3-6 keV
spectral curvature without strong gravity predict absorption lines in the
6.4-6.6 keV range that are inconsistent with the Chandra spectrum. The H- and
He-like iron absorption lines in the Chandra spectrum are blueshifted by 2.0
(+0.7/-0.9) x 10^3 km/s compared to the source frame, and may originate in a
high velocity, high ionization component of the warm absorber outflow. This
high ionization component may dominate the energy budget of the outflow, and
account for a significant fraction of the outflowing mass. (Abstract
truncated).",2005-06-03T16:10:13Z
Search for Cosmic-Ray Antideuterons,"We performed a search for cosmic-ray antideuterons using data collected
during four BESS balloon flights from 1997 to 2000. No candidate was found. We
derived, for the first time, an upper limit of 1.9E-4 (m^2 s sr

95% confidence level, between 0.17 and 1.15 GeV/nucleon at the top of the

"L-band (3.5 micron) IR-excess in massive star formation, I. 30 Doradus","L-band data of 30 Doradus at 3.5 micron taken with SPIREX (South Pole
Infrared Explorer) is presented. The photometry was combined with 2MASS JHK
data at 1.25-2.2 micron. Colour-colour and colour-magnitude diagrams are
constructed and used to determine the sources with infrared excess. These are
interpreted as circumstellar disks, and enable the fraction of sources with
disks (the cluster disk fraction or CDF) to be determined. We find that ~42% of
the sources detected at L-band in 30 Doradus have an IR-excess.",2005-04-27T15:16:21Z
"GRAPE-SPH Chemodynamical Simulation of Elliptical Galaxies II: Scaling
  Relations and the Fundamental Plane","We simulate the formation and chemodynamical evolution of 128 elliptical
galaxies using a GRAPE-SPH code that includes various physical processes that
are associated with the formation of stellar systems: radiative cooling, star
formation, feedback from Type II and Ia supernovae and stellar winds, and
chemical enrichment. We find that the star formation timescale controls when
and where stars form in the contracting gas cloud, determines the effective
radius at given mass, and is constrained by observation to be ten times longer
than the local dynamical timescale. We succeed in reproducing the observed
global scaling relations under our CDM-based scenario, e.g., the Faber-Jackson
relation, the Kormendy relation, and the fundamental plane. An intrinsic
scatter exists along the fundamental plane, and the origin of this scatter lies
in differences in merging history. Galaxies that undergo major merger events
tend to have larger effective radii and fainter surface brightnesses, which
result in larger masses, smaller surface brightnesses, and larger mass-to-light
ratios. We can also reproduce the observed colour-magnitude and
mass-metallicity relations, although the scatter is larger than observed. The
scatter arises because feedback is not very effective and star formation does
not terminate completely in our simulations. ~25% of accreted baryons are blown
away in the simulations, independent of the assumed star formation timescale
and initial mass function. Most heavy elements end up locked into stars in the
galaxy. The ejected metal fraction depends only on the star formation
timescale, and is ~2% even to rapid star formation.",2005-06-04T16:28:09Z
A Minor Axis Surface Brightness Profile for M31,"We use data from the Isaac Newton Telescope Wide Field Camera survey of M31
to determine the surface brightness profile of M31 along the south-east minor
axis. We combine surface photometry and faint red giant branch star counts to
trace the profile from the innermost regions out to a projected radius of 4
degrees (~55 kpc) where the V-band surface brightness is 32 mag per square
arcsec; this is the first time the M31 minor axis profile has been mapped over
such a large radial distance using a single dataset. We confirm the finding by
Pritchet & van den Bergh (1994) that the minor axis profile can be described by
a single de Vaucouleurs law out to a projected radius of 1.4 degrees or ~20
kpc. Beyond this, the surface brightness profile flattens considerably and is
consistent with either a power-law of index -2.3 or an exponential of
scalelength 14 kpc. The fraction of the total M31 luminosity contained in this
component is ~2.5%. While it is tempting to associate this outer component with
a true Population II halo in M31, we find that the mean colour of the stellar
population remains approximately constant at V-i~1.6 from 0.5-3.5 degrees along
the minor axis. This result suggests that the same metal-rich stellar
population dominates both structural components.",2005-05-04T16:48:29Z
"On the Parameters determining the Neutrino Flux from observed Active
  Galactic Nuclei","Extrapolating from a sample of 39 AGNs, we examine the impact on the total
number of high energy muon-neutrino induced events (PeV-EeV) expected in
IceCube (a 1Km^3 ``neutrino telescope''), due to variations in different
parameters involved in the neutrino flux, such as the emission region geometry,
the estimation models and distributions of the Doppler factor and the
variability time. This work has been done taking into account different limits
of the extragalactic neutrino flux.
  Among our conclusions, we find, in the case of the largest variability time,
that the cylindrical geometry hypothesis for the emission region, produce a
separation of 3 sigma in the total number of events relative to the spherical
hypothesis. In addition, for similar choices of the burst time, spherical
geometry and for the upper neutrino flux bound, we obtain a separation of 2.5
sigma in the total number of events, for some of the Doppler factor
estimations. These differences are undistinguishable for other input values.",2005-04-25T18:59:17Z
"The Sensitivity of Multidimensional Nova Calculations to the Outer
  Boundary Conditions","Multidimensional reactive flow models of accreted hydrogen rich envelopes on
top of degenerate cold white dwarfs are very effective tools for the study of
critical, non spherically symmetric, behaviors during the early stages of nova
outbursts. Such models can shed light both on the mechanism responsible for the
heavy element enrichment observed to characterize nova envelope matter and on
the role of perturbations during the early stages of ignition of the runaway.
The complexity of convective reactive flow in multi-dimensions makes the
computational model itself complex and sensitive to the details of the
numerics. In this study, we demonstrate that the imposed outer boundary
condition can have a dramatic effect on the solution. Several commonly used
choices for the outer boundary conditions are examined. It is shown that the
solutions obtained from Lagrangian simulations, where the envelope is allowed
to expand and mass is being conserved, are consistent with spherically
symmetric solutions. In Eulerian schemes which utilize an outer boundary
condition of free outflow, the outburst can be artificially quenched.",2005-04-03T16:58:04Z
Deposing the Cool Corona of KPD 0005+5106,"The ROSAT PSPC pulse height spectrum of the peculiar He-rich hot white dwarf
KPD 0005+5106 provided a great surprise when first analysed by Fleming, Werner
& Barstow (1993). It defied the best non-LTE modelling attempts in terms of
photospheric emission from He-dominated atmospheres including C, N and O and
was instead interpreted as the first evidence for a coronal plasma around a
white dwarf. We show here that a recent high resolution Chandra LETGS spectrum
has more structure than expected from a thermal bremsstrahlung continuum and
lacks the narrow lines of H-like and He-like C expected from a coronal plasma.
Moreover, a coronal model requires a total luminosity more than two orders of
magnitude larger than that of the star itself. Instead, the observed 20-80 AA
flux is consistent with photospheric models containing trace amounts of heavier
elements such as Fe. The soft X-ray flux is highly sensitive to the adopted
metal abundance and provides a metal abundance diagnostic. The weak X-ray
emission at 1 keV announced by O'Dwyer et al (2003) instead cannot arise from
the photosphere and requires alternative explanations. We echo earlier
speculation that such emission arises in a shocked wind. Despite the presence
of UV-optical O VIII lines from transitions between levels n=7-10, no X-ray O
VIII Ly alpha flux is detected. We show that O VIII Lyman photons can be
trapped by resonant scattering within the emitting plasma and destroyed by
photoelectric absorption.",2005-02-02T21:07:34Z
Cosmological perturbations in multiple-field inflation,"We analyze cosmological perturbations to the linear order in the context of
inflation with an arbitrary number of scalar fields. The fields take values on
a non-trivial manifold with a positive-definite metric and are non-minimally
coupled to Einstein gravity. The perturbations are decomposed into three
different types. The scalar-type perturbations are presented in a gauge-ready
form without fixing the temporal gauge condition, as well as in terms of
gauge-invariant variables. The gauge-ready method enables us to impose
different gauge conditions which are most suitable to the problem at hand. We
quantize the scalar perturbations and obtain the solutions.",2005-06-15T06:28:39Z
Variability of Fe II Emission Features in the Seyfert 1 Galaxy NGC 5548,"We study the low-contrast Fe II emission blends in the ultraviolet
(1250--2200A) and optical (4000--6000A) spectra of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC
5548 and show that these features vary in flux and that these variations are
correlated with those of the optical continuum. The amplitude of variability of
the optical Fe II emission is 50% - 75% that of Hbeta and the ultraviolet Fe II
emission varies with an even larger amplitude than Hbeta. However, accurate
measurement of the flux in these blends proves to be very difficult even using
excellent Fe II templates to fit the spectra. We are able to constrain only
weakly the optical Fe II emission-line response timescale to a value less than
several weeks; this upper limit exceeds all the reliably measured emission-line
lags in this source so it is not particularly meaningful. Nevertheless, the
fact that the optical Fe II and continuum flux variations are correlated
indicates that line fluorescence in a photoionized plasma, rather than
collisional excitation, is responsible for the Fe II emission. The iron
emission templates are available upon request.",2005-02-21T21:01:27Z
"Polarimetric Observations of 15 Active Galactic Nuclei at High
  Frequencies: Jet Kinematics from Bimonthly Monitoring with the Very Long
  Baseline Array","We present total and polarized intensity images of 15 active galactic nuclei
obtained with the Very Long Baseline Array at 7 mm at 17 epochs from 1998 March
to 2001 April. At some epochs the images are accompanied by nearly simultaneous
polarization measurements at 3 mm, 1.35/0.85 mm, and optical wavelengths. Here
we analyze the 7 mm images to define the properties of the jets of two radio
galaxies, five BL Lac objects, and eight quasars on angular scales $\gtrsim
0.1$ milliarcseconds. We determine the apparent velocities of 106 features in
the jets; for many of the features we derive Doppler factors using a new method
based on comparison of timescale of decline in flux density with the
light-travel time across the emitting region. This allows us to estimate the
Lorentz factors, intrinsic brightness temperatures, and viewing angles of 73
superluminal knots, as well as the opening angle of the jet for each source. We
analyze the derived physical parameters of the jets. In nine sources we detect
statistically meaningful deviations from ballistic motion, with the majority of
components accelerating with distance from the core. In six sources we identify
jet features with characteristics of trailing shocks that form behind the
primary strong perturbations in jet simulations. The apparent speeds of these

the underlying jet.",2005-02-24T00:56:42Z
The earliest spectroscopy of the GRB 030329 afterglow with 6-m telescope,"The earliest BTA (SAO RAS 6-m telescope) spectroscopic observations of the
GRB 030329 optical transient (OT) are presented, which almost coincide in time
with the ""first break"" ($t\sim 0.5$ day after the GRB) of the OT light curve.
The beginning of spectral changes are seen as early as $\sim 10-12$ hours after
the GRB. So, the onset of the spectral changes for $t<1$ day indicates that the
contribution from Type Ic supernova (SN) into the OT optical flux can be
detected earlier. The properties of early spectra of GRB 030329/SN 2003dh can
be consistent with a shock moving into a stellar wind formed from the pre-SN.
Such a behavior (similar to that near the UV shock breakout in SNe) can be
explained by the existence of a dense matter in the immediate surroundings of
massive stellar GRB/SN progenitor). The urgency is emphasized of observation of
early GRB/SN spectra for solving a question that is essential for understanding
GRB physical mechanism: {\it Do all} long-duration gamma-ray bursts are caused
by (or physically connected to) {\it ordinary} core-collapse supernovae? If
clear association of normal/ordinary core-collapse SNe (SN Ib/c, and others SN
types) and GRBs would be revealed in numbers of cases, we may have strong
observational limits for gamma-ray beaming and for real energetics of the GRB
sources.",2005-05-26T13:34:44Z
"The Vertical Stellar Kinematics in Face-On Barred Galaxies: Estimating
  the Ages of Bars","In order to perform a detailed study of the stellar kinematics in the
vertical axis of bars, we obtained high signal-to-noise spectra along the major
and minor axes of the bars in a sample of 14 face-on galaxies, and used them to
determine the line of sight stellar velocity distribution, parameterized as
Gauss-Hermite series. With these data, we developed a diagnostic tool that
allows one to distinguish between recently formed and evolved bars, as well as
estimate their ages, assuming that bars form in vertically thin disks,
recognizable by low values for the vertical velocity dispersion sigma_z.
Through N-body realizations of bar unstable disk galaxies we could also check
the time scales involved in the processes which give bars an important vertical
structure. We show that sigma_z in evolved bars is roughly around 100 Km/s,
which translates to a height scale of about 1.4 Kpc, giving support to
scenarios in which bulges form through disk material. Furthermore, the bars in
our numerical simulations have values for sigma_z generally smaller than 50
Km/s even after evolving for 2 Gyr, suggesting that a slow process is
responsible for making bars as vertically thick as we observe. We verify
theoretically that the Spitzer-Schwarzschild mechanism is quantitatively able
to explain these observations if we assume that giant molecular clouds are
twice as much concentrated along the bar as in the remaining of the disk.",2005-04-28T18:15:24Z
"Gamma-Ray Bursts and the Earth: Exploration of Atmospheric, Biological,
  Climatic and Biogeochemical Effects","Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are likely to have made a number of significant
impacts on the Earth during the last billion years. We have used a
two-dimensional atmospheric model to investigate the effects on the Earth's
atmosphere of GRBs delivering a range of fluences, at various latitudes, at the
equinoxes and solstices, and at different times of day. We have estimated DNA
damage levels caused by increased solar UVB radiation, reduction in solar
visible light due to $\mathrm{NO_2}$ opacity, and deposition of nitrates
through rainout of $\mathrm{HNO_3}$. For the ``typical'' nearest burst in the
last billion years, we find globally averaged ozone depletion up to 38%.
Localized depletion reaches as much as 74%. Significant global depletion (at
least 10%) persists up to about 7 years after the burst. Our results depend
strongly on time of year and latitude over which the burst occurs. We find DNA
damage of up to 16 times the normal annual global average, well above lethal
levels for simple life forms such as phytoplankton. The greatest damage occurs
at low to mid latitudes. We find reductions in visible sunlight of a few
percent, primarily in the polar regions. Nitrate deposition similar to or
slightly greater than that currently caused by lightning is also observed,
lasting several years. We discuss how these results support the hypothesis that
the Late Ordovician mass extinction may have been initiated by a GRB.",2005-05-23T13:14:53Z
"Kinematic Structure of H2 and [Fe II] in the Bipolar Planetary Nebula M
  2-9","We present high-dispersion long-slit IR spectra of the double-shell bipolar
planetary nebula M 2-9 in the emission lines [Fe II] 16435 and H2 v=1--0 S(1)
21218. H2 spectra reveal for the first time the kinematic structure of the
outer shell in M 2-9. Kinematics of the inner shell, traced by [Fe II],
resemble those of optical lines like [N II]. [Fe II] and H2 shells have
expansion speeds roughly proportional to distance from the star (``Hubble''
flows) and share the same dynamical age of 1200--2000 yr, depending on the
distance to M 2-9. Thus, the inner ionized lobes and outer molecular lobes, as
well as the molecular torus and ``outer loops'' measured by other observers,
were all formed around the same time. Consequently, their nested structure
likely arises from an excitation gradient rather than independent ejections. H2
and [Fe II] emission is distributed more uniformly than [N II], and IR lines
are not dominated by the moving ionization pattern like visual-wavelength
lines. We suggest that this is because IR lines of [Fe II] and H2 are excited
by relatively isotropic far-UV radiation (Balmer continuum), whereas optical
lines respond to a directed rotating beam of Lyman continuum. Finally, we
highlight intriguing similarities between M 2-9 and the Homunculus of eta
Carinae, despite the different central engines powering the two nebulae.",2005-04-22T17:40:07Z
"Zn and Cr abundances in damped Lyman alpha systems from the CORALS
  survey","We present metal abundances in 15 damped Lyman alpha systems (DLAs) from the
Complete Optical and Radio Absorption Line System (CORALS) survey, designed to
be free from any biasing effects due to extinction of QSOs by dust in
intervening absorbers. It has long been suggested that such biasing may explain
differences in metallicity between DLAs and coeval luminous galaxies, and
between model predictions and observations. We use our measured zinc and
chromium abundances (combined with those for five more CORALS DLAs from the
literature, giving us a very nearly complete sample) to test whether the
metallicity and degree of dust depletion in CORALS DLAs are significantly
different from those of existing, larger, samples of DLAs drawn from magnitude
limited, optical surveys. We find that the column density weighted metallicity
of CORALS DLAs, [<(Zn/H)_DLA>] = -0.88 +/- 0.21 in the redshift interval 1.86 <
z(abs) < 3.45, is only marginally higher than that of a control sample from the
recent compilation by Kulkarni et al., [<(Zn/H)_DLA>] = -1.09 +/- 0.10. With
the present limited statistics this difference is not highly significant.
Furthermore, we find no evidence for increased dust depletions in CORALS
DLAs--their [Cr/Zn] ratios conform to the known trend of increasing depletion
(decreasing [Cr/Zn]) with increasing metallicity, and we have encountered no
cases where Cr is as depleted as in local cold interstellar clouds. These
results, when combined with the earlier findings of the CORALS survey reported
by Ellison et al. in 2001, make it difficult to invoke a dust-induced bias to
explain the generally low level of chemical evolution exhibited by most DLAs.
Rather, they indicate that large scale optical QSO surveys give a fair census
of the population of high redshift absorbers.",2005-06-08T20:00:13Z
Primordial Black Holes - Recent Developments,"Recent developments in the study of primordial black holes (PBHs) will be
reviewed, with particular emphasis on their formation and evaporation. PBHs
could provide a unique probe of the early Universe, gravitational collapse,
high energy physics and quantum gravity. Indeed their study may place
interesting constraints on the physics relevant to these areas even if they
never formed. In the ""early Universe"" context, particularly useful constraints
can be placed on inflationary scenarios, especially if evaporating PBHs leave
stable Planck-mass relicts. In the ""gravitational collapse"" context, the
existence of PBHs could provide a unique test of the sort of critical phenomena
discovered in recent numerical calculations. In the ""high energy physics""
context, information may come from gamma-ray bursts (if a subset of these are
generated by PBH explosions) or from cosmic rays (if some of these derive from
evaporating PBHs). In the ""quantum gravity"" context, the formation and
evaporation of small black holes could lead to observable signatures in cosmic
ray events and accelerator experiments, providing there are extra dimensions
and providing the quantum gravity scale is around a TeV.",2005-04-01T19:34:37Z
Late-time Inhomogeneity and Acceleration Without Dark Energy,"The inhomogeneous distribution of matter in the non-linear regime of
galaxies, clusters of galaxies and voids is described by an exact, spherically
symmetric inhomogeneous solution of Einstein's gravitational field equations,
corresponding to an under-dense void. The solution becomes the homogeneous and
isotropic Einstein-de Sitter solution for a red shift $z > 10-20$, which
describes the matter dominated CMB data with small inhomogeneities
$\delta\rho/\rho\sim 10^{-5}$. A spatial volume averaging of physical
quantities is introduced and the averaged time evolution expansion parameter
$\theta$ in the Raychoudhuri equation can give rise in the late-time universe
to a volume averaged deceleration parameter $<q>$ that is negative for a
positive matter density. This allows for a region of accelerated expansion
which does not require a negative pressure dark energy or a cosmological
constant. A negative deceleration parameter can be derived by this volume
averaging procedure from the Lema\^{i}tre-Tolman-Bondi open void solution,
which describes the late-time non-linear regime associated with galaxies and
under-dense voids and solves the ``coincidence'' problem.",2005-05-16T16:20:45Z
XMM-Newton observations of AM CVn binaries,"We present the results of XMM-Newton observations of four AM CVn systems --
AM CVn, CR Boo, HP Lib and GP Com. Their light curves show very different
characteristics. The X-ray light curves show no coherent pulsations, suggesting
the accreting white dwarfs have relatively low magnetic field strengths. Their
spectra were best modelled using a multi-temperature emission model and a
strong UV component. We find that CR Boo and HP Lib have X-ray spectra with
abundances consistent with relatively low temperature CNO processed material,
while AM CVn and GP Com show an enhancement of nitrogen. A large fraction of
the accretion luminosity is emitted in the UV. We determine accretion
luminosities of ~1.6x10^{33} ergs/s and 1.7x10^{31} ergs/s for AM CVn and GP
Com respectively. Comparing the implied mass transfer rates with that derived
using model fits to optical and UV spectra, we find evidence that in the case
of AM CVn, we do not detect a significant proportion of the accretion energy.
This missing component could be lost in the form of a wind.",2005-05-27T09:27:54Z
"Regularized orbit models unveiling the stellar structure and dark matter
  halo of the Coma elliptical NGC 4807","This is the second in a series of papers dedicated to unveil the mass
structure and orbital content of a sample of flattened early-type galaxies in
the Coma cluster. The ability of our orbit libraries to reconstruct internal
stellar motions and the mass composition of a typical elliptical in the sample
is investigated by means of Monte-Carlo simulations of isotropic rotator
models. The simulations allow a determination of the optimal amount of
regularization needed in the orbit superpositions. It is shown that under
realistic observational conditions and with the appropriate regularization
internal velocity moments can be reconstructed to an accuracy of about 15 per
cent; the same accuracy can be achieved for the circular velocity and dark
matter fraction. In contrast, the flattening of the halo remains unconstrained.
Regularized orbit superpositions are applied to a first galaxy in our sample,
NGC 4807, for which stellar kinematical observations extend to 3 Reff. The
galaxy seems dark matter dominated outside 2 Reff. Logarithmic dark matter
potentials are consistent with the data, as well as NFW-profiles, mimicking
logarithmic potentials over the observationally sampled radial range. In both
cases, the derived stellar mass-to-light ratio agrees well with independently
obtained mass-to-light ratios from stellar population analysis. Kinematically,
NGC 4807 is characterized by mild radial anisotropy outside r>0.5 Reff,
becoming isotropic towards the center. Our orbit models hint at either a
distinct stellar component or weak triaxiality in the outer parts of the
galaxy.",2005-04-21T13:26:53Z
"The Shear TEsting Programme 1: Weak lensing analysis of simulated
  ground-based observations","The Shear TEsting Programme, STEP, is a collaborative project to improve the
accuracy and reliability of all weak lensing measurements in preparation for
the next generation of wide-field surveys. In this first STEP paper we present
the results of a blind analysis of simulated ground-based observations of
relatively simple galaxy morphologies. The most successful methods are shown to
achieve percent level accuracy. From the cosmic shear pipelines that have been
used to constrain cosmology, we find weak lensing shear measured to an accuracy
that is within the statistical errors of current weak lensing analyses, with
shear measurements accurate to better than 7%. The dominant source of
measurement error is shown to arise from calibration uncertainties where the
measured shear is over or under-estimated by a constant multiplicative factor.
This is of concern as calibration errors cannot be detected through standard
diagnostic tests. The measured calibration errors appear to result from stellar
contamination, false object detection, the shear measurement method itself,
selection bias and/or the use of biased weights. Additive systematics (false
detections of shear) resulting from residual point-spread function anisotropy
are, in most cases, reduced to below an equivalent shear of 0.001, an order of
magnitude below cosmic shear distortions on the scales probed by current
surveys.
  Our results provide a snapshot view of the accuracy of current ground-based
weak lensing methods and a benchmark upon which we can improve. To this end we
provide descriptions of each method tested and include details of the eight
different implementations of the commonly used Kaiser, Squires and Broadhurst
(1995) method (KSB+) to aid the improvement of future KSB+ analyses.",2005-06-06T15:02:41Z
"Broad-band colors and overall photometric properties of template galaxy
  models from stellar population synthesis","We present here a new set of evolutionary population synthesis models for
template galaxies along the Hubble morphological sequence. The models, that
account for the individual evolution of the bulge, disk, and halo components,
provide basic morphological features, along with bolometric luminosity and
color evolution (including Johnson/Cousins ""UBVRcIcJHK"", Gunn ""gri"", and
Washington ""CMT1T2"" photometric systems) between 1 and 15 Gyr. Luminosity
contribution from residual gas is also evaluated, both in terms of nebular

Finding SZ clusters in the ACBAR maps,"We present a new method for component separation from multifrequency maps
aimed to extract Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) galaxy clusters from Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) experiments. This method is best suited to recover
non--Gaussian, spatially localized and sparse signals. We apply our method on
simulated maps of the ACBAR experiment. We find that this method improves the
reconstruction of the integrated $y$ parameter by a factor three with respect
to the Wiener filter case. Moreover, the scatter associated with the
reconstruction is reduced by 30 per cent.",2005-03-30T16:31:32Z
Fluorine Abundances in the Orion Nebula Cluster,"This study uses cool dwarfs as sources with which to probe fluorine
abundances via HF. This molecule is detected for the first time in young K-M
dwarf members of an OB association. Fluorine, oxygen, and carbon abundances
were derived from the HF(1--0) R9 line along with samples of OH and CO
vibration-rotation lines present in high-resolution infrared spectra observed
with the Phoenix spectrograph on the Gemini South Telescope. The fluorine and
oxygen results obtained for these targets, still in the pre-main-sequence stage
of evolution, agree well with the general trend defined for the Milky Way disk;
the latter being deduced from observations of more evolved giant stars. In
addition, the carbon and oxygen abundances obtained for the studied stars
overlap results from previous studies of the more massive OB stars and FG dwarf
members of the Orion Nebula Cluster. We conclude from this agreement that the
fluorine abundances derived for the Orion K-M dwarfs (when there is no
conspicuous evidence of disks) can be considered a good representation of the
current fluorine abundance value for the Milky Way disk.",2005-02-21T21:19:45Z
"Weakly Nonlocal Hydrodynamics and the Origin of Viscosity in the
  Adhesion Model","We use the weakly nonlocal hydrodynamics approach to obtain a dynamical
equation for the peculiar velocity field in which the viscosity term is
physically motivated. Based on some properties of the Ginzburg-Landau equation
and the wave mechanics analog of hydrodynamics we find the nonlocal adhesion
approximation taking into account the internal structures of the Zeldovich
pancakes. If the internal structures correspond to significant mesoscopic
fluctuations, viscosity is probably driven by a stochastic force and dynamics
is given by the noisy Burgers equation.",2005-02-28T16:05:22Z
The XMM-Newton Slew Survey,"XMM-Newton, with the huge collecting area of its mirrors and the high quantum
efficiency of its EPIC detectors, is the most sensitive X-ray observatory ever
flown. This is strikingly evident during slew exposures, which, while yielding
only at most 14 seconds of on-source exposure time, actually constitute a 2-10
keV survey ten times deeper than all other ""all-sky"" surveys. The current
(April 2005) XMM archive contains 374 slew exposures which give a uniform
coverage over around 10,000 square degrees (approx. 25% of the sky). Here we
describe the results of pilot studies, the current status of the XMM-Newton
Slew Survey, up-to-date results and our progress towards constructing a
catalogue of slew detections in the full 0.2-12 keV energy band.",2005-06-16T13:38:40Z
Speeding Up Cosmological Boltzmann Codes,"We introduce a novel strategy for cosmological Boltzmann codes leading to an
increase in speed by a factor of \sim 30 for small scale Fourier modes. We
(re-)investigate the tight coupling approximation and obtain analytic formulae
reaching up to the octupoles of photon intensity and polarization. This leads
to accurate results reaching optimal precision, while still being simple.
Damping rapid oscillations of small scale modes at later times, we simplify the
integration of cosmological perturbations. We obtain analytic expressions for
the photon density contrast and velocity as well as an estimate of the
quadrupole from after last scattering until today. These analytic formulae hold
well during re-ionization and are in fact negligible for realistic cosmological
scenarios. However, they do extend the validity of our approach to models with
very large optical depth to the last scattering surface.",2005-03-11T21:08:15Z
"The Large-Scale Electrochemistry and Possible Consequences of Deep
  Impact Mission to Tempel 1","Some consequences of hypervelocity impact onto the comet Tempel 1 nucleus are
considered under assumption that SP comets are fragments of massive icy

that underwent global explosions.",2005-05-18T14:02:44Z
"BIMA Array Detections of HCN in Comets LINEAR (C/2002 T7) and NEAT
  (C/2001 Q4)","We present interferometric detections of HCN in comets LINEAR (C/2002 T7) and
NEAT (C/2001 Q4) with the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA) Array.
With a 25.4""x20.3"" synthesized beam around Comet LINEAR and using a variable
temperature and outflow velocity (VTOV) model, we found an HCN column density
of N_T=6.4+-2.1x10^12 cm^-2, and a production rate of Q(HCN)=6.5+-2.2x10^26
s^-1, giving a production rate ratio of HCN relative to H_2O of ~3.3+-1.1x10^-3
and relative to CN of ~4.6+-1.5. With a 21.3""x17.5"" synthesized beam around
Comet NEAT and using a VTOV model, we found an HCN column density of
N_T=8.5+-4.5x10^11 cm^-2, and a production rate of Q(HCN)=8.9+-4.7x10^25 s^-1,
giving a production rate ratio of HCN relative to H_2O of ~7.4+-3.9x10^-4 and
relative to CN of ~0.3+-0.2. For both comets, the production rates relative to
H_2O are similar to those found in previous comet observations. For Comet
LINEAR the production rate relative to CN is consistent with HCN being the
primary parent species of CN, while for Comet NEAT it is too low for this to be
the case.",2005-05-24T20:29:16Z
Sulphur abundances in Terzan 7,"We present here the first measurements of sulphur abundances in extragalactic
stars. We make use of high resolution spectra, obtained with UVES at the ESO
8.2 m Kueyen telescope, of three giants of the Globular Cluster Terzan 7, which
belongs to the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. We measure the sulphur abundances
using the lines of S I multiplet 1. The S/Fe ratios for all three stars are
nearly solar, thus considerably lower than what is found in Galactic stars of
comparable iron content ([Fe/H] ~ -0.50). This finding is in keeping with the
abundances of other alpha-chain elements in this cluster and in Sagittarius and
other dSphs in general. These low alpha-chain elements to iron ratios suggest
that Sagittarius and its Globular Clusters have experienced a low or bursting
star-formation rate. Our sulphur abundances imply <\log (S/O)> = -1.61 which is
comparable to what is found in many H II regions of similar oxygen content, and
is slightly lower than the solar value (log (S/O)sun = -1.51). These are also
the first measurements of sulphur abundances in a Globular Cluster, thus a
direct comparison of Terzan 7 and Galactic Globular Clusters is not possible
yet. However our analysis suggests that the lines of S I multiplet 1 should be
measurable for other Globular Clusters at least down to a metallicity ~ -1.5.",2005-04-21T09:17:44Z
The Blast Energy Efficiency of GRBs,"Using data mostly assembled by previous authors, we consider the linear
correlation between the apparent radiative efficiency $\epsilon_{\gamma}$
(defined as the ratio of isotropic equivalent radiative output to inferred
isotropic equivalent kinetic energy of the blast) and $E_{peak}^{\alpha}$ where
$1.4<\alpha<2$, for 17 of 22 GRBs (Lloyd-Ronning and Zhang, 2004). We note in a
quantitative manner that this is consistent with the hypothesis that
$\epsilon_{\gamma}$ and $E_{peak}$ are influenced by viewing angle. We suggest
a more general theoretically derived expression for this correlation that could
be tested with a richer data set. If the reduction in both $\epsilon_{\gamma}$
and $E_{peak}$ is due to viewing angle effects, then the actual radiative
efficiency is $\sim 7$. We also find preliminary evidence (with a small sample)
for a separate class of weak GRB afterglows.",2005-03-24T14:28:49Z
Intracluster stars in the Virgo cluster core,"We have investigated the properties of the diffuse light in the Virgo cluster
core region, based on the detection of intracluster planetary nebulae (PNe) in
four fields. We eliminate the bias from misclassified faint continuum objects,
using improved Monte Carlo simulations, and the contaminations by high redshift
Ly$\alpha$ galaxies, using the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity function in blank fields.
Recent spectroscopic observations confirm that our photometric PN samples are
well-understood. We find that the diffuse stellar population in the Virgo core
region is inhomogeneous on scales of 30'-90': there exist significant
field-to-field variations in the number density of PNe and the inferred amount
of intracluster light, with some empty fields, some fields dominated by
extended Virgo galaxy halos, and some fields dominated by the true intracluster
component. There is no clear trend with distance from M87. The mean surface
luminosity density, its rms variation, and the mean surface brightness of
diffuse light in our 4 fields are $\Sigma_B = 2.7 x 10^{6}$ L$_{B\odot}$
arcmin$^{-2}$, ${rms} = 2.1 \times 10^{6}$ L$_{B\odot}$ arcmin$^{-2}$, and
$\bar{\mu}_{B}=29.0$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ respectively. Our results indicate that
the Virgo cluster is a dynamically young environment, and that the intracluster
component is associated at least partially with local physical processes like
galaxy interactions or harassment. We also argue, based on kinematic evidence,
that the so-called 'over-luminous' PNe in the halo of M84 are dynamically
associated with this galaxy, and must thus be brighter than and part of a
different stellar population from the normal PN population in elliptical
galaxies.",2005-02-21T16:32:29Z
"High Mass Star Formation I: The Mass Distribution of Submillimeter
  Clumps in NGC 7538","We present submillimeter continuum maps at 450 and 850 microns of a 12 x 8
arcminute region of the NGC 7538 high-mass star-forming region, made using the
Submillimeter Common-User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) on the James Clerk Maxwell
Telescope. We used an automated clump-finding algorithm to identify 67 clumps
in the 450 micron image and 77 in the 850 micron image. Contrary to previous
studies, we find a positive correlation between high spectral index, alpha, and
high submillimeter flux, with the difference being accounted for by different
treatments of the error beam. We interpret the higher spectral index at
submillimeter peaks as a reflection of elevated dust temperature, particularly
when there is an embedded infrared source, though it may also reflect changing
dust properties. The clump mass-radius relationship is well-fit by a power law
of the form M \propto R^(-x) with x = 1.5-2.1, consistent with theories of
turbulently-supported clumps. According to our most reliable analysis, the
high-mass end (approx. 100-2700 M_sun) of the submillimeter clump mass function
in NGC 7538 follows a Salpeter-like power law with index 2.0 +/- 0.3. This
result agrees well with similar studies of lower-mass regions rho Oph and Orion
B. We interpret the apparent invariance of the shape of the clump mass function
over a broad range of parent cloud masses as evidence for the self-similarity
of the physical processes which determine it. This result is consistent with
models which suggest that turbulent fragmentation, acting at early times, is
sufficient to set the clump mass function.",2005-03-08T17:24:04Z
"Upper limit on the photon fraction in highest-energy cosmic rays from
  AGASA data","A new method to derive an upper limit on photon primaries from small data
sets of air showers is developed which accounts for shower properties varying
with the primary energy and arrival direction. Applying this method to the
highest-energy showers recorded by the AGASA experiment, an upper limit on the
photon fraction of 51% (67%) at a confidence level of 90% (95%) for primary
energies above 1.25 * 10^20 eV is set. This new limit on the photon fraction
above the GZK cutoff energy constrains the Z-burst model of the origin of
highest-energy cosmic rays.",2005-02-21T16:11:08Z
Normal Gas-Rich Galaxies in the Far-Infrared: The Legacy of ISOPHOT,"Following on from IRAS, the ISOPHOT instrument on board the Infrared Space
Observatory (ISO) has provided a huge advancement in our knowledge of the
phenomenology of the far-infrared (FIR) emission of normal galaxies and the
underlying physical processes. Highlights include: the discovery of an extended
cold dust emission component, present in all types of gas-rich galaxies and
carrying the bulk of the dust luminosity; the definitive characterisation of
the spectral energy distribution in the FIR, revealing the channels through
which stars power the FIR light; the derivation of realistic geometries for
stars and dust from ISOPHOT imaging and the discovery of cold dust associated
with HI extending beyond the optical body of galaxies.",2005-02-09T10:54:29Z
An Atlas of Warm AGN and Starbursts from the IRAS Deep Fields,"We present 180 AGN candidates based on color selection from the IRAS
slow-scan deep observations, with color criteria broadened from the initial
Point-Source Catalog samples to include similar objects with redshifts up to
z=1 and allowing for two-band detections. Spectroscopic identifications have
been obtained for 80 (44%); some additional ones are secure based on radio
detections or optical morphology, although yet unobserved spectroscopically.
These spectroscopic identifications include 13 Sy 1 galaxies, 17 Sy 2 Seyferts,
29 starbursts, 7 LINER systems, and 13 emission-line galaxies so heavily
reddened as to remain of ambiguous classification. The optical magnitudes range
from R=12.0-20.5; counts suggest that incompleteness is important fainter than
R=15.5. Redshifts extend to z=0.51, with a significant part of the sample at
z>0.2. The sample includes slightly more AGN than star-forming systems among
those where the spectra contain enough diagnostic feature to make the
distinction. The active nuclei include several broad-line objects with strong
Fe II emission, and composite objects with the absorption-line signatures of
fading starbursts. These AGN with warm far-IR colors have little overlap with
the ""red AGN"" identified with 2MASS; only a single Sy 1 was detected by 2MASS
with J-K > 2. Some reliable IRAS detections have either very faint optical
counterparts or only absorption-line galaxies, potentially being deeply
obscured AGN. The IRAS detections include a newly identified symbiotic star,
and several possible examples of the ""Vega phenomenon"", including dwarfs as
cool as type K. Appendices detail these candidate stars, and the
optical-identification content of a particularly deep set of high-latitude IRAS
scans (probing the limits of optical identification from IRAS data alone).",2005-03-03T15:25:54Z
XTE J1550-564: INTEGRAL Observations of a Failed Outburst,"The well known black-hole X-ray binary transient XTE J1550-564 underwent an
outburst during the spring of 2003 which was substantially underluminous in
comparison to previous periods of peak activity in that source. In addition,
our analysis shows that it apparently remained in the hard spectral state over
the duration of that outburst. This is again in sharp contrast to major
outbursts of that source in 1998/1999 during which it exhibited an irregular
light curve, multiple state changes and collimated outflows. This leads us to
classify it as a ""failed outburst."" We present the results of our study of the
spring 2003 event including light curves based on observations from both
INTEGRAL and RXTE. In addition, we studied the evolution of the high-energy
3-300 keV continuum spectrum using data obtained with three main instruments on
INTEGRAL. These spectra are consistent with typical low-hard-state thermal
Comptonization emission. We also consider the 2003 event in the context of a
multi-source, multi-event period-peak luminosity diagram in which it is a clear
outlyer. We then consider the possibility that the 2003 event was due to a
discrete accretion event rather than a limit-cycle instablility. In that
context, we apply model fitting to derive the timescale for viscous propagation
in the disk, and infer some physical characteristics.",2005-02-23T21:48:22Z
"The Reionization History and Early Metal Enrichment inferred from the
  Gamma-Ray Burst Rate","Based on the gamma-ray burst (GRB) event rate at redshifts of $4 \leq z \leq
12$, which is assessed by the spectral peak energy-to-luminosity relation
recently found by Yonetoku et al., we observationally derive the star formation
rate (SFR) for Pop III stars in a high redshift universe. As a result, we find
that Pop III stars could form continuously at $4 \leq z \leq 12$. Using the
derived Pop III SFR, we attempt to estimate the ultraviolet (UV) photon
emission rate at $7 \leq z \leq 12$ in which redshift range no observational
information has been hitherto obtained on ionizing radiation intensity. We find
that the UV emissivity at $7 \leq z \leq 12$ can make a noticeable contribution
to the early reionization. The maximal emissivity is higher than the level
required to keep ionizing the intergalactic matter at $7 \leq z \leq 12$.
However, if the escape fraction of ionizing photons from Pop III objects is
smaller than 10%, then the IGM can be neutralized at some redshift, which may
lead to the double reionization. As for the enrichment, the ejection of all
metals synthesized in Pop III objects is marginally consistent with the IGM
metallicity, although the confinement of metals in Pop III objects can reduce
the enrichment significantly.",2005-04-15T12:49:49Z
"Study of molecular layers in the atmosphere of the supergiant star mu
  Cep by interferometry in the K band","Infrared interferometry of supergiant and Mira stars has recently been
reinterpreted as revealing the presence of deep molecular layers. Empirical
models for a photosphere surrounded by a simple molecular layer or envelope
have led to a consistent interpretation of previously inconsistent data. The
stellar photospheres are found to be smaller than previously understood, and
the molecular layer is much higher and denser than predicted by hydrostatic
equilibrium. However, the analysis was based on spatial observations with
medium-band optical filters, which mixed the visibilities of different spatial
structures. This paper reports spatial interferometry with narrow spectral
bands, isolating near-continuum and strong molecular features, obtained for the
supergiant mu Cep. The measurements confirm strong variation of apparent
diameter across the K-band. A layer model shows that a stellar photosphere of
angular diameter 14.11+/-0.60 mas is surrounded by a molecular layer of
diameter 18.56+/-0.26 mas, with an optical thickness varying from nearly zero
at 2.15 microns to >1 at 2.39 microns. Although mu Cep and alpha Ori have a
similar spectral type, interferometry shows that they differ in their radiative
properties. Comparison with previous broad-band measurements shows the
importance of narrow spectral bands. The molecular layer or envelope appears to
be a common feature of cool supergiants.",2005-02-21T15:43:43Z
"INTEGRAL observations of OAO 1657-415: gamma-ray tomography of a B
  supergiant","OAO 1657-415 is an accreting pulsar in an eclipsing binary system. We
analyzed the INTEGRAL core program observations of this object and obtained the
eclipse light curve in the soft gamma-ray band between 15 and 40 keV. We note
that the gamma rays from the pulsar allow to probe the density profile of the
outer layers of the B supergiant companion. We find that the density profile of
the outer layer can be described by a power law with the index
  $\alpha = 8.5$. We also note that the fit hints toward smaller inclinations
of the system within the allowed range 60-90 degrees.",2005-03-14T12:19:38Z
"The HST/ACS Grism Parallel Survey: II. First Results and a Catalog of
  Faint Emission-Line Galaxies at z < 1.6","We present the first results from the HST/ACS Grism Parallel Survey, a large
program obtaining deep, slitless ACS grism spectroscopy of high-latitude HST
parallel fields. We report on 11 high Galactic latitude fields here, each with
grism integration times >12 ks. We identify 601 compact emission line galaxies
at z < 1.6, reaching emission lines to a flux limit of > 5 E-18 ergs/cm^2/s (3
sigma). We determine redshifts by cross correlation of the target spectra with
template spectra, followed by visual inspection. We measure star formation
rates from the observed [OII] 3727, [OIII] 5007 and Halpha line fluxes.
Follow-up observations with the Keck telescope of one of the survey fields
confirms our classification and redshifts with sigma(z)~0.02. This is one of
the deepest emission line surveys to date, covering a total area of 121
arcmin^2. The rough estimate of the co-moving number density of emission-line
galaxies in our survey at 0.3 < z < 1.3 is ~4.5 E-3 h^{-3}_70 Mpc^{-3}. We
reach deeper into the emission-line luminosity function than either the STIS or
NICMOS grism parallel surveys, finding an apparent space density of emission
line galaxies several times higher than those surveys. Because of the ACS high
spatial resolution, our survey is very sensitive to faint, compact galaxies
with strong emission lines and weak continua. The ACS grism survey provides the
co-moving star formation density at z < 1.6 at a high level of completeness.",2005-03-28T16:23:26Z
"VLBA Imaging Polarimetry of Active Galactic Nuclei - An Automated
  Approach","We present full polarization Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at
5 GHz and 15 GHz of 24 compact active galactic nuclei (AGN). These sources were
observed as part of a pilot project to demonstrate the feasibility of
conducting a large VLBI survey to further our understanding of the physical
properties and temporal evolution of AGN jets. The sample is drawn from the
Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS) where it overlaps with the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey at declinations north of 15 degrees. There are 2100 CLASS sources
brighter than 50 mJy at 8.4 GHz, of which we have chosen 24 for this pilot
study. All 24 sources were detected and imaged at 5 GHz with a typical dynamic
range of 500:1, and 21 of 24 sources were detected and imaged at 15 GHz. Linear
polarization was detected in 8 sources at both 5 and 15 GHz, allowing for the
creation of Faraday rotation measure (RM) images. The core RMs for the sample
were found to have an average absolute value of 390 +/- 100 rad/m^2. We also
present the discovery of a new Compact Symmetric Object, J08553+5751. All data
were processed automatically using pipelines created or adapted for the survey.",2005-03-10T07:11:40Z
Polarization of 21cm Radiation from the Epoch of Reionization,"We consider the polarization of 21cm line radiation from the epoch of
reionization due to both intrinsically polarized emission and secondary
mechanisms. We argue that Thomson scattering of the 21cm quadrupole by the
reionized universe is likely to produce the largest effect. The 21cm quadrupole
is sourced by baryonic density fluctuations and the fluctuations in the
ionization fraction due to discrete \ion{H}{2} regions. Since Thomson
scattering produces only E-type polarization and is achromatic, its unique
fingerprint can in principle be separated from foregrounds associated with
polarized synchrotron emission which should not be correlated with the cosmic
signal. We estimate that Poisson fluctuations of \ion{H}{2} regions at the end
of reionization ($z_R \sim 6$--20) produce a brightness
temperature-polarization cross-correlation signal of $\sim 0.1 - 0.3 {mK}$ on
angular scales of tens of arcminutes. This cross-correlation signal is within
the instrument sensitivities of the future {\it Square Kilometer Array} (SKA)
and close to the sensitivities of the forthcoming {\it Mileura Widefield Array}
(MWA) and {\it Low Frequency Array} (LOFAR).",2005-05-17T20:04:02Z
"Mitigation of Pulsed Interference to Redshifted HI and OH Observations
  between 960 and 1215 MHz","The neutral hydrogen 21-cm spectral line (1420.4 MHz) and the four 18-cm
lines of the hydroxyl molecule (1612-1720 MHz) are observable at redshifts
which put their measured line frequencies well below their protected frequency
bands. Part of the redshift ranges (z = 0.171-0.477 for HI and z = 0.37-0.73
for OH) fall in the 960 to 1215 MHz band that is allocated to aircraft
navigation. Most of the signals in this band are pulsed emissions of low duty
cycle so much of the time between pulses is interference free. This paper
outlines the structure and measured properties of signals in this band and
demonstrates a signal processing strategy that is effective at removing the
pulsed signals from spectra at sensitivities produced by several hours of
integration.",2005-02-04T19:46:52Z
Are There Local Analogs of Lyman Break Galaxies?,"To make direct comparisons in the rest-far-ultraviolet between LBGs at z~3
and more local star-forming galaxies, we use HST/STIS to image a set of 12
nearby (z<0.05) HII galaxies in the FUV and a set of 14 luminous compact blue
galaxies (LCBGs) at moderate redshift (z~0.5) in the NUV, corresponding to the
rest-FUV. We then subject both sets of galaxy images and those of LBGs at z~3
to the same morphological and structural analysis. We find many qualitative and
quantitative similarities between the rest-FUV characteristics of distant LBGs
and of the more nearby starburst samples, including general morphologies,
sizes, asymmetries, and concentrations. Along with some kinematic similarities,
this implies that nearby HII galaxies and LCBGs may be reasonable local analogs
of distant Lyman break galaxies.",2005-02-14T19:57:10Z
Long-term variations in the pulse emission from PSR J0737-3039B,"Analysis of 20 months of observations at the Parkes radio telescope shows
secular changes in the pulsed emission from J0737-3039B, the 2.77 s pulsar of
the double-pulsar system. Pulse profiles are becoming single-peaked in both
bright phases of the orbital modulation although there is no clear variation in
overall pulse width. The shape of the orbital modulation is also varying
systematically, with both bright phases shrinking in longitude by ~ 7 deg/yr.
However, the combined span of the two bright phases is relatively constant and
together they are shifting to higher longitudes at a rate of ~ 3 deg/yr. We
discuss the possible contributions of geodetic precession and periastron
advance to the observed variations.",2005-02-24T16:08:39Z
"The effect of long range gravitational perturbations on the first
  acoustic peak of the cosmic microwave background","In the standard cosmological model, the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic
microwave background is interpreted as variation in the gravitational potential
at the point of emission, due to the emitter being embedded in a region ${\cal
C}$ of over- or under-density spanning the length (or size) scale $\lambda$ on
which the anisotropy is measured. If the Universe is inhomogeneous, however,
similar density contrasts of size $\lambda$ are also located everywhere
surrounding ${\cal C}$. Since they are superposition states of many independent
Fourier modes with no preferred direction, such primordial clumps and voids
should not be configured according to some prescribed spatial pattern. Rather,
they can randomly trade spaces with each other while preserving the
Harrison-Zeldovich character of the matter spectrum. The outcome is an {\it
extra} perturbation of the potential when averaged over length $\lambda$ at the
emitter, and consequently an additional anisotropy on the same scale, which has
apparently been overlooked. Unlike the conventional application of the
Sachs-Wolfe effect to the WMAP observations, this extra effect is {\it not}
scale independent over the $P(k) \sim k$ part of the matter spectrum, but
increases towards smaller lengths, as $\sqrt{k}$. The consequence is a
substantial revision of the currently advertised values of the key cosmological
parameters, {\it unless} one postulates a more rapid decrease in the
gravitational force with distance than that given by the inverse-square law.",2005-02-21T20:15:39Z
Third Order Effect of Rotation on Stellar Oscillations of a B Star,"The present paper aims at investigating the effect of rotation up to third
order in the angular velocity of a star on p and g modes, based on the
formalism developed by Soufi et al. (1998). Our ultimate goal is the study of
oscillations of $\beta$ Cephei stars which are often rapidly rotating stars.
Our study shows that the third-order perturbation formalism presented by Soufi
et al. (1998) must be corrected for some missing terms and some misprints in
the equations. As a first step in our study of $\beta$ Cephei stars, we
quantify by numerical calculations the effect of rotation on the oscillation
frequencies of a uniformly rotating zero-age main-sequence star with
12~$M_\odot$. For an equatorial velocity of 100~$\rm km \, s^{-1}$, it is found
that the second- and third-order corrections for $(l,m)=(2,2)$, for instance,
are of order of 0.01$\%$ of the frequency for radial order $n=6$ and reaches up
to 0.5$\%$ for $n=14$.",2005-02-09T16:23:53Z
"Halpha-Derived Star-Formation Rates For Three z ~ 0.75 EDisCS Galaxy
  Clusters","We present Halpha-derived star-formation rates (SFRs) for three z ~ 0.75
galaxy clusters. Our 1 sigma flux limit corresponds to a star-formation rate of
0.10-0.24 solar mass per year, and our minimum reliable Halpha + [N II]
rest-frame equivalent width is 10\AA. We show that Halpha narrowband imaging is
an efficient method for measuring star formation in distant clusters. In two
out of three clusters, we find that the fraction of star-forming galaxies
increases with projected distance from the cluster center. We also find that
the fraction of star-forming galaxies decreases with increasing local galaxy
surface density in the same two clusters. We compare the median rate of star
formation among star-forming cluster galaxies to a small sample of star-forming
field galaxies from the literature and find that the median cluster SFRs are
\~50% less than the median field SFR. We characterize cluster evolution in
terms of the mass-normalized integrated cluster SFR and find that the z ~ 0.75
clusters have more SFR per cluster mass on average than the z <= 0.4 clusters
from the literature. The interpretation of this result is complicated by the
dependence of the mass-normalized SFR on cluster mass and the lack of
sufficient overlap in the mass ranges covered by the low and high redshift
samples. We find that the fraction and luminosities of the brightest starburst
galaxies at z ~ 0.75 are consistent with their being progenitors of the
post-starburst galaxies at z ~ 0.45 if the post-starburst phase lasts several
(~5) times longer than the starburst phase.",2005-04-26T18:26:56Z
Internal dynamics of the z sim 0.8 cluster RX J0152.7-1357,"We present the results from the dynamical analysis of the cluster of galaxies
RX J0152-1357, which shows a complex structure in its X-ray emission, with two
major clumps in the central region, and a third clump in the Eastern region.
Our analysis is based on redshift data for 187 galaxies. We compute the
line-of-sight velocity dispersion of galaxies, sigma_V=1322^+74_-68 kms^-1,
which is significantly larger than what is expected in the case of a relaxed
cluster with an observed X-ray temperature of 5-6 keV. We find evidence that
this cluster is far from dynamical equilibrium, as shown by the non Gaussianity
of the velocity distribution, the presence of a velocity gradient and
significant substructure. Our analysis shows that the high value of sigma_V is
due to the complex structure of RX J0152-1357, i.e. to the presence of three
galaxy clumps of different mean velocity. Using optical data we detect a
low-velocity clump (with sigma_V=300-500 kms^-1) in the central SW region and a
high--velocity clump (with sigma_V sim 700 kms^-1) in the E region, well
corresponding to the SW and E peaks detected in the X-ray emission. The central
NE X-ray peak is associated to the main galaxy structure with a velocity which
is intermediate between those of the other two clumps and sigma_V sim 900
kms^-1. The mass of the whole system within 2 Mpc is estimated to lie in the
range (1.2-2.2)X10^{15} M_sun. Analytic calculations based on the two-body
model indicate that the system is most likely bound, currently undergoing
merging. In particular, we suggest that the SW clump is not a small group, but
rather the dense cluster-core of a massive cluster.",2005-06-09T16:49:06Z
Cosmic ray threshold in an asymptotically dS spacetime,"We discuss the threshold anomaly in ultra-high energy cosmic ray physics by
assuming that the matter world just be perturbation of a de Sitter universe,
which is consistent with the recent astronomical observations: about two thirds
of the whole energy in the universe is contributed by a small positive
cosmological constant. One-particle states are presented explicitly. It is
noticed that the dispersion relation of free particles is dependent on the
degrees of freedom of angular momentum. This fact can be regarded as the
effects of the cosmological constant on kinematics of particles.",2005-05-31T08:46:57Z
The Nature of Dark Matter,"The observed strong dark-to-luminous matter coupling suggests the existence
of a some functional relation between visible and DM sources which leads to
biased Einstein equations. We show that such a bias appears in the case when
the topological structure of the actual Universe at very large distances does
not match properly that of the Friedman space. We introduce a bias operator
$\rho_{DM} = B \rho_{vis}$ and show that the simple bias function $b \~1/r^{2}$
(the kernel of $B$) allows to account for all the variety of observed DM halos
in astrophysical systems. In galaxies such a bias forms the cored DM
distribution with the radius $R_{C}\sim R_{opt}$ (which explains the recently
observed strong correlation between $R_{C}$ and $R_{opt}$), while for a point
source it produces the logarithmic correction to the Newton's potential (which
explains the observed flat rotation curves in spirals). Finally, we show that
in the theory suggested the galaxy formation process leads to a specific
variation with time of all interaction constants and, in particular, of the
fine structure constant.",2005-05-06T17:37:36Z
"The Monopole Moment of the Three-Point Correlation Function of the
  2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey","We measure the monopole moment of the three-point correlation function on
scales $1\mpc-70\mpc$ in the Two degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS).
Volume limited samples are constructed using a series of integral magnitudes
bins between $M = -18 ... -22$. Our measurements with a novel edge-corrected
estimator represent most, if not all, three-point level monopole or angular
averaged information in the catalogue. We fit a perturbative non-linear bias
model to a joint data vector formed from the estimated two- and three-point
correlation functions. Two different models are used: an analytic model based
on Eulerian perturbation theory including bias and redshift distortions, and a
phenomenological bias model based on the direct redshift space measurements in
the large Virgo simulations. To interpret the clustering results, we perform a
three parameter Gaussian maximum likelihood analysis. In the canonical $-21
\sim -20$ volume limited sample we find $\sigma_8 = 0.93^{+0.06}_{-0.2}$, $b =
1.04^{+0.23}_{-0.09}$, and $b_2 = -0.06^{+0.003}_{-0.001}$. Our estimate of
$\sigma_8$, is robust across the different volume limited samples constructed.
These results, based solely on the large scale clustering of galaxies, are in
excellent agreement with previous analyses using the Wilkinson Anisotropy
Probe: this is a spectacular success of the concordance model. We also present
two-parameter fits for the bias parameters, which are in excellent agreement
with previous findings of the bias evolution in the 2dFGRS.",2005-05-19T21:00:46Z
IMF biases and how to correct them,"We discuss possible sources of biases in the determination of the initial
mass function (IMF) introduced by the binning of the data, the uncertainty in
the determinations of masses, and the existence of unresolved multiple systems.
Those three effects tend to produce IMFs that are flatter than the real one. We
analyze the importance of each effect and suggest techniques that minimize or
eliminate the biases. We also report the detection of the first astrometric
binary system composed of two very-early O-type stars, HD 93129 A.",2005-06-13T18:05:45Z
The value of density measurements in stellar coronae,"The grating instruments on board Chandra and XMM-Newton now allow
measurements of electron densities. These rely on the ratios of fluxes in
emission lines, where one line depends on both collisional and radiative decay
rates. The electron density is required to constrain the physical extent of the
emitting region, and large samples of measurements are of interest in the
context of trends in coronal activity. Here we discuss the important He {\sc
i}-like ions and the differences in densities that result when different
current data bases are used.",2005-04-06T12:09:26Z
The cosmic shear three-point functions,"We investigate the three-point functions of the weak lensing cosmic shear,
using both analytic methods and numerical results from N-body simulations. The
analytic model, an isolated dark matter halo with a powerlaw profile chosen to
fit the effective index at the scale probed, can be used to understand the
basic properties of the eight three-point functions observed in simulations. We
use this model to construct a single three-point function estimator that
""optimally"" combines the eight three-point functions. This new estimator is an
alternative to Map statistics and provides up to a factor of two improvement in
signal to noise compared to previously used combinations of cosmic shear
three-point functions.",2005-05-13T15:43:49Z
Realistic arrival time distribution from an isotropic light source,"The event reconstruction in high energy neutrino telescopes is based on the
expression of the time delay distribution of the detected photons propagating
to some distance from their emission point through a uniform and scattering
medium.
  Considering a realistic detector with a finite time resolution, we derive an
expression for the probability density function of the time delay of detected
photons. The asymptotic properties of this function as well as its
corresponding cumulative probability distribution are calculated and discussed.",2005-06-07T09:19:47Z
"The Angstrom Project: a microlensing survey of the structure and
  composition of the bulge of the Andromeda galaxy","The Andromeda Galaxy Stellar Robotic Microlensing Project (The Angstrom
Project) aims to use stellar microlensing events to trace the structure and
composition of the inner regions of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). We present
microlensing rate and timescale predictions and spatial distributions for
stellar and sub-stellar lens populations in combined disk and barred bulge
models of M31. We show that at least half of the stellar microlenses in and
around the bulge are expected to have characteristic durations between 1 and 10
days, rising to as much as 80% for brown-dwarf dominated mass functions. These
short-duration events are mostly missed by current microlensing surveys that
are looking for Macho candidates in the M31 dark matter halo. Our models
predict that an intensive monitoring survey programme such as Angstrom, which
will be able to detect events of durations upwards of a day, could detect
around 30 events per season within ~5 arcminutes of the M31 centre, due to
ordinary low-mass stars and remnants. This yield increases to more than 60
events for brown-dwarf dominated mass functions. The overall number of events
and their average duration are sensitive diagnostics of the bulge mass, in
particular the contribution of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. The combination
of an inclined disk, an offset bar-like bulge, and differences in the bulge and
disk luminosity functions results in a four-way asymmetry in the number of
events expected in each quadrant defined by the M31 disk axes. The asymmetry is
sensitive to the bar prolongation, orientation and mass.",2005-02-25T20:55:45Z
Reduction Algorithms for the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer,"We describe the data reduction algorithms for the Multiband Imaging
Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) instrument. These algorithms were based on
extensive preflight testing and modeling of the Si:As (24 micron) and Ge:Ga (70
and 160 micron) arrays in MIPS and have been refined based on initial flight
data. The behaviors we describe are typical of state-of-the-art infrared focal
planes operated in the low backgrounds of space. The Ge arrays are bulk
photoconductors and therefore show a variety of artifacts that must be removed
to calibrate the data. The Si array, while better behaved than the Ge arrays,
does show a handful of artifacts that also must be removed to calibrate the
data. The data reduction to remove these effects is divided into three parts.
The first part converts the non-destructively read data ramps into slopes while
removing artifacts with time constants of the order of the exposure time. The
second part calibrates the slope measurements while removing artifacts with
time constants longer than the exposure time. The third part uses the
redundancy inherit in the MIPS observing modes to improve the artifact removal
iteratively. For each of these steps, we illustrate the relevant laboratory
experiments or theoretical arguments along with the mathematical approaches
taken to calibrate the data. Finally, we describe how these preflight
algorithms have performed on actual flight data.",2005-02-03T20:21:17Z
High-Energy pulse profile of the Transient X-ray Pulsar SAX J2103.5+4545,"In two recent INTEGRAL papers, Lutovinov et al. (2003) and Blay et al. (2004)
report a timing and spectral analysis of the transient Be/X-ray pulsar SAX
J2103.5+4545 at high energies (5--200 keV). In this work we present for the
first time a study of the pulse profile at energies above 20 keV using INTEGRAL
data. The spin-pulse profile shows a prominent (with a duty cycle of 14%) and
broad (with a FWHM of ~ 51 s) peak and a secondary peak which becomes more
evident above 20 keV. The pulsed fraction increases with energy from ~ 45% at
5--40 keV to ~ 80% at 40--80 keV. The morphology of the pulse profile also
changes as a function of energy, consistent with variations in the spectral
components that are visible in the pulse phase resolved spectra. A study of the
double peaked profile shows that the difference in the two peaks can be modeled
by a different scattering fraction between the radiation from the two magnetic
poles.",2005-03-01T11:22:17Z
"Can black hole MACHO binaries be detected by the Brazilian spherical
  antenna?","Different studies show that dark matter of non-baryonic origin might exist.
There have been experimental evidences that at least one form of dark matter
has been detected through microlensing effects. This form of dark matter is
named MACHOs (Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects). The MACHO
collaboration estimated that the masses of these objects are to be in the range
0.15-0.95 solar masses, where the most probable mass is of 0.5 solar masses.
Some authors argue that MACHOs could be black holes, and that they could form
binary systems, BHMACHO binaries. As is well known binary systems are sources
of gravitational waves. The Brazilian spherical antenna will operate in the
frequency band of 3.0-3.4 kHz, sensitive to binaries of a pair of 0.5 solar
mass black holes just before coalescing. In the present work we study the
detectability of these putative BHMACHO binaries by the Brazilian spherical
antenna Mario Schenberg.",2005-03-04T19:56:58Z
Weak lensing analysis in three dimensions,"We present a comprehensive full-sky 3-dimensional analysis of the
weak-lensing fields and their corresponding power spectra. Using the formalism
of spin-weight spherical harmonics and spherical Bessel functions, we relate
the two-point statistics of the harmonic expansion coefficients of the weak
lensing shear and convergence to the power spectrum of the matter density
perturbations, and derive small-angle limits. Such a study is relevant in view
of the next generation of large-scale weak lensing surveys which will provide
distance information about the sources through photometric redshifts. This
opens up the possibility of accurate cosmological parameter estimation via weak
lensing, with an emphasis on the equation of state of dark energy.",2005-03-22T16:54:53Z
Constraints on backreaction in dust universes,"We study backreaction in dust universes using exact equations which do not
rely on perturbation theory, concentrating on theoretical and observational
constraints. In particular, we discuss the recent suggestion (in
hep-th/0503117) that superhorizon perturbations could explain present-day
accelerated expansion as a useful example which can be ruled out. We note that
a backreaction explanation of late-time acceleration will have to involve
spatial curvature and subhorizon perturbations.",2005-04-01T20:37:04Z
"The First Detailed Abundances for M giants in Baade's Window from
  Infrared Spectroscopy","We report the first abundance analysis of 14 M giant stars in the Galactic
bulge, based on R=25,000 infrared spectroscopy (1.5-1.8um) using NIRSPEC at the
Keck II telescope. Because some of the bulge M giants reach high luminosities
and have very late spectral type, it has been suggested that they are the
progeny of only the most metal rich bulge stars, or possibly members of a
younger bulge population. We find the iron abundance and composition of the M
giants are similar to those of the K giants that have abundances determined
from optical high resolution spectroscopy: <[Fe/H]>=-0.190 +/- 0.020 with a
1-sigma dispersion of 0.08 +/- 0.015. Comparing our bulge M giants to a control
sample of local disk M giants in the Solar vicinity, we find the bulge stars
are enhanced in alpha elements at the level of +0.3 dex relative to the Solar
composition stars, consistent with other studies of bulge globular clusters and
field stars. This small sample shows no dependence of spectral type on
metallicity, nor is there any indication that the M giants are the evolved
members of a subset of the bulge population endowed with special
characteristics such as relative youth or high metallicity. We also find low
12C/13C < 10, confirming the prsence of extra-mixing processes during the red
gaint phase of evolution",2005-06-02T09:37:39Z
Constraints on the sound speed of dark energy,"We have studied constraints on the equation of state, $w$, and speed of
sound, c_s, of the dark energy from a joint analysis of data from the cosmic
microwave background, large scale structure and type-Ia supernovae. We find
that current observations have no significant sensitivity to c_s. However,
there is a slight difference between models in which there are no dark energy
perturbations and models in which dark energy behaves as a fluid. Assuming that
there are no dark energy perturbations shifts the allowed region for $w$ to
slightly higher values. At present models with and without dark energy
perturbations provide roughly equally good fits to observations, but the
difference is potentially important for future parameter estimations. Finally,
we have also performed error forecasts for future measurements of c_s.",2005-04-01T09:05:42Z
Envelope models for the supersoft X-ray emission of V1974 Cyg,"The evolution of the soft X-ray emission of V1974 Cyg has been simulated by a
white dwarf envelope model with steady hydrogen burning. The comparison of the
results obtained from ROSAT observations with the results of our envelope
models indicates that the post-outburst evolution of the nova can be explained
by steady H-burning on either a 0.9 Msun white dwarf with 50% degree of mixing
between solar-like accreted material and the ONe degenerate core, or on a 1.0
Msun ONe white dwarf with 25% mixing.",2005-02-04T10:42:37Z
"Design of the Gaia photometric systems for stellar parametrization using
  a population-based optimizer","Large, deep surveys must typically rely on multiband photometry rather than
spectroscopy for determining the astrophysical properties (APs) of stars. Yet
designing an optimal photometric system for a wide range of objects is complex,
because it must trade off conflicting scientific requirements. I present a new
method for designing photometric systems and apply it to the Gaia Galactic
survey satellite, which will observe one billion stars brighter than V=20. The
principle is to optimally sample stellar spectra in order to best determine the
APs (e.g. Teff, [Fe/H], interstellar extinction). By considering a filter
system as a set of free parameters (central wavelengths, FWHM etc.), it may be
designed by optimizing a figure-of-merit (FoM) with respect to these
parameters. The FoM is a measure of how well the filter system can vectorially
'separate' stars in the data space to avoid AP degeneracies. The resulting
systems show some interesting features, in particular broad, overlapping
filters, which may be desirable from a multivariate classification perspective.
These systems are competitive with others proposed for Gaia.",2005-02-04T13:07:33Z
"Constraints on the distribution of absorption in the X-ray selected AGN
  population found in the 13H XMM-Newton/Chandra deep field","We present an analysis of the X-ray properties of sources detected in the 13H
XMM-Newton deep (200ks) field. In order to constrain the absorbed AGN
population, we use extensive Monte Carlo simulations to directly compare the
X-ray colours of observed sources with those predicted by several model
distributions. We have tested the simplest form of the AGN unified scheme,
whereby the intrinsic XLF of absorbed AGN is set to be the same as that of
their unabsorbed brethren, coupled with various model distributions of
absorption. The best fitting of these models sets the fraction of AGN with
absorbing column NH, proportional to (logNH)^8. We have also tested two
extensions to the unified scheme: an evolving absorption scenario, and a
luminosity dependent model distribution. Both of these provide poorer matches
to the observed X-ray colour distributions than the best fitting simple unified
model. We find that a luminosity dependent density evolution XLF reproduces
poorly the 0.5-2 keV source counts seen in the 13H field. Field to field
variations could be the cause of this disparity. Computing the simulated X-ray
colours with a simple absorbed power-law + reflection spectral model is found
to over-predict, by a factor of two, the fraction of hard sources that are
completely absorbed below 0.5 keV, implying that an additional source of
soft-band flux must be present for a number of the absorbed sources. Finally,
we show that around 40% of the 13H sample are expected to be AGN with NH>10^22
cm^-2.",2005-04-22T16:20:07Z
"Preparing the COROT space mission: new variable stars in the galactic
  Anticenter direction","The activities related to the preparation of the asteroseismic, photometric
space mission COROT are described. Photoelectric observations, wide--field CCD
photometry, uvbyB calibrations and further time--series have been obtained at
different observatories and telescopes. They have been planned to complete the
COROT programme in the direction of the galactic Anticenter. In addition to
suitable asteroseismic targets covering the different evolutionary stages
between ZAMS and TAMS, we discovered several other variable stars, both
pulsating and geometrical. We compared results on the incidence of variability
in the galactic Center and Anticenter directions. Physical parameters have been
obtained and evolutionary tracks fitting them have been calculated. The
peculiarities of some individual stars alre pointed out. Paper based on
observations collected at the San Pedro Martir, Sierra Nevada, Teide, La Silla,
Haute-Provence and Roque de Los Muchachos (Telescopio Nazionale Galileo and
Mercator telescopes) observatories.",2005-02-22T16:57:19Z
Chandra and XMM-Newton Observations of NGC 6251,"We present new X-ray observations of the nucleus, jet and extended emission
of the nearby radio galaxy NGC 6251 using the Chandra/ACIS-S camera, together
with a reanalysis of archival Chandra/ACIS-I and XMM-Newton/EPIC data. We find
that the nuclear X-ray spectrum is well-fitted with an absorbed power-law, and
that there is tentative, but not highly significant, evidence for Fe K$\alpha$
emission. We argue that the observed nuclear X-ray emission is likely to
originate in a relativistic jet, based on the double-peaked nature, and our
synchrotron self-Compton modelling, of the radio-to-X-ray spectral energy
distribution. However, we cannot rule out a contribution from an accretion
flow. We resolve X-ray jet emission in three distinct regions, and argue in
favour of a synchrotron origin for all three; inverse-Compton emission models
are possible but require extreme parameters. We detect thermal emission on both
galaxy and group scales, and demonstrate that hot gas can confine the jet,
particularly if relativistic beaming is important. We show evidence that the
radio lobe has evacuated a cavity in the X-ray-emitting gas, and suggest that
the lobe is close to the plane of the sky, with the jet entering the lobe close
to the surface nearest to the observer.",2005-02-09T12:00:58Z
Theoretical He I Emissivities in the Case B Approximation,"We calculate the He I case B recombination cascade spectrum using improved
radiative and collisional data. We present new emissivities over a range of
electron temperatures and densities. The differences between our results and
the current standard are large enough to have a significant effect not only on
the interpretation of observed spectra of a wide variety of objects but also on
determinations of the primordial helium abundance.",2005-02-10T20:08:45Z
Seismic Search for Strange Quark Nuggets,"Bounds on masses and abundances of Strange Quark Nuggets (SQNs) are inferred
from a seismic search on Earth. Potential SQN bounds from a possible seismic
search on the Moon are reviewed and compared with Earth capabilities. Bounds
are derived from the data taken by seismometers implanted on the Moon by the
Apollo astronauts. We show that the Apollo data implies that the abundance of
SQNs in the region of 10 kg to one ton must be at least an order of magnitude
less than would saturate the dark matter in the solar neighborhood.",2005-05-29T20:25:23Z
"Giant Planet Migration through the Action of Disk Torques and Planet
  Scattering","This paper presents a parametric study of giant planet migration through the
combined action of disk torques and planet-planet scattering. The torques
exerted on planets during Type II migration in circumstellar disks readily
decrease the semi-major axes, whereas scattering between planets increases the
orbital eccentricities. This paper presents a parametric exploration of the
possible parameter space for this migration scenario using two (initial)
planetary mass distributions and a range of values for the time scale of
eccentricity damping (due to the disk). For each class of systems, many
realizations of the simulations are performed in order to determine the
distributions of the resulting orbital elements of the surviving planets; this
paper presents the results of 8500 numerical experiments. Our goal is to study
the physics of this particular migration mechanism and to test it against
observations of extrasolar planets. The action of disk torques and
planet-planet scattering results in a distribution of final orbital elements
that fills the a-e plane, in rough agreement with the orbital elements of
observed extrasolar planets. In addition to specifying the orbital elements, we
characterize this migration mechanism by finding the percentages of ejected and
accreted planets, the number of collisions, the dependence of outcomes on
planetary masses, the time spent in 2:1 and 3:1 resonances, and the effects of
the planetary IMF. We also determine the distribution of inclination angles of
surviving planets and the distribution of ejection speeds for exiled planets.",2005-05-11T19:59:47Z
"A model for the population of helium stars in the Galaxy I. Low-mass
  stars","By means of population synthesis we model the Galactic ensemble of helium
stars. It is assumed that all helium stars are formed in binaries. Under this
assumption, single helium stars are produced by the mergers of helium remnants
of components of close binaries (mainly, by merging helium white dwarfs) and by
disruption of binaries with helium components in supernovae explosions. The
estimate of the total birthrate of helium stars in the Galaxy is 0.043
yr$^{-1}$, their total number is estimated as $4 \times 10^6$. The rate of
binarity in the total sample is 76%. We construct a subsample of low-mass
($M_{\rm He} \lesssim 2 \ms$) helium stars limited by observational selection
effects: stellar magnitude ($V_{\rm He} \leq 16$), ratio of stellar magnitudes
of components in binaries ($V_{\rm He}\leq V_{\rm comp}$), lower limit of the
semiamplitude of radial velocity that is necessary for discovery of binarity
($K_{min}=30$ km/s). The parameters of this ``observable'' sample are in
satisfactory agreement with the parameters of the observed ensemble of sdB
stars. In particular, in the selection-limited sample binarity rate is 58%. We
analyze the relations between orbital periods and masses of helium stars and
their companions in systems with different combinations of components. We
expect that overwhelming majority ($\sim 90$%) of unobserved components in
binary sdB stars are white dwarfs, predominantly, carbon-oxygen ones.",2005-04-28T13:41:17Z
Properties of galactic B[e] supergiants. IV. Hen3-298 and Hen3-303,"We present the results of optical and near-IR spectroscopic and near-IR
photometric observations of the emission-line stars Hen3-298 and Hen3-303.
Strong emission in the H-alpha line is found in both objects. The presence of
Fe II and [O I] emission lines in the spectrum of Hen3-298 indicates that it is
a B[e] star. The double-peaked CO line profiles, found in the infrared spectrum
of Hen3-298, along with the optical line profiles suggest that the star is
surrounded by a rotating circumstellar disk. Both objects also show infrared
excesses, similar to those of B[e] stars. The radial velocities of the
absorption and emission lines as well as a high reddening level suggest that
the objects are located in the Norma spiral arm at a distance of 3-4.5 kpc. We
estimated a luminosity of log (L/L_sun) ~ 5.1 and a spectral type of no earlier
than B3 for Hen3-298. Hen3-303 seems to be a less luminous B-type object (log
(L/L_sun) ~ 4.3), located in the same spiral arm.",2005-03-07T16:41:16Z
"The Filamentary Large Scale Structure around the z = 2.16 Radio Galaxy
  PKS 1138-262","PKS 1138-262 is a massive radio galaxy at z = 2.16 surrounded by
overdensities of Lya emitters, Ha emitters, EROs and X-ray emitters. Numerous
lines of evidence exist that it is located in a forming cluster. We report on
Keck spectroscopy of candidate members of this protocluster, including nine of
the 18 X-ray sources detected by Pentericci et al. (2002) in this field. Two of
these X-ray sources (not counting PKS 1138-262 itself) were previously
confirmed to be members of the protocluster; we have discovered that an
additional two (both AGN) are members of a filamentary structure, at least 3.5
Mpc in projection, aligned with the radio jet axis, the 150 kpc-sized
emission-line halo, and the extended X-ray emission around the radio galaxy.
Three of the nine X-ray sources observed are lower redshift AGN, and three are
M-dwarf stars.",2005-05-17T19:20:56Z
"Optical Afterglow Observations of the Unusual Short-Duration Gamma-Ray
  Burst 040924","The 1-m telescope at Lulin Observatory and the 0.76-m Katzman Automatic
Imaging Telescope at Lick Observatory were used to observe the optical
afterglow of the short-duration (1.2--1.5 s) gamma-ray burst (GRB) 040924. This
object has a soft high-energy spectrum, thus making it an exceptional case,
perhaps actually belonging to the short-duration tail of the long-duration
GRBs. Our data, combined with other reported measurements, show that the early
R-band light curve can be described by two power laws with index alpha = -0.7
(at t = 16-50 min) and alpha = -1.06 (at later times). The rather small
difference in the spectral indices can be more easily explained by an afterglow
model invoking a cooling break rather than a jet break.",2005-06-10T12:26:53Z
Extreme X-ray spectral variability in the Seyfert 2 Galaxy NGC 1365,"We present multiple Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of the type 1.8
Seyfert Galaxy NGC 1365, which shows the most dramatic X-ray spectral changes
observed so far in an AGN: the source switched from reflection dominated to
transmission dominated and back in just 6 weeks. During this time the soft
thermal component, arising from a ~1 kpc region around the center, remained
constant. The reflection component is constant at all timescales, and its high
flux relative to the primary component implies the presence of thick gas
covering a large fraction of the solid angle. The presence of this gas, and the
fast variability time scale, suggest that the Compton-thick to Compton thin
change is due to variation in the line-of-sight absorber, rather than to
extreme intrinsic emission variability. We discuss a structure of the
circumnuclear absorber/reflector which can explain the observed X-ray spectral
and temporal properties.",2005-03-16T16:04:43Z
Systematic Analysis of 22 Microlensing Parallax Candidates,"We attempt to identify all microlensing parallax events for which the
parallax fit improves \Delta\chi^2 > 100 relative to a standard microlensing
model. We outline a procedure to identify three types of discrete degeneracies
(including a new one that we dub the ``ecliptic degeneracy'') and find many new
degenerate solutions in 16 previously published and 6 unpublished events. Only
four events have one unique solution and the other 18 events have a total of 44
solutions. Our sample includes three previously identified black-hole (BH)
candidates. We consider the newly discovered degenerate solutions and determine
the relative likelihood that each of these is a BH. We find the lens of event
MACHO-99-BLG-22 is a strong BH candidate (78%), event MACHO-96-BLG-5 is a
marginal BH candidate (37%), and MACHO-98-BLG-6 is a weak BH candidate (2.2%).
The lens of event OGLE-2003-BLG-84 may be a Jupiter-mass free-floating planet
candidate based on a weak 3 sigma detection of finite-source effects. We find
that event MACHO-179-A is a brown dwarf candidate within ~100 pc of the Sun,
mostly due to its very small projected Einstein radius, \tilde r_E = 0.23+-0.05
AU. As expected, these microlensing parallax events are biased toward lenses
that are heavier and closer than average. These events were examined for
xallarap (or binary-source motion), which can mimic parallax. We find that 23%
of these events are strongly affected by xallarap.",2005-06-09T19:16:03Z
"A Multi-Instrument Study of the Helix Nebula Knots with the Hubble Space
  Telescope","We have conducted a combined observational and theoretical investigation of
the ubiquitous knots in the Helix Nebula (NGC 7293). We have constructed a
combined hydrodynamic+radiation model for the ionized portion of these knots
and have accurately calculated a static model for their molecular regions.
Imaging observations in optical emission lines were made with the Hubble Space
Telescope's STIS spectrograph, operating in a ""slitless"" mode, complemented by
WFPC2 images in several of the same lines. The NICMOS camera was used to image
the knots in molecular hydrogen. These observations, when combined with other
studies of molecular hydrogen and CO provide a complete characterization of the
knots. They possess dense molecular cores of densities about 1,000,000 per
cubic centimeter surrounded on the central star side by a zone of hot molecular
hydrogen. The temperature of the molecular hydrogen emitting layer defies
explanation either through detailed calculations for radiative equilibrium or
for simplistic calculations for shock excitation. Further away from the core is
the ionized zone, whose peculiar distribution of emission lines is explained by
the expansion effects of material flowing through this region. The shadowed
region behind the core is the source of most of the CO emission from the knot
and is of the low temperature expected for a radiatively heated molecular
region.",2005-04-08T16:17:05Z
"Radiative transfer in moving media II. Solution of the radiative
  transfer equation in axial symmetry","A new method for the formal solution of the 2D radiative transfer equation in
axial symmetry in the presence of arbitrary velocity fields is presented. The
combination of long and short characteristics methods is used to solve the
radiative transfer equation. We include the velocity field in detail using the
Local Lorentz Transformation. This allows us to obtain a significantly better
description of the photospheric region, where the gradient of the global
velocity is too small for the Sobolev approximation to be valid. Sample test
calculations for the case of a stellar wind and a rotating atmosphere are
presented.",2005-06-16T11:56:06Z
Universal GRB jets from jet-cocoon interaction in massive stars,"We consider the time-dependent evolution of a relativistic jet following its
breakout through the surface of a massive compact star, as envisaged in the
collapsar model of gamma-ray bursts. At breakout, the jet is tightly collimated
by the pressure of its hot cocoon, which is created as the jet traverses the
star. After breakout, the cocoon pressure drops and the jet expands toward its
natural opening angle. We show that the evolving opening angle of the jet
produces a stratification of the total energy with the off-axis angle,
resulting in a universal morphology. The angular structure is largely
independent of the initial beam pattern and depends only on the luminosity of
the central engine. With the minimal assumption of a constant energy release we
reproduce the theta^{-2} profile required to explain observations of
afterglows.",2005-02-04T01:05:11Z
The CIDA-UCM-Yale Shallow Survey for Emission Line Galaxies,"We present the CIDA-UCM-Yale (Centro de Investigaciones de Astronomia,
Universidad Complutense de Madrid and Yale University) survey for
Halpha+[NII]6549,6584 emission-line galaxies using objective-prism spectra. The
most important properties of a catalogue with 427 entries and significant
subsets are analysed. The complete sample contains 183 statistically confirmed
ELGs in a sky area of 151 sq.deg. and redshift up to 0.14. We determine the
parameters of the Halpha luminosity function using the Halpha+[NII] flux
directly measured on the ELGs spectra in this sample and the star formation
rate density derived is in agreement with the values reported in the
literature. Finally, we study the clustering properties of local star-forming
galaxies relative to quiescent ones from different perspectives. We find that
emission-line galaxies avoid dense regions of quiescent galaxies and we propose
a power-law expression to parametrise the relation between star formation rate
density and environment volume density of emission-line galaxies.",2005-02-23T19:28:31Z
Peak energy clustering and efficiency in compact objects,"We study the properties of plasmas containing a low energy thermal photon
component at comoving temperature \theta \equiv kT'/m_e c^2 \sim 10^{-5} -
10^{-2} interacting with an energetic electron component, characteristic of,
e.g., the dissipation phase of relativistic outflows in gamma-ray bursts
(GRB's), X-ray flashes, and blazars. We show that, for scattering optical
depths larger than a few, balance between Compton and inverse-Compton
scattering leads to the accumulation of electrons at values of $\gamma\beta ~
0.15 - 0.3$. For optical depths larger than ~ 100, this leads to a peak in the
comoving photon spectrum at 1-10 keV, very weakly dependent on the values of
the free parameters. In particular, these results are applicable to the
internal shock model of GRB, as well as to slow dissipation models, e.g. as
might be expected from reconnection, if the dissipation occurs at a
sub-photospheric radii. For GRB bulk Lorentz factors ~ 100, this results in
observed spectral peaks clustering in the 0.1-1 MeV range, with conversion
efficiencies of electron into photon energy in the BATSE range of ~ 30%.",2005-04-15T12:20:36Z
Interstellar deuterated ammonia: From NH3 to ND3,"We use spectra and maps of NH2D, ND2H, and ND3, obtained with the CSO, IRAM
30m and Arecibo telescopes, to study deuteration processes in dense cores. The
data include the first detection of the hyperfine structure of ND2H. The
emission of ND2H and ND3 does not seem to peak at the positions of the embedded
protostars, but instead at offset positions, where outflow interactions may
occur. A constant ammonia fractionation ratio in star-forming regions is
generally assumed to be consistent with an origin on dust grains. However, in
the pre-stellar cores studied here, the fractionation varies significantly when
going from NH3 to ND3. We present a steady state model of the gas-phase
chemistry for these sources, which includes passive depletion onto dust grains
and multiply saturated deuterated species up to five deuterium atoms (e.g.
CD5+). The observed column density ratios of all four ammonia isotopologues are
reproduced within a factor of 3 for a gas temperature of 10 K. We also predict
that deuterium fractionation remains significant at temperatures up to 20 K. ND
and NHD, which have rotational transitions in the submillimeter domain are
predicted to be abundant.",2005-04-20T16:27:54Z
Recent Searches for the Radio Lines of NH_3 in Comets,"Radio observations in the ammonia inversion lines of four comets, C/2001 A2
(LINEAR), 153P/Ikeya-Zhang, C/2001 Q4 (NEAT) and C/2002 T7 (LINEAR), were
performed at the Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope during their respective close
approaches to Earth. None of the four lowest energy metastable lines
(J,K=J),J=1--4, could be detected in these comets. We derive the following 3
sigma upper bounds on the NH_3 production rate, and c omparing to the
corresponding water production rates, percentage NH_3 abundances relative to
H_2O:
  Q(NH_3) < 1.9x10^26 s^-1 (0.63%) for C/2001 A2 (LINEAR),
  Q(NH_3) < 2.7x10^26 s^-1 (0.13%) for C/2001 Q4 (NEAT),
  Q(NH_3) < 2.3x10^27 s^-1 (0.74%) for C/2002 T7 (LINEAR) and Q(NH_3) <=
6.3x10^26 s^-1 (0.63%) for Comet 153P/Ikeya-Zhang.
  At 0.74% or less, the ammonia-to-water ratios are factors of 2 below the
value for C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp) and 1P/Halley, suggesting chemical diversity
between comets. The 18-cm lines of OH were clearly detected in the two comets
observed during the 2004 campaign, thereby validating the cometary ephemerides.",2005-05-20T13:47:08Z
Discovery of a stellar system in the background of 47 Tucanae,"We report on the discovery of a stellar system in the background of the
Galactic globular cluster 47 Tucanae (NGC 104), located 14.8' North-West of the
cluster center. The object, whose apparent diameter is D~30'', is partially
resolved into stars on the available CCD images, reaching a limiting magnitude
of V~22.5, and is detected as a significant (more than 5 sigma) overdensity of
blue stars (B-V<0.7). The color magnitude diagram of the system, its
characteristic projected size and its position in the sky suggest that it is an
intermediate-old age cluster belonging to the Small Magellanic Cloud, whose
outskirts lie in the background of 47 Tuc. Although less likely, the
possibility that the object is an unknown dwarf galaxy in the outskirts of the
Local Group cannot completely be ruled out by the present data.",2005-02-09T15:41:13Z
A Field Programmable Gate Array Spectrometer for Radio Astronomy,"We describe the technological concept and the first-light results of a
1024-channel spectrometer based on field programmable gate array (FPGA)
hardware. This spectrometer is the prototype for the seven beam L-band receiver
to be installed at the Effelsberg 100-m telescope in autumn 2005. Using
""of-the-shelf"" hardware and software products, we designed and constructed an
extremely flexible Fast-Fourier-Transform (FFT) spectrometer with unprecedented

spectrometer development in future radio astronomy.",2005-03-03T12:09:52Z
"Acceleration of Plasma Flows in the Solar Atmosphere Due to Magnetofluid
  Coupling - Simulation and Analysis","Within the framework of a two-fluid description possible pathways for the
generation of fast flows (dynamical as well as steady) in the lower solar
atmosphere is established. It is shown that a primary plasma flow (locally
sub-Alfv\'enic) is accelerated when interacting with emerging/ambient
arcade--like closed field structures. The acceleration implies a conversion of
thermal and field energies to kinetic energy of the flow. The time-scale for
creating reasonably fast flows ($\gtrsim 100$ km/s) is dictated by the initial
ion skin depth while the amplification of the flow depends on local $\beta $.
It is shown, for the first time, that distances over which the flows become
""fast"" are $\sim 0.01 R_s$ from the interaction surface; later the fast flow
localizes (with dimensions $\lesssim 0.05 R_S$) in the upper central region of
the original arcade. For fixed initial temperature the final speed ($\gtrsim
500 km/s$) of the accelerated flow, and the modification of the field structure
are independent of the time-duration (life-time) of the initial flow. In the
presence of dissipation, these flows are likely to play a fundamental role in
the heating of the finely structured Solar atmosphere.",2005-02-17T11:42:21Z
Spherical Collapse Model And Dark Energy(I),"In existing literatures about the top-hat spherical collapse model of galaxy
clusters formation in cosmology containing dark energies, dark energies are
usually assumed not to cluster on this scale. But all these literatures ignored
the current describing the flowing of dark energies outside the clusters which
should exist under this assumption, so the conclusions of these literatures are
worth further explorations. In this paper we study this model in QCDM or
Phantom-CDM cosmologies(flat) by assuming that dark energies will cluster
synchronously with ordinary matters on the scale of galaxy clusters so the dark
energy current flowing outside the clusters does not exist at all and find that
in this case, the key parameters of the model exhibit rather non-trivial and
remarkable dependence on the equation of state coefficients of dark energies.
We then apply the results in
  Press-Scheter theory and calculate the number density of galaxy clusters and
its evolutions. We find that this two quantities are both affected
exponentially by the equation of state coefficients of dark energies. We leave
the study of this model with the assumption that dark energies do not cluster
on the scale of galaxy clusters at all as the topic of another paper where
similar conclusions will be obtained also.",2005-05-09T13:34:13Z
An Exact Equilibrium Model of an Unbound Stellar System in a Tidal Field,"Star clusters and dwarf galaxies gradually dissolve as they move in the
potential of their host galaxy. Once their density falls below a certain
critical density (which is comparable with the background density of the
galaxy) it is often assumed that their evolution is completed. In fact the
remnant of such a system forms a distribution of stars which are unbound to
each other and which move on similar orbits in their host potential. With this
motivation we study the evolution of an idealised unbound system and follow its
expansion and dissolution in the tidal field of a model galaxy. Initially the
stars are uniformly distributed (with a density below the critical density)
within an ellipsoidal volume. The system itself travels on a circular orbit
within a galaxy modelled as an isothermal sphere. The initial velocities of the
stars are chosen by assuming that they move on (three-dimensional) epicycles
with guiding centre at the centre of the ellipsoid, though the usual epicyclic
theory is altered to account for the self-gravity of the system. This is
believed to be the first exact equilibrium model of a stellar system in a tidal
field. Our main task is to study the stability of such configurations and the
time-scale of their dissolution, as a function of the initial density and size
of the ellipsoid. If the time of dissolution is measured by an increase of the
half-mass radius of 50 %, we find that systems of low density (about 1 % of the
background density) and small radius (50 pc on an orbit of radius 10 kpc) can
survive for about 20 galactic orbits. For small systems we show that the
lifetime is approximately proportional to the inverse square root of the
density.",2005-02-18T12:38:59Z
"Accretion Disc Structure and Orientation in the Lensed and Microlensed
  Q0957+561 Quasar","Because quasars are unresolved in optical imaging, their structures must
presently be inferred. Gravitational microlensing offers the possibility to
produce information about the luminous structure provided the Einstein ring
diameter of the microlensing particle is comparable to or smaller than the
radiating quasar components. The long brightness history measured for the Q0957
quasar has been analyzed previously for information about the microlensing
particles, and evidence for the existence of a cosmologically significant
population of planetary mass particles has been reported. The microlensing
results have also directly determined the sizes of the ultraviolet light
emitting surfaces in the quasar Autocorrelation analysis of the same brightness
record has produced evidence for complex structure in the quasar; if the quasar
suddenly brightens today, it is probable that it will brighten again after 129,
190, 540, and 620 days. We interpret these lags as the result of luminous
structure around the quasar, and in particular we interpret them in the context
of the Elvis (2000) model of the quasar's structure. We find that the
autocorrelation peaks imply that beyond the luminous inner edge of the
accretion disc, the biconic structures of the Elvis model must lie at a radial
distance of 2x10^17 cm from the black hole, and 2x10^16 cm above and below the
plane of the accretion disc. The quasar is apparently inclined 55 degrees to
the line of sight. A second possible solution with lower inclination and larger
structure is also indicated but statistically less probable.",2005-04-18T19:01:52Z

Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies are studied. based on the relativistic
second-order theory of perturbations in nonzero-Lambda flat cosmological
models, which has been analytically derived by the present author, and on the
second-order formula of CMB anisotropies derived by Mollerach and Matarrese. In
this paper we derive the components of the CMB anisotropy power spectra in the
range of l = 1 -22 which are caused by asymmetric local inhomogeneities on
scales of 300 Mpc. Using our results it is found that there is a possibility to
explain the small north-south asymmetry of CMB anisotropies which has recently
been observed.",2005-05-09T02:27:15Z
"Particle acceleration in thick parallel shocks with high compression
  ratio","We report studies on first-order Fermi acceleration in parallel modified
shock waves with a large scattering center compression ratio expected from
turbulence transmission models. Using a Monte Carlo technique we have modeled
particle acceleration in shocks with a velocity ranging from nonrelativistic to
ultrarelativistic and a thickness extending from nearly steplike to very wide
structures exceeding the particle diffusion length by orders of magnitude. The
nonrelativistic diffusion approximation is found to be surprisingly accurate in
predicting the spectral index of a thick shock with large compression ratio
even in the cases involving relativistic shock speeds.",2005-05-30T12:51:58Z
"Structural properties of dwarf elliptical galaxies and the connection
  with (ordinary) elliptical galaxies","This article reviews the popular reasons for the belief that dwarf elliptical
galaxies and (ordinary) elliptical galaxies are distinct and separate species.
They include: light-profile shape (or similarly image concentration); the
magnitude-central surface brightness diagram; the magnitude-effective surface
brightness diagram (or similarly the magnitude-effective radius diagram); and
the Fundamental Plane. It is shown how a continuous trend between luminosity
and a) light-profile shape, and b) central surface brightness (until the onest
of core formation at M_B ~ -20.5 mag, results in a unification of the dwarf
elliptical and (ordinary) elliptical galaxies. Neither the above four reasons,
nor the luminosity function (at least in the Virgo cluster) provide evidence
for a division at M_B = -18 mag between the dwarf elliptical and (ordinary)
elliptical galaxies. Instead, they appear to be continuous extensions of each
other.",2005-05-20T08:41:14Z
On The Origin Of Unidentified EGRET Gamma-Ray Sources,"The identification of celestial gamma-ray sources with astronomical objects
or object classes has remained the initial and most fundamental key for
understanding their physical nature. The observational characteristic of a
gamma-ray emitter and the conditions under which an astronomical object is able
to produce energetic gamma-ray emission defines the range of candidates
available for source identifications. The main obstacle must be seen in the
fact that a gamma-ray source location is often imprecise, a flux history could
only be established on the basis of weeks, and uncertainties in the gamma-ray
observables are considerably large. Therefore coordinated multifrequency
follow-up campaigns or spatial-statistical methods are required to assign
proper counterpart identifications. Although Active Galactic Nuclei and pulsars
are uniquely identified EGRET sources, many other gamma-ray sources still
remain unidentified. I will review properties of the population and highlight
the characteristics of potential counterparts of the still unidentified
gamma-ray sources detected by EGRET.",2005-06-15T23:54:05Z
"Non-Gaussianity of one-point distribution functions in extended
  Lagrangian perturbation theory","We study the one-point probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the
peculiar velocity and the density fluctuation in a cosmological fluid. Within
the perturbative approach to the structure formation scenario, the effect of
``pressure'' has recently been an area of research interest. The velocity
dispersion of the cosmological fluid creates effective ``pressure'' or
viscosity terms. From this viewpoint, because the pressure reflects a nonlinear
effect of the motion of the fluid, the pressure model would include nonlinear
effects. Here we analyze the Lagrangian linear perturbation PDFs for both the
Zel'dovich approximation and the pressure model. We find that the PDFs of the
peculiar velocity remain Gaussian, even if we consider the pressure. For the
PDFs of the density fluctuation, the occurrence of non-Gaussianity depends on
the ``equation of state'' for the fluid. Therefore we distinguish the
``equation of state'' using the PDFs.",2005-04-08T15:45:34Z
Ep-Eiso Correlation in a Multiple Subjet Model of Gamma-Ray Bursts,"We perform Monte Carlo simulations to study Ep-Eiso correlation in the
context of a multiple subjet model (or inhomogeneous jet model) for gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs), X-ray--rich GRBs (XRRs), and X-ray flashes (XRFs). For a single
subjet, we find that Ep prop. Eiso^0.4 for large viewing angles. For the
multiple subjet model in which all the subjets have the same intrinsic
properties, off-axis events show Ep prop. Eiso^a with 0.4<a<0.5. If the
intrinsic properties of the subjets are distributed so that on-axis emission of
each subjet follows a correlation Ep prop. Liso^1/2, we obtain the Amati
correlation (Ep prop. Eiso^1/2) over three orders of magnitude in Ep. Although
the scatter around the Amati correlation is large in the simulation, the
results are consistent with the observed properties of GRBs with known
redshifts and the BASTE GRBs with pseudo redshifts derived from the
lag-luminosity correlation. We also calculate the event rates, the redshift
distributions, and the T90 duration distributions of GRBs, XRRs, and XRFs which
can be detected by HETE-2, assuming that the source redshift distribution is in
proportion to the cosmic star formation rate. It is found that the event rates
of three classes are comparable, that the average redshift of the XRRs is a
little larger than those of the GRBs and the XRFs, and that short XRRs arise
when a single subjet is viewed off-axis or viewed on-axis with slightly high
redshift.",2005-04-28T07:59:24Z
Abundances in giant stars of the globular cluster NGC 6752,"Recent theoretical yields and chemical evolution models demonstrate that
intermediate-mass AGB stars cannot reproduce the observed abundance
distributions of O, Na, Mg, and Al. As a further observational test of this
finding, we present elemental abundance ratios [X/Fe] for 20 elements in 38
bright giants of the globular cluster NGC 6752. Our mean abundance ratios
[X/Fe] are in good agreement with previous studies of this cluster and are also
consistent with other globular clusters and field stars at the same
metallicity. The mean abundance ratios [Ba/Eu] and [La/Eu] exhibit values, in
agreement with field stars at the same metallicity, that lie approximately
midway between the pure r-process and the solar (s-process + r-process) mix,
indicating that AGB stars have played a role in the chemical evolution of the
proto-cluster gas.
  For the first time, we find possible evidence for an abundance variation for
elements heavier than Al in this cluster. We find a correlation between [Si/Fe]
and [Al/Fe] which is consistent with the abundance anomalies being synthesized
via proton captures at high temperatures. Leakage from the Mg-Al chain into
28Si may explain the Si excess in stars with the highest [Al/Fe]. We identify
correlations between [Y/Fe] and [Al/Fe], [Zr/Fe] and [Al/Fe], and [Ba/Fe] and
[Al/Fe] suggesting that Y, Zr, and Ba abundances may increase by about 0.1 dex
as Al increases by about 1.3 dex. While the correlations are statistically
significant, the amplitudes of the variations are small. If the small
variations in Y, Zr, and Ba are indeed real, then the synthesis of the Al
anomalies must have taken place within an unknown class of stars that also ran
the s-process. [Abridged]",2005-04-13T14:09:24Z
"High-speed, energy-resolved, STJ observations of the AM Her system V2301
  Oph","We present high time-resolution optical energy-resolved photometry of the
eclipsing cataclysmic variable V2301 Oph made using the ESA S-Cam detector, an
array of photon counting super-conducting tunnel junction (STJ) devices with
intrinsic energy resolution. Three eclipses were observed, revealing
considerable variation in the eclipse shape, particularly during ingress. The
eclipse shape is shown to be understood in terms of AM Her accretion via a
bright stream, with very little contribution from the white dwarf photosphere
and/or hotspot. About two thirds of the eclipsed light arises in the threading
region. Variation in the extent of the threading region can account for most of
the variations observed between cycles. Spectral fits to the data reveal a
10,000K blackbody continuum with strong, time-varying emission lines of
hydrogen and helium. This is the first time that stellar emission lines have
been detected in the optical band using a non-dispersive photon-counting
system.",2005-02-02T14:43:37Z
Z-bursts from the Virgo cluster,"Resonant annihilation of ultra-high energy cosmic neutrinos (UHECnu) on the
cosmic neutrino background (CnuB) into Z bosons--the Z-burst mechanism--and its
associated absorption and emission phenomenology provide a unique, albeit
indirect, probe of the CnuB in its present state. In this paper, we examine the
implications of gravitational clustering of the CnuB in nearby galaxy clusters
for the Z-burst phenomenology. In particular, we study the emission features of
the Z-decay products originating from the Virgo cluster, and the potential of
future cosmic ray experiments to observe clustering-enhanced Z-burst rates. We
find that a detector with an exposure equivalent to three years of observations
at the Extreme Universe Space Observatory (EUSO) will very likely measure these
enhanced rates together with the associated UHECnu flux, provided that the
latter saturates current observational limits and the neutrino masses are
quasi-degenerate, m_nu_i < 0.1 eV. In the case of UHECnu fluxes below the
electromagnetic cascade limit, or a hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum, an
experimental sensitivity exceeding that of EUSO by at least two orders of
magnitude is required to detect the clustering enhancements with any certainty.",2005-05-27T17:27:17Z
Collisionless Damping of Fast MHD Waves in Magneto-rotational Winds,"We propose collisionless damping of fast MHD waves as an important mechanism
for the heating and acceleration of winds from rotating stars. Stellar rotation
causes magnetic field lines anchored at the surface to form a spiral pattern
and magneto-rotational winds can be driven. If the structure is a magnetically
dominated, fast MHD waves generated at the surface can propagate almost
radially outward and cross the field lines. The propagating waves undergo
collisionless damping owing to interactions with particles surfing on magnetic
mirrors that are formed by the waves themselves. The damping is especially
effective where the angle between the wave propagation and the field lines
becomes moderately large ($\sim 20$ to $80^{\circ}$). The angle tends naturally
to increase into this range because the field in magneto-rotational winds
develops an increasingly large azimuthal component. The dissipation of the wave
energy produces heating and acceleration of the outflow. We show using
specified wind structures that this damping process can be important in both
solar-type stars and massive stars that have moderately large rotation rates.
This mechanism can play a role in coronae of young solar-type stars which are
rapidly rotating and show X-ray luminosities much larger than the sun. The
mechanism could also be important for producing the extended X-ray emitting
regions inferred to exist in massive stars of spectral type middle B and later.",2005-05-02T07:26:37Z
"The uBVI Photometric System. I. Motivation, Implementation, and
  Calibration","This paper describes the design principles for a CCD-based photometric system
that is highly optimized for ground-based measurement of the size of the Balmer
jump in stellar energy distributions. It is shown that, among ultraviolet
filters in common use, the Thuan-Gunn u filter is the most efficient for this
purpose. This filter is combined with the standard Johnson-Kron-Cousins B, V,
and I bandpasses to constitute the uBVI photometric system.
  Model stellar atmospheres are used to calibrate color-color diagrams for the
uBVI system in terms of the fundamental stellar parameters of effective
temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity. The u-B index is very sensitive
to log g, but also to [Fe/H]. It is shown that an analog of the Str\""omgren c_1
index, defined as (u-B)-(B-V), is much less metallicity dependent, but still
sensitive to log g. The effect of interstellar reddening on u-B is determined
through synthetic photometric calculations, and practical advice is given on
dealing with flat fields, atmospheric extinction, the red leak in the u filter,
and photometric reductions.
  The uBVI system offers a wide range of applicability in detecting stars of
high luminosity in both young (yellow supergiants) and old (post-AGB stars)
populations, using stars of both types as standard candles to measure
extragalactic distances with high efficiency, and in exploring the horizontal
branch in globular clusters. In many stellar applications, it can profitably
replace the classical uBVI system.
  Paper II in this series will present a network of well-calibrated standard
stars for the uBVI system.",2005-03-03T20:32:16Z
Precision Determination of the Mass Function of Dark Matter Halos,"The predicted mass function of dark matter halos is essential in connecting
observed galaxy cluster counts and models of galaxy clustering to the
properties of the primordial density field. We determine the mass function in
the concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, as well as its uncertainty, using
sixteen $1024^3$-particle nested-volume dark-matter simulations, spanning a
mass range of over five orders of magnitude. Using the nested volumes and
single-halo tests, we find and correct for a systematic error in the
friends-of-friends halo-finding algorithm. We find a fitting form and full
error covariance for the mass function that successfully describes the
simulations' mass function and is well-behaved outside the simulations'
resolutions. Estimated forecasts of uncertainty in cosmological parameters from
future cluster count surveys have negligible contribution from remaining
statistical uncertainties in the central cosmology multiplicity function. There
exists a potentially non-negligible cosmological dependence (non-universality)
of the halo multiplicity function.",2005-06-16T20:24:26Z
The properties of Galactic globular cluster sub-systems,"In this paper we compare the properties of three sub-systems of Galactic
globular clusters, which are defined according to metallicity and HB
morphology. We focus on cluster luminosities, structures, surface brightnesses
(SB) and ellipticities. It is shown that the so-called ""young"" halo (YH)
clusters, which may have been formed in external satellite galaxies, exhibit
characteristics clearly distinct from those of the ""old"" halo (OH) and
bulge/disk (BD) clusters, the majority of which are believed to be Galactic
natives. The YH clusters have properties most similar to those of clusters
belonging to several present day satellite dwarf galaxies. The OH and BD
populations have apparently been modified by destructive tidal forces in the
inner Galaxy. We estimate that the present population of Galactic natives may
only represent some two-thirds of the original population. Several low SB
clusters are highly flattened. We briefly speculate that this ellipticity may
represent the intrinsic flattening of dark matter mini-halos in which such
optically dim clusters might be embedded. Finally, we examine the distribution
of clusters on the size vs.luminosity plane. Three objects fall above the sharp
upper envelope of the main distribution on this plane: Omega Cen, M54, and NGC
2419. All three have previously, and independently, been suggested to be the
stripped cores of former dwarf galaxies. This suspicion is strengthened by the
observation that the massive cluster G1 in M31, plus a number of the most
luminous clusters in NGC 5128 also fall in the same region of the plane. All of
these objects have also previously been suggested to be the stripped cores of
now-defunct dwarf galaxies.",2005-04-06T11:02:00Z
Discovery of 10 pulsars in an Arecibo drift-scan survey,"We present the results of a 430-MHz survey for pulsars conducted during the
upgrade to the 305-m Arecibo radio telescope. Our survey covered a total of
1147 square degrees of sky using a drift-scan technique. We detected 33
pulsars, 10 of which were not known prior to the survey observations. The
highlight of the new discoveries is PSR J0407+1607, which has a spin period of
25.7 ms, a characteristic age of 1.5 Gyr and is in a 1.8-yr orbit about a
low-mass (>0.2 Msun) companion. The long orbital period and small eccentricity
(e = 0.0009) make the binary system an important new addition to the ensemble
of binary pulsars suitable to test for violations of the strong equivalence
principle. We also report on our initially unsuccessful attempts to detect
optically the companion to J0407+1607 which imply that its absolute visual
magnitude is > 12.1. If, as expected on evolutionary grounds, the companion is
an He white dwarf, our non-detection imples a cooling age of least 1 Gyr.",2005-04-01T10:59:07Z
Indirect Search for Dark Matter,"Possible dark matter candidates are reviewed as well as indirect search
methods based on annihilation or decay channels of these particles. Neutralino
is presently the best particle candidate and its annihilation produces high
energy neutrinos, antiprotons, positrons and gamma-rays. To date, only upper
limits on neutrino fluxes from the center of the Earth or the Sun, were
established by different experiments. Antiprotons detected by the BESS
collaboration, if issued from the follow up hadronization of the annihilation
process, exclude neutralino masses higher than 100 GeV. The EGRET gamma-ray
residual emission seen at high galactic latitudes above 1 GeV could be
explained by neutralino annihilations if: i) the dark matter profile is ""cored""
and ii) the neutralino mass is < 50 GeV. Sterile neutrinos in the keV mass
range are a possible candidate to constitute warm dark matter. These particles
may provide an adequate free streaming mass able to solve ""some"" difficulties
present in the cold dark matter scenario at small scales and could also explain
the natal kick of pulsars. MeV particles, dubbed ""light"" dark matter, proposed
to explain the extended 511 keV line emission from the galactic center will
also be discussed.",2005-03-17T06:39:06Z
Lithium enhancement in X-ray binaries due to stellar rotation,"We discuss the high lithium abundances in the secondary stars of X-ray
binaries. We show that no lithium production in these stars is necessary, and
that the abundances can be explained simply due to the tidally locked rotation
of the stars, which lead naturally to slower lithium destruction rates. The
differences in abundances of CVs' secondaries from those of LMXBs had
previously been put forth as evidence that the compact object was related to
the lithium abundance, but this scenario also accounts for the lower lithium
abundances in the secondary stars in cataclysmic variable systems (CVs) than in
low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), since these stars have typically lived much
longer before becoming tidally locked short period systems. We point out that
if this scenario is correct, then the globular cluster X-ray binaries' donor
stars should, as a class, show less lithium enhancement relative to other stars
of the same spectral type in the clusters than the field X-ray binaries' donor
stars show.",2005-03-09T12:35:26Z
"Constraints on the dark energy equation of state from the separation of
  CMB peaks and the evolution of alpha","We introduce a simple parametrization of the dark energy equation of state,
\omega, which is motivated from theory and recent experimental data. The theory
is related to the tracker solution to alleviate the fine tuning problem. Recent
experimental data indicates that the present value of \omega is close to -1. We
analyze the evolution of \omega from the separation of CMB peaks and the time
variation of the fine structure constant, \alpha. We find that -1.00 \leq
\omega^{(0)} \leq -0.971_{-0.027}^{+0.017} and 1.76_{-0.42}^{+0.29} \times
10^{-4} \leq (d \omega / dz)_{z=0} \leq 0.041_{-0.037}^{+0.016} at 95%
confidence level (CL).",2005-04-28T22:32:56Z
"TRIDENT: an Infrared Differential Imaging Camera Optimized for the
  Detection of Methanated Substellar Companions","A near-infrared camera in use at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT)
and at the 1.6-m telescope of the Observatoire du Mont-Megantic is described.
The camera is based on a Hawaii-1 1024x1024 HgCdTe array detector. Its main
feature is to acquire three simultaneous images at three wavelengths across the
methane absorption bandhead at 1.6 microns, enabling, in theory, an accurate
subtraction of the stellar point spread function (PSF) and the detection of
faint close methanated companions. The instrument has no coronagraph and
features fast data acquisition, yielding high observing efficiency on bright
stars. The performance of the instrument is described, and it is illustrated by
laboratory tests and CFHT observations of the nearby stars GL526, Ups And and
Chi And. TRIDENT can detect (6 sigma) a methanated companion with delta H = 9.5
at 0.5"" separation from the star in one hour of observing time. Non-common path
aberrations and amplitude modulation differences between the three optical
paths are likely to be the limiting factors preventing further PSF attenuation.
Instrument rotation and reference star subtraction improve the detection limit
by a factor of 2 and 4 respectively. A PSF noise attenuation model is presented
to estimate the non-common path wavefront difference effect on PSF subtraction
performance.",2005-04-28T23:50:18Z
The Unified Equation of State for Dark Matter and Dark Energy,"We assume that dark matter and dark energy satisfy the unified equation of
state: $p=B(z)\rho$, with $p=p_{dE}$, $\rho=\rho_{dm}+\rho_{dE}$, where the
pressure of dark matter $p_{dm}=0$ has been taken into account. A special
function $B=-\frac{A}{(1+z)^{\alpha}}$ is presented, which can well describe
the evolution of the universe. In this model, the universe will end up with a
Big Rip. By further simple analysis, we know other choices of the function $B$
can also describe the universe but lead to a different doomsday.",2005-04-05T01:30:50Z
"Near-UV Observations of CS29497-030: New Constraints on Neutron-Capture
  Nucleosynthesis Processes","Employing spectra obtained with the new Keck I HIRES near-UV sensitive
detector, we have performed a comprehensive chemical composition analysis of
the binary blue metal-poor star CS29497-030. Abundances for 29 elements and
upper limits for an additional seven have been derived, concentrating on
elements largely produced via neutron-capture nucleosynthesis. Included in our
analysis are the two elements that define the termination point of the slow
neutron-capture process, lead and bismuth. We determine an extremely high value
of [Pb/Fe] = +3.65 +/- 0.07 (sigma = 0.13) from three features, supporting the
single-feature result obtained in previous studies. We also detect Bi for the
first time in a metal-poor star. Our derived Bi/Pb ratio is in accord with
those predicted from the most recent FRANEC calculations of the slow
neutron-capture process in low-mass AGB stars. We find that the neutron-capture
elemental abundances of CS29497-030 are best explained by an AGB model that
also includes very significant amounts of pre-enrichment of rapid
neutron-capture process material in the protostellar cloud out of which the
CS29497-030 binary system formed. Thus, CS29497-030 is both an ``r+s'' and
``extrinsic AGB'' star. Furthermore, we find that the mass of the AGB model can
be further constrained by the abundance of the light odd-element [Na/Fe] which
is sensitive to the neutron excess.",2005-04-29T22:45:35Z
"The application of a Trous wave filtering and Monte Carlo analysis on
  SECIS 2001 solar eclipse observations","8000 images of the Solar corona were captured during the June 2001 total
Solar eclipse. New software for the alignment of the images and an automated
technique for detecting intensity oscillations using multi scale wavelet
analysis were developed. Large areas of the images covered by the Moon and the
upper corona were scanned for oscillations and the statistical properties of
the atmospheric effects were determined. The a Trous wavelet transform was used
for noise reduction and Monte Carlo analysis as a significance test of the
detections. The effectiveness of those techniques is discussed in detail.",2005-04-07T17:10:16Z
Core Collapse via Coarse Dynamic Renormalization,"In the context of the recently developed ""equation-free"" approach to
computer-assisted analysis of complex systems, we extract the self-similar
solution describing core collapse of a stellar system from numerical
experiments. The technique allows us to side-step the core ""bounce"" that occurs
in direct N-body simulations due to the small-N correlations that develop in
the late stages of collapse, and hence to follow the evolution well into the
self-similar regime.",2005-04-25T15:26:09Z
"The HST view of the nuclear emission line region in low luminosity
  radio-galaxies","We study the properties of the emission line regions in two samples of low
luminosity radio-galaxies (LLRG), focusing on the compact emission line region
(CELR) revealed to be a characteristic feature of these objects by HST
narrow-band imaging. We find a strong correlation between line and optical
continuum nuclear emission, suggesting that the optical cores (most likely of
non thermal origin) can be directly associated to the source of ionizing
photons, i.e. that we are seeing a jet-ionized narrow line region. A photon
budget argument indicates that the optical nuclear sources produce a sufficient
photon flux provided that the covering factor of the circum-nuclear gas is
rather large, on average ~ 0.3. Analysis of HST images and spectra suggests
that the CELR may take the form of a pc-scale, high filling factor, structure,
possibly an optically thin torus. Estimates of the CELR mass lead to values as
small as 10 - 1000 solar masses and photon counting sets a limit to the BLR
mass of 0.01 solar masses. When considered together with the low accretion rate
and the tenuous torus structure, a general paucity of gas in the innermost
regions of LLRG emerges as the main characterizing difference from more
powerful AGN.",2005-04-26T08:04:22Z
"Primordial Magnetic Fields from Out of Equilibrium Cosmological Phase
  Transitions","The universe cools down monotonically following its expansion.This generates
a sequence of phase transitions. If a second order phase transition happens
during the radiation dominated era with a charged order parameter, spinodal
unstabilities generate large numbers of charged particles. These particles
hence produce magnetic fields.We use out of equilibrium field theory methods to
study the dynamics in a mean field or large N setup.The dynamics after the
transition features two distinct stages: a spinodal regime dominated by linear
long wave length instabilities, and a scaling stage in which the
non-linearities and backreaction of the scalar fields are dominant. This second
stage describes the growth of horizon sized domains. We implement a formulation
based on the non equilibrium Schwinger-Dyson equations to obtain the spectrum
of magnetic fields that includes the dissipative effects of the plasma. We find
that large scale magnetogenesis is efficient during the scaling regime. Charged
scalar field fluctuations with wavelengths of the order of the Hubble radius
induce large scale magnetogenesis via loop effects.The leading processes
are:pair production, pair annihilation and low energy bremsstrahlung, these
processes while forbidden in equilibrium are allowed strongly out of
equilibrium. The ratio between the energy density on scales larger than L and
that in the background radiation r(L,T)= rho_B(L,T)/rho_{cmb}(T) is r(L,T) ~
10^{-34} at the Electroweak scale and r(L,T) ~ 10^{-14} at the QCD scale for L
sim 1 Mpc. The resulting spectrum is insensitive to the magnetic diffusion
length and equipartition between electric and magnetic fields does not hold. We
conjecture that a similar mechanism could be operative after the QCD chiral
phase transition.",2005-02-10T11:49:18Z
"Spitzer Identification of the Least Massive Known Brown Dwarf with a
  Circumstellar Disk","Using the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope, we
have obtained mid-infrared photometry of the least massive known brown dwarf in
the Chamaeleon I star-forming region. For this young brown dwarf, OTS 44, we
have constructed a spectral energy distribution (SED) from 0.8-8 um by
combining the measurements at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 um from IRAC with
ground-based photometry at I, J, H, and K. The resulting SED for OTS 44
exhibits significant excess emission longward of 3 um relative to the SED
expected from the photosphere of the brown dwarf. We have successfully modeled
the source of this excess emission in terms of an irradiated viscous accretion
disk with M'<=10^-10 M_sun/year. With a spectral type of M9.5 and a mass of ~15
M_Jup, OTS 44 is now the coolest and least massive brown dwarf observed to have
a circumstellar disk. These measurements demonstrate that disks exist around
brown dwarfs even down to the deuterium burning mass limit and the approximate
upper mass limit of extrasolar planetary companions.",2005-02-04T13:30:21Z
Discovery of CH and OH in the -513 km s-1 Ejecta of Eta Carinae,"The very massive star, Eta Carinae, is enshrouded in an unusual complex of
stellar ejecta, which is highly depleted in C and O, and enriched in He and N.
This circumstellar gas gives rise to distinct absorption components
corresponding to at least 20 different velocities along the line-of-sight. The
velocity component at -513 kms-1 exhibits very low ionization with
predominantly neutral species of iron-peak elements. Our statistical
equilibrium/photoionization modeling indicates that the low temperature (T =
760 K) and high density (n_H=10^7 cm^-3) of the -513 kms-1 component is
conducive to molecule formation including those with the elements C and O.
Examination of echelle spectra obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging
Spectrograph (STIS) aboard the confirms the model's predictions. The molecules,
H_2, CH, and most likely OH, have been identified in the -513 kms-1 absorption
spectrum. This paper presents the analysis of the HST/STIS spectra with the
deduced column densities for CH, OH and C I, and upper limit for CO. It is
quite extraordinary to see molecular species in a cool environment at such a
high velocity. The sharp molecular and ionic absorptions in this extensively
CNO- processed material offers us a unique environment for studying the
chemistry, dust formation processes, and nucleosynthesis in the ejected layers
of a highly evolved massive star.",2005-05-17T18:40:09Z
Simulations of Stellar Collisions Involving Pre-Main Sequence Stars,"In this paper, we present the results of smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH)
simulations of collisions between pre-main sequence stars and a variety of
other kinds of stars. Simulations over a range of impact parameters and
velocities were performed. We find that pre-main sequence stars tend to ``wrap
themselves'' around their impactor. We discuss the probable evolutionary state
of products of collisions between pre-main sequence stars and pre-main
sequence, main sequence, giant branch, and compact stars. The nature of the
collision product does not depend strongly on the impact parameter or the
velocity of the collision.",2005-03-21T18:43:51Z
"Stellar Populations in Ten Clump-Cluster Galaxies of the Ultra Deep
  Field","Color-color diagrams for the clump and interclump emission in 10
clump-cluster galaxies of the Ultra Deep Field are made from B,V,i, and z
images and compared with models to determine redshifts, star formation
histories, and galaxy masses. The clump colors suggest declining star formation
over the last ~0.3 Gy, while the interclump emission is older. The clump
luminous masses are typically 6x10^8 Msun and their diameters average 1.8 kpc.
Total galaxy luminous masses average 6.5x10^10 Msun. The distribution of axial
ratios is consistent with a thick disk geometry. The ages of the clumps are
longer than their internal dynamical times by a factor of ~8, so they are
stable clusters, but the clump densities are only ~10 times the limiting tidal
densities, so they could be deformed by tidal forces. This is consistent with
the observation that some clumps have tails. The clumps could form by
gravitational instabilities in accreting disk gas, or they could be captured as
gas-rich dwarf galaxies. Support for this second possibility comes from the
high abundance of nearly identical bare clumps in the UDF field. Several
clump-clusters have disk densities that are much larger than in local disks,
suggesting they do not survive but get converted into ellipticals by
collisions.",2005-04-01T18:22:56Z
"X-Ray Spectra of the Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 Galaxy Ton S180 in Comparison
  with Galactic Black Holes","An analysis was made of 0.3-15 keV X-ray spectra of a Narrow-Line Seyfert 1
Galaxy, Ton S180, using archival data from ASCA, RXTE, and XMM-Newton. At
energies above 2.5 keV, a power-law with a photon index of ~ 2.3 successfully
and consistently reproduced the spectra from all of these observatories.
Assuming this power-law component to extend toward lower energies, a soft
excess, which is one of the most remarkable features of Narrow-Line Seyfert 1
Galaxies, is explained by another power-law multiplied by a thermal cutoff at ~
0.4 keV. Some similarities have been observed between this object and Galactic
black hole binaries in very high state, the latter being realized under high
accretion rates. Attempts have been made to interpret the soft excess in terms
of Comptonization of the disk photons by an electron cloud surrounding the
accretion disk, like BHBs in a very high state.",2005-04-05T09:17:32Z
"HST/STIS Spectroscopy of the Lyman-Alpha Emission Line in the Central
  Dominant Galaxies in A426, A1795, and A2597: Constraints on Clouds in the
  Intracluster Medium","We report on HST/STIS spectra of the Lyman-alpha emission in the central
dominant galaxies in three rich clusters of galaxies. We find evidence for a
population of clouds in the intracluster medium.We detect 10 Ly-alpha
absorption systems towards the nucleus of NGC1275 with columns of N(HI)
1E12-1E14 cm-2. The detected absorption features are most consistent with
associated nuclear absorption systems. There is very little nuclear absorption
at the systemic velocity in NGC1275. This implies that the large columns
detected in the 21 cm line towards the parsec scale radio source avoid the line
of sight to the nucleus. This gas may be located in a circumnuclear disk or
torus. We detect at least one and possibly two absorption features towards the
extended Ly-alpha in A426. We do not detect absorption towards the extended
Ly-alpha emission in A1795, and A2597 with upper limits N(HI) 1E13 cm-2 for
optically thin absorbers. Our data constrain the covering factor of any high
column density gas in the ICM to be less than 25%. Our results suggest that the
lack of observed intermediate temperature gas is not explained by obscuration.
In addition, the low columns of gas on the 100 kpc scales in the ICM suggests
that (1) the rate at which cold gas accumulates in the ICM on these scales is
very low, and (2) the dense nebulae in the central 10 kpc must have cooled or
been deposited in situ.",2005-06-13T15:26:54Z
Pioneer Anomaly and the Kuiper Belt mass distribution,"Pioneer 10 and 11 were the first probes sent to study the outer planets of
the Solar System and Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to leave the Solar
System. Besides their already epic journeys, Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft were
subjected to an unaccounted effect interpreted as a constant acceleration
toward the Sun, the so-called Pioneer anomaly. One of the possibilities put
forward for explaining the Pioneer anomaly is the gravitational acceleration of
the Kuiper Belt. In this work we examine this hypothesis for various models for
the Kuiper Belt mass distribution. We find that the gravitational effect due to
the Kuiper Belt cannot account for the Pioneer anomaly. Furthermore, we have
also studied the hypothesis that drag forces can explain the the Pioneer
anomaly; however we conclude that the density required for producing the
Pioneer anomaly is many orders of magnitude greater than those of
interplanetary and interstellar dust. Our conclusions suggest that only through
a mission, the Pioneer anomaly can be confirmed and further investigated. If a
mission with these aims is ever sent to space, it turns out, on account of our
results, that it will be also a quite interesting probe to study the mass
distribution of the Kuiper Belt.",2005-06-15T01:26:11Z
The Ultraluminous X-ray Sources NGC 1313 X-1 and X-2,"We present a detailed analysis of XMM archival data of two Ultraluminous
X-ray Sources (ULXs) in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 1313: NGC 1313 X-1 and
X-2. The spectral continuum of these sources was modeled with a soft thermal
component plus a power-law. If the soft component originates from an accretion
disk, the inferred mass of the compact remnant is > 100 M_sun, making it an
Intermediate Mass Black Hole (IMBH). A detailed analysis of the residuals of
the XMM EPIC-pn spectrum shows some evidence for the presence of an Oxygen
emission line in NGC 1313 X-1. The simultaneous presence of an excess in
emission, although at a much reduced significance level, at different energies
in the X-ray spectra of NGC 1313 X-1 and X-2 is suggestive of typical emission
lines from young supernova remnants. An optical counterpart for NGC 1313 X-2
was also identified. On an ESO 3.6 m image, the Chandra error box embraces a R
\~ 23 mag stellar-like object and excludes a previously proposed optical
counterpart.",2005-06-15T12:40:51Z
Correspondence principle between spherical and Euclidean wavelets,"Wavelets on the sphere are reintroduced and further developed independently
of the original group theoretic formalism, in an equivalent, but more
straightforward approach. These developments are motivated by the interest of
the scale-space analysis of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies
on the sky. A new, self-consistent, and practical approach to the wavelet
filtering on the sphere is developed. It is also established that the inverse
stereographic projection of a wavelet on the plane (i.e. Euclidean wavelet)
leads to a wavelet on the sphere (i.e. spherical wavelet). This new
correspondence principle simplifies the construction of wavelets on the sphere
and allows to transfer onto the sphere properties of wavelets on the plane. In
that regard, we define and develop the notions of directionality and
steerability of filters on the sphere. In the context of the CMB analysis,
these notions are important tools for the identification of local directional
features in the wavelet coefficients of the signal, and for their
interpretation as possible signatures of non-gaussianity, statistical
anisotropy, or foreground emission. But the generic results exposed may find
numerous applications beyond cosmology and astrophysics.",2005-02-23T18:13:10Z
"Metric Tests for Curvature from Weak Lensing and Baryon Acoustic
  Oscillations","We describe a practical measurement of the curvature of the Universe which
relies purely on the properties of the Robertson-Walker metric rather than any
model for the dynamics or content of the Universe. The cross-correlation
between foreground mass and gravitational shear of background galaxies depends
upon the angular diameter distances d_A(z_l), d_A(z_s), and d_A(z_s,z_l) on the
degenerate triangle formed by observer, source, and lens. In a flat Universe,
d_A(z_l,z_s) = d_A(z_s)-d_A(z_l), but in curved Universes an additional term
$\propto\Omega_k$ alters the lensing observables even if d_A(z) is fixed. Weak
lensing data may be used to solve simultaneously for d_A and the curvature.
This method is completely insensitive to: the equation of state; amendments to
the General Relativity formulae for the deflection of light or the growth of
structure; or biases in the photometric redshift scale. There is however a
degeneracy among d_A, $\Omega_k$ and the galaxy bias factors, that can be
broken by using measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations with the same
imaging data. Ambitious weak-lensing + baryon-oscillation surveys would measure
$\Omega_k$ to an accuracy $\approx0.04 f_{\rm sky}^{-1/2} (\sigma_{\ln
z}/0.04)^{1/2}$, where $\sigma_{\ln z}$ is the photometric redshift error. We
also predict bounds on curvature and other parameters in the context of
specific dark-energy models, and compare to other analyses of the weak lensing
cross-correlation method. We find both curvature and parametric constraints to
be surprisingly insensitive to systematic shear calibration errors.",2005-03-11T21:00:39Z
"Comparative Direct Analysis of Spectra of Type Ia Supernovae. I. SN
  1994D","As the first step in a comprehensive, comparative, direct analysis of the
spectra of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), we use the parameterized supernova
synthetic-spectrum code, SYNOW, to interpret 26 spectra of the well-observed SN
1994D. Our results are consistent with the traditional view that the
composition structure (element abundance fractions versus ejection velocity) is
radially stratified. We find that resonance-scattering features due to
permitted lines of Ca II, Na I, and Fe II persist to more than 100 days after
explosion. The fitting parameters for SN 1994D, together with those to be
determined for other SNe Ia, will provide an internally consistent
quantification of the spectroscopic diversity among SNe Ia, and shed light on
how the various manifestations of observational diversity are related to their
physical causes.",2005-03-07T21:44:57Z
X-ray sources in globular clusters of other galaxies,"A large number of X-ray sources in globular clusters of galaxies other than
the Milky Way has been found with Chandra. We discuss three issues relating to
these sources. The X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of the sources in globular
clusters of M31 is marginally compatible with the XLF of globular clusters of
the Milky Way. The individual XLFs of a dozen elliptical galaxies, after
correction for incompleteness, are compatible with one another and show no
break; however, the XLF found by adding the individual XLFs of elliptical
galaxies has a break at L_x about 5x10(38) ergs/s. For the moment there is no
evidence for a difference between the XLFs of sources inside and outside
globular clusters of elliptical galaxies. It is not (yet?) possible to decide
which fraction of low-mass X-ray binaries in elliptical galaxies outside
globular clusters have formed inside globular clusters.",2005-03-07T15:28:38Z
"The Strengths of Near-Infrared Absorption Features Relevant to
  Interstellar and Planetary Ices","The abundances of ices in planetary environments have historically been
obtained through measurements of near-infrared absorption features (lambda =
1.0-2.5 microns), and near-IR transmission measurements of materials present in
the interstellar medium are becoming more common. For transmission
measurements, the band strength (or absorption intensity) of an absorption
feature must be known in order to determine the column density of an ice
component. In the experiments presented here, we have measured the band
strengths of the near-IR absorption features for several molecules relevant to
the study of interstellar icy grain mantles and icy planetary bodies: CO
(carbon monoxide), CO2 (carbon dioxide), C3O2 (carbon suboxide), CH4 (methane),
H2O (water), CH3OH (methanol), and NH3 (ammonia). During a vacuum deposition,
the sizes of the near-IR features were correlated with that of a studied mid-IR
feature whose strength is well known from previous ice studies. These data may
be used to determine ice abundances from observed near-IR spectra of
interstellar and planetary materials or to predict the sizes of near-IR
features in spectral searches for these molecules in astrophysical
environments.",2005-02-16T21:30:14Z
"The Konus-Wind and Helicon-Coronas-F detection of the giant $γ$-ray
  flare from the soft $γ$-ray repeater SGR 1806-20","The giant outburst from SGR 1806-20 was observed on 2004 December 27 by many
spacecraft. This extremely rare event exhibits a striking similarity to the two
giant outbursts thus far observed, on 1979 March 5 from SGR 0526-66 and 1998
August 27 from SGR 1900+14. All the three outbursts start with a short giant
radiation pulse followed by a weaker tail. The tail pulsates with the period of
neutron star rotation of $\sim$5--8 s, to decay finally in a few minutes. The
enormous intensity of the initial pulse proved to be far above the saturation
level of the gamma-ray detectors, with the result that the most valuable data
on the time structure and energy spectrum of the pulse is lost. At the time of
the December 27 outburst, a Russian spacecraft Coronas-F with a $\gamma$-ray
spectrometer aboard was occulted by the Earth and could not see the outburst.
It succeeded, however, in observing a weak reflected signal due to the
$\gamma$-rays Compton scattered by the Moon. This has been the first
observation of a cosmic gamma-ray flare reflected from a celestial body. Here
we report, that the detection of a weakened back-scattered initial pulse
combined with direct observations by the Konus $\gamma$-ray spectrometer on the
Wind spacecraft permitted us to reliably reconstruct the intensity, time
history, and energy spectra of the outburst.",2005-02-25T16:13:35Z
"Simulating the High Energy Gamma-ray sky seen by the GLAST Large Area
  Telescope","This paper presents the simulation of the GLAST high energy gamma-ray
telescope. The simulation package, written in C++, is based on the Geant4

A detailed simulation of the electronic signals inside Silicon detectors has
been provided and it is used for the particle tracking, which is handled by a
dedicated software. A unique repository for the geometrical description of the
detector has been realized using the XML language and a C++ library to access

outlines the contribution developed by the Italian GLAST software group.",2005-03-24T15:42:54Z
Scaling of Multi-Tension Cosmic Superstring Networks,"Brane inflation in superstring theory ends when branes collide, initiating
the hot big bang. Cosmic superstrings are produced during the brane collision.
The cosmic superstrings produced in a D3-brane-antibrane inflationary scenario
have a spectrum: $(p,q)$ bound states of $p$ fundamental (F) strings and $q$
D-strings, where $p$ and $q$ are coprime. By extending the velocity-dependent
one-scale network evolution equations for abelian Higgs cosmic strings to allow
a spectrum of string tensions, we construct a coupled (infinite) set of
equations for strings that interact through binding and self-interactions. We
apply this model to a network of $(p,q)$ superstrings. Our numerical solutions
show that $(p,q)$ networks rapidly approach a stable scaling solution. We also
extract the relative densities of each string type from our solutions.
Typically, only a small number of the lowest tension states are populated
substantially once scaling is reached. The model we study also has an
interesting new feature: the energy released in $(p,q)$ string binding is by
itself adequate to allow the network to reach scaling. This result suggests
that the scaling solution is robust. To demonstrate that this result is not
trivial, we show that choosing a different form for string interactions can
lead to network frustration.",2005-03-23T17:19:22Z
"The X-ray Emissions from the M87 Jet: Diagnostics and Physical
  Interpretation","We reanalyze the deep Chandra observations of the M87 jet, first examined by
Wilson & Yang (2002). By employing an analysis chain that includes image
deconvolution, knots HST-1 and I are fully separated from adjacent emission. We
find slight but significant variations in the spectral shape, with values of
$\alpha_x$ ranging from $\sim 1.2-1.6$. We use VLA radio observations, as well
as HST imaging and polarimetry data, to examine the jet's broad-band spectrum
and inquire as to the nature of particle acceleration in the jet. As shown in
previous papers, a simple continuous injection model for synchrotron-emitting
knots, in which both the filling factor, $f_{acc}$, of regions within which
particles are accelerated and the energy spectrum of the injected particles are
constant, cannot account for the X-ray flux or spectrum. Instead, we propose
that $f_{acc}$ is a function of position and energy and find that in the inner
jet, $f_{acc} \propto E_\gamma^{-0.4 \pm 0.2} \propto E_e^{-0.2 \pm 0.1}$, and
in knots A and B, $f_{acc} \propto E_\gamma^{-0.7 \pm 0.2} \propto E_e^{-0.35
\pm 0.1}$, where $E_\gamma$ is the emitted photon energy and and $E_e$ is the
emitting electron energy. In this model, the index $p$ of the injected electron
energy spectrum ($n(E_{e}) \propto E_{e}^{-p}$) is $p=2.2$ at all locations in
the jet, as predicted by models of cosmic ray acceleration by ultrarelativistic
shocks. There is a strong correlation between the peaks of X-ray emission and
minima of optical percentage polarization, i.e., regions where the jet magnetic
field is not ordered. We suggest that the X-ray peaks coincide with shock waves
which accelerate the X-ray emitting electrons and cause changes in the
direction of the magnetic field; the polarization is thus small because of beam
averaging.",2005-03-01T19:15:42Z
"Nonsingular density profiles of dark matter halos and Strong
  gravitational lensing","We use the statistics of strong gravitational lenses to investigate whether
mass profiles with a flat density core are supported. The probability for
lensing by halos modeled by a nonsingular truncated isothermal sphere (NTIS)
with image separations greater than a certain value (ranging from zero to ten
arcseconds) is calculated. NTIS is an analytical model for the postcollapse
equilibrium structure of virialized objects derived by Shapiro, Iliev & Raga.
This profile has a soft core and matches quite well with the mass profiles of
dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxies deduced from their observed rotation
curves. It also agrees well with the NFW (Navarro-Frenk-White) profile at all
radii outside of a few NTIS core radii. Unfortunately, comparing the results
with those for singular lensing halos (NFW and SIS+NFW) and strong lensing
observations, the probabilities for lensing by NTIS halos are far too low. As
this result is valid for any other nonsingular density profiles (with a large
core radius), we conclude that nonsingular density profiles (with a large core
radius) for CDM halos are ruled out by statistics of strong gravitational
lenses.",2005-02-05T04:50:03Z
A deep survey of brown dwarfs in Orion with Gemini,"We report the results of a deep near infrared (JHK) survey of the outer parts
of the Trapezium Cluster with Gemini South/Flamingos. 396 sources were detected
in a 26 arcmin^2 area, including 138 brown dwarf candidates, defined as M<0.075
Msun for an assumed age of 1 Myr. Only 33 of the brown dwarf candidates are
planetary mass candidates (PMCs) with estimated masses in the range
0.003<M<0.012Msun. In an extinction limited sample (A(V)<5) complete to
approximately 0.005 Msun (5 Mjup) the mass function appears to drop by a factor
of 2 at the deuterium burning threshold, i.e. at planetary masses. After
allowing for background contamination it is likely that planetary mass objects
at 3-13 Mjup number <10% of the cluster population, with an upper limit of 13%.
Analysis of the spatial distribution of stars and brown dwarf candidates
suggests that brown dwarfs and very low mass stars (M<0.1 Msun) are less likely
than more massive stars to have wide (>150 AU) binary companions. This result
has modest statistical significance (96%) in our data but is supported at 93%
confidence by analysis of an completely independent sample taken from the
Subaru data of Kaifu et al.(2000). There is a statistically very significant
excess of both stars and brown dwarfs with small separations from each other
(<6 arcsec or 2600 AU). This appears to be due to the presence of small N
subgroups, which are likely to be dynamically unstable in the long term. Hence
these results are consistent with the 'ejected stellar embryo' hypothesis for
brown dwarf formation (Reipurth & Clarke 2001). We also report the discovery of
two new bipolar nebulae, which are interpreted as Class I protostars.",2005-04-26T16:31:51Z
"Using the ROSAT Bright Source Catalogue to find Counterparts for
  IBIS/ISGRI Survey Sources","The IBIS/ISGRI first year galactic plane survey has produced a catalogue
containing 123 hard X-ray sources visible down to a flux limit of a few
milliCrabs. The point source location accuracy of typically 1-3 arcminutes has
allowed the counterparts for 95 of these sources to be found at other
wavelengths. In order to identify the remaining 28 objects, we have
cross-correlated the ISGRI catalogue with the ROSAT All Sky Survey Bright
Source Catalogue. In this way, for ISGRI sources which have a counterpart in
soft X-rays, we can use the, much smaller, ROSAT error box to search for
identifications. As expected, we find a strong correlation between the two
catalogues and calculate that there are 75 associations with the number
expected by chance to be almost zero. Of these 75 sources, ten are in the list
of unidentified objects. Using the ROSAT error boxes we provide tentative
associations for 8 of these.",2005-02-08T09:48:00Z
A Chandra View of the Anomalous Half-Merger NGC520,"(abridged) High spatial and spectral resolution Chandra X-ray observations of
the anomalous merging galaxy NGC520, a similarly-evolved system to the
well-known Antennae galaxies, are presented here. Of great interest is the fact
that NGC520, on account of it being due to the result of an encounter between
one gas-rich disk and one gas-poor disk, appears in X-rays to be only 'half a
merger'; Whereas a ULX lies at the primary (SE), more-massive nucleus, no
sources are seen at the secondary nucleus. Whereas what appears to be a
starburst-driven galactic wind is seen outflowing perpendicular to the
molecular disk surrounding the primary nucleus, no such diffuse structure is
seen anywhere near the secondary nucleus. Comparing the X-ray properties with
those of other merging galaxies, one sees that, relative to its SFR, the number
of ULXs seen within the system is rather small. Similarly the total X-ray
luminosity and the fraction of this emission that appears diffuse are both a
factor ~2 less than that expected based on NGC520's evolutionary merger stage.
15 X-ray sources are detected within the system, including a small number of
bright ULXs that flatten the source XLF to a level similar to that of the
Antennae and other mergers. Lastly, to see what appears to be a
starburst-driven diffuse galactic wind, with a spectrum entirely consistent
with that of other known galactic winds, though unusually, emanating from only
one of the nuclei, is a surprise, given that one might have expected such
structures to have distorted very quickly in such a rapidly evolving
environment. The wind is larger and more massive than features seen in
evolutionarily earlier systems (eg the Mice), but smaller and less massive than
as seen in later systems (eg the Antennae), or classic starbursts.",2005-02-23T17:09:02Z
Detection of Ne VIII in the Low-Redshift Warm-Hot IGM,"High resolution FUSE and STIS observations of the bright QSO HE 0226-4110
(zem = 0.495) reveal the presence of a multi-phase absorption line system at
zabs(O VI) = 0.20701 containing absorption from H I (Ly alpha to Ly theta), C
III, O III, O IV, O VI, N III, Ne VIII, Si III, S VI and possibly S V. Single
component fits to the Ne VIII and O VI absorption doublets yield logN(Ne VIII)
= 13.89+/-0.11 and logN(O VI) = 14.37+/-0.03. The Ne VIII and O VI doublets are
detected at 3.9 sigma and 16 sigma significance levels, respectively. This
represents the first detection of intergalactic Ne VIII, a diagnostic of gas
with temperature in the range from 5x10(5) to 1x10(6) K. The O VI and Ne VIII
are not likely created in a low density medium photoionized solely by the
extragalactic background at z = 0.2 since the required path length of ~11 Mpc
implies the Hubble flow absorption line broadening would be ~10 times greater
than the observed line widths. A collisional ionization origin is therefore
more likely. Assuming [Ne/H] and [O/H] = -0.5, the value N(Ne VIII)/N(O VI) =
0.33+/-0.10 is consistent with gas in collisional ionization equilibrium near
T=5.4x10(5) K with logN(H)= 19.9 and N(H)/N(H I) = 1.7x10(6). The observations
support the basic idea that a substantial fraction of the baryonic matter at
low redshift exists in hot very highly ionized gaseous structures.",2005-03-02T20:42:28Z
Observational Gamma-ray Cosmology,"We discuss how measurements of the absorption of gamma-rays from GeV to TeV
energies via pair production on the extragalactic background light (EBL) can
probe important issues in galaxy formation. Semi-analytic models (SAMs) of
galaxy formation, based on the flat LCDM hierarchical structure formation
scenario, are used to make predictions of the EBL from 0.1 to 1000 microns.
SAMs incorporate simplified physical treatments of the key processes of galaxy
formation -- including gravitational collapse and merging of dark matter halos,
gas cooling and dissipation, star formation, supernova feedback and metal
production. We will summarize SAM successes and failures in accounting for
observations at low and high redshift. New ground- and space-based gamma ray
telescopes will help to determine the EBL, and also help to explain its origin
by constraining some of the most uncertain features of galaxy formation theory,
including the stellar initial mass function, the history of star formation, and
the reprocessing of light by dust. On a separate topic concerning gamma ray
cosmology, we discuss a new theoretical insight into the distribution of dark
matter at the center of the Milky Way, and its implications concerning the high
energy gamma rays observed from the Galactic center.",2005-02-09T20:08:30Z
On MHD jet production in the collapsing and rotating envelope,"We present results from axisymmetric, time-dependent hydrodynamical (HD) and
magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of a gaseous envelope collapsing onto a
black hole (BH). We consider gas with so small angular momentum that after an
initial transient, the flow in the HD case, accretes directly onto a BH without
forming a rotationally support torus. However, in the MHD case even with a very
weak initial magnetic field, the flow settles into a configuration with four
components: (i) an equatorial inflow, (ii) a bipolar outflow, (iii) polar
funnel outflow, and (iv) polar funnel inflow. We focus our analysis on the
second flow component of the MHD flow which represents a simple yet robust
example of a well-organized inflow/outflow solution to the problem of MHD jet
formation. The jet is heavy, highly magnetized, and driven by magnetic and
centrifugal forces. A significant fraction of the total energy in the jet is
carried out by a large scale magnetic field. We review previous simulations,
where specific angular momentum was higher than that assumed here, and conclude
that our bipolar outflow develops for a wide range of the properties of the
flow near the equator and near the poles. Future work on such a simple
inflow/outflow solution will help to pinpoint the key elements of real
jets/outflows as well as help to interpret much more complex simulations aimed
at studying jet formation and collapse of magnetized envelopes.",2005-02-24T15:19:35Z
"Spatial Correlation of Massive Black Hole Mergers: Probing the Formation
  Mechanism and Reionization","We consider the spatial clustering of massive black hole (MBH) mergers, and
discuss possible ways to use gravitational wave observations in the LISA and
DECIGO/BBO range for obtaining cosmological and cosmogonical information.
Constraints on large scale structure (LSS) and merger histories may be possible
by detections of an alignment of the GW polarization direction with principal
axes of the LSS. Constraints on the merger physics and the reionization epoch
may be obtained by GW measurements of MBH correlation lengths, in the case when
the MBH angular momentum loss occurs through gas drag. Such measurements would
provide information about the LSS and the reionization epoch, additional to and
independent of any obtained from electromagnetic signals, as well as about the
astrophysics of MBH mergers.",2005-02-21T23:08:19Z
"Quiescent Cores and the Efficiency of Turbulence-Accelerated,
  Magnetically Regulated Star Formation","The efficiency of star formation, defined as the ratio of the stellar to
total (gas and stellar) mass, is observed to vary from a few percent in regions
of dispersed star formation to about a third in cluster-forming cores. This
difference may reflect the relative importance of magnetic fields and
turbulence in controlling star formation. We investigate the interplay between
supersonic turbulence and magnetic fields using numerical simulations, in a
sheet-like geometry. We demonstrate that star formation with an efficiency of a
few percent can occur over several gravitational collapse times in moderately
magnetically subcritical clouds that are supersonically turbulent. The
turbulence accelerates star formation by reducing the time for dense core
formation. The dense cores produced are predominantly quiescent, with subsonic
internal motions. These cores tend to be moderately supercritical. They have
lifetimes long compared with their local gravitational collapse time. Some of
the cores collapse to form stars, while others disperse away without star
formation. In turbulent clouds that are marginally magnetically supercritical,
the star formation efficiency is higher, but can still be consistent with the
values inferred for nearby embedded clusters. If not regulated by magnetic
fields at all, star formation in a multi-Jeans mass cloud endowed with a strong
initial turbulence proceeds rapidly, with the majority of cloud mass converted
into stars in a gravitational collapse time. The efficiency is formally higher
than the values inferred for nearby cluster-forming cores, indicating that
magnetic fields are dynamically important even for cluster formation.",2005-02-07T06:25:58Z
"Origin of E+A galaxies: I. Physical properties of E+A's formed from
  galaxy merging and interaction","We investigate the structural, kinematical, and spectrophotometric properties
of ``E+A'' galaxies -- those with strong Balmer absorption lines but no
significant [OII] emission -- using numerical simulations combined with stellar
population synthesis codes. We particularly focus on the two-dimensional (2D)
distributions of line-of-sight velocity, velocity dispersion, colors, line
index in E+A galaxies formed via the interaction and merging of two gas-rich
spirals. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that E+A elliptical galaxies
formed by major galaxy merging have positive radial color gradients and
negative radial H$\delta$ gradients by virtue of their central poststarburst
populations. Furthermore, we show that the projected kinematical and
spectroscopic properties of the simulated E+A galaxies can be remarkably
different for different major merger models. For example, the simulated E+A
ellipticals with kinematically decoupled cores clearly show regions of strong
H$\delta$ absorption which are very flattened, with differences in rotation and
velocity dispersion between the old and young stars. E+A ellipticals are highly
likely to show more rapid rotation and a smaller central velocity dispersion in
young stars than in old ones.We also provide specific predictions on the
structural, kinematical, and spectrophotometric properties of young globular
cluster systems in E+A's. Based on these results, we discuss the importance of
spatially resolved, integral field unit spectroscopy on large (8-10m)
ground-based telescopes in confirming the formation of kinematically distinct
cores in elliptical galaxies produced via dissipative merging and determining
the most probable physical mechanism(s) for E+A formation with disky and

The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer on the International Space Station,"The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) is a particle physics detector designed
to operate on the International Space Station (ISS). The aim of AMS is the
direct detection of charged particles in the rigidity range from 0.5 GV to few
TV to perform high statistics studies of cosmic rays in space and search for
antimatter and dark matter. This will be possible because of the large
geometrical acceptance, a very accurate energy determination and a very precise
particle identification through redundant measurements of its energy, velocity
and electric charge. AMS is scheduled to be placed on the ISS at the beginning
of 2008 for a 3 year exposure.",2005-05-20T08:45:37Z
The puzzling case of GRB 990123: multiwavelength afterglow study,"We report on the BeppoSAX data analysis of the afterglow of Gamma-Ray Burst
(GRB) 990123, one of the brightest GRBs detected by BeppoSAX. Mainly due to its
exceptional brightness, this is the only source for which the Wide Field
Cameras have allowed an early detection of the X-ray afterglow between about 20
and 60 min after the GRB trigger. Besides, again for the first time,
high-energy emission from the afterglow was detected up to 60 keV. For the
X-ray afterglow we found a power-law decay with index alpha = 1.46 +/- 0.04;
the spectrum has a power-law shape with photon index Gamma about 1.9. The
backward extrapolation of the afterglow decay smoothly reconnects with the late
GRB emission, thus suggesting that both emissions are produced by the same
phenomenon. An extensive set of multiwavelength observations for the GRB 990123
afterglow made during the BeppoSAX pointing was collected from the literature.
The hard X-ray to radio range coverage allowed to construct a spectral flux
distribution and to perform an analysis of the GRB afterglow in the context of
the ""fireball"" model. We also report the results of temporal and spectral
analysis of an X-ray source serendipitously observed about 22 arcmin north of
the GRB afterglow, along with the optical spectroscopy of its possible
counterpart to establish the nature of this source.",2005-04-27T15:14:48Z
Covariant Kinetic Theory with an Application to the Coma Cluster,"In this paper, we introduce a novel solution to the covariant Landau equation
for a pure electron plasma. The method conserves energy and particle number,
and reduces smoothly to the Rosenbluth potentials of non-relativistic theory.
In addition, we find that a fully relativistic plasma equilibrates in only
1/100th of a Spitzer time--much faster than in the non-relativistic limit--a
factor of significant import to situations in which distortions to a Maxwellian
distribution are produced by anomalous methods of acceleration. To demonstrate
the power of our solution in dealing with hot, astrophysical plasmas, we use
this technique to show that one of the currently considered models--continuous
stochastic acceleration--for the hard X-ray emission in the Coma cluster
actually cannot work because the energy gained by the particles is distributed
to the {\it whole} plasma on a time scale much shorter than that of the
acceleration process itself.",2005-05-02T20:27:59Z
"Multidimensional Hydrodynamical Simulations of radiative cooling
  SNRs-clouds interactions: an application to Starburst Environments","In this work we are interested to study the by-products of SNR-clouds in a
starburst (SB) system. These interactions can have an important role in the
recycling of matter from the clouds to the ISM and vice-versa. In the present
work, we have focused our attention on the global effects of the interactions
between clouds and SN shock waves in the ISM of SB environments, and performed
3-D radiative cooling hydrodynamical simulations with the adaptive YGUAZU grid
code. We have also considered the effects of the photo-evaporation due to the
presence of a high number of UV photons from hot stars and supernovae (SNe).
The results have shown that, in the presence of radiative cooling, instead of
an efficient gas mixing with the diffuse ISM, the interactions cause the
fragmentation of the clouds into smaller ones. The results have also revealed
that the SNR-clouds interactions are less efficient at producing substantial
mass loss from the clouds to the diffuse ISM than mechanisms such as the
photo-evaporation caused by the UV flux from the hot stars.",2005-02-04T15:44:48Z
"Parker Instability in a Self-Gravitating Magnetized Gas Disk: I. Linear
  Stability Analysis","To be a formation mechanism of such large-scale structures as giant molecular
clouds (GMCs) and HI superclouds, the classical Parker instability driven by
external gravity has to overcome three major obstacles: The convective motion
accompanying the instability generates thin sheets than large condensations.
The degree of density enhancement achieved by the instability is too low to
make dense interstellar clouds. The time and the length scales of the
instability are significantly longer and larger than the estimated formation
time and the observed mean separation of the GMCs, respectively. This paper
examines whether a replacement of the driving agent from the external to the
self gravity might remove these obstacles by activating the gravitational
instability in the Galactic ISM disk. The self gravity can suppress the
convective motions, and a cooperative action of the Jeans and the Parker
instabilities can remove all the obstacles confronting the classical version of
the Parker instability. The mass and mean separation of the structures
resulting from the odd-parity undular mode solution are shown to agree better
with the HI superclouds than with the GMCs. We briefly discuss how inclusions
of the external gravity and cosmic rays would modify behaviors of the
odd-parity undular mode solution.",2005-03-01T09:52:48Z
"Discovery of extended VHE gamma-ray emission from the asymmetric pulsar
  wind nebula in MSH 15-52 with H.E.S.S","The Supernova Remnant MSH 15-52 has been observed in very high energy (VHE)
gamma-rays using the H.E.S.S. 4-telescope array located in Namibia. A gamma-ray
signal is detected at the 25 sigma level during an exposure of 22.1 hours live
time. The image reveals an elliptically shaped emission region around the
pulsar PSR B1509-58, with semi-major axis 6' in the NW-SE direction and
semi-minor axis 2' approximately. This morphology coincides with the diffuse
pulsar wind nebula as observed at X-ray energies by ROSAT. The overall energy
spectrum from 280 GeV up to 40 TeV can be fitted by a power law with photon
index Gamma = 2.27 +/- 0.03(stat.) +/- 0.20(syst.). The detected emission can
be plausibly explained by inverse Compton scattering of accelerated
relativistic electrons with soft photons.",2005-04-05T17:53:15Z
The disk vanishes,"Recently published observations of VY Scl stars in their low,
long-intermediate and high states confirm our model (Hameury & Lasota 2002)
according to which accretion disks in such systems must vanish when their
temperature corresponds to thermally unstable configurations. An observational
confirmation of the hypothesis that the disk disappearance is caused by
magnetic effects would have important consequences for cataclysmic variable
evolution models.",2005-06-16T14:08:19Z
Search templates for stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds,"Several earth-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors are actively pursuing
the quest for placing observational constraints on models that predict the
behavior of a variety of astrophysical and cosmological sources. These sources
span a wide gamut, ranging from hydrodynamic instabilities in neutron stars
(such as r-modes) to particle production in the early universe. Signals from a
subset of these sources are expected to appear in these detectors as stochastic
GW backgrounds (SGWBs). The detection of these backgrounds will help us in
characterizing their sources. Accounting for such a background will also be
required by some detectors, such as the proposed space-based detector LISA, so
that they can detect other GW signals. Here, we formulate the problem of
constructing a bank of search templates that discretely span the parameter
space of a generic SGWB. We apply it to the specific case of a class of
cosmological SGWBs, known as the broken power-law models. We derive how the
template density varies in their three-dimensional parameter space and show
that for the LIGO 4km detector pair, with LIGO-I sensitivities, about a few
hundred templates will suffice to detect such a background while incurring a
loss in signal-to-noise ratio of no more than 3%.",2005-04-02T23:41:15Z
Molecular Gas and Nuclear Activity in Radio Galaxies Detected by IRAS,"This paper reports the latest results from a millimeter-wave (CO)
spectroscopic survey of IRAS-detected radio galaxies with L_1.4GHz ~ 10^23-28
W/Hz in the redshift range z ~ 0.02-0.15. The IRAS flux-limited sample contains
33 radio galaxies with different radio morphologies and a broad range of
infrared luminosities L_IR = 10^9-12 L_sun), allowing for an investigation of
(a) whether low-z radio-selected AGN reside in molecular gas-rich host galaxes,
and (b) whether the CO properties are correlated with the properties of the
host galaxy or the AGN. All of the radio galaxies in Mazzarella et al. (1993)
and Mirabel et al. (1989) have been reobserved. Three new CO detections have
been made, raising the total number of CO detections to nine and setting the
survey detection rate at ~ 25%. Many of the CO lines have double-peaked
profiles, and the CO line widths are broad (average Delta v_FWHM ~ 500+/-130
km/s), exceeding the average CO widths of both ultraluminous infrared galaxies
(300+/-90 km/s) and Palomar-Green QSOs (260+/-160 km/s), and thus being
indicative of massive host galaxies. The CO luminosities translate into
molecular gas masses of ~ 0.4-7x10^9 M_sun, however, the 3-sigma CO upper
limits for nondetections do not rule out a molecular gas mass as high as that
of the Milky Way (~ 3x10^9 M_sun). Optical images of eight out of nine
molecular gas-rich radio galaxies show evidence of close companions and/or
tidal features. Finally, there is no obvious correlation between radio power
and molecular gas mass. However, it is notable that only one F-R II galaxy out
of 12 is detected in this CO survey; the remaining detections are of galaxies
hosting F-R I and compact radio jets.",2005-04-27T15:19:00Z
"The nature of Composite Seyfert/Star-forming galaxies revealed by X-ray
  observations","This paper presents new Chandra and BeppoSAX observations aimed at
investigating the optical/X-ray mismatch in the enigmatic class of the
Composite galaxies, discovered by a cross-correlation of IRAS and ROSAT all sky
survey catalogues. These galaxies have been classified as star-forming objects
on the basis of their optical spectra, while the detection of weak broad wings
in the H(alpha) emission in a few of them and their high X-ray luminosity in
the ROSAT band indicated the presence of an active nucleus. The analysis of
Chandra observations for 4 Composites has revealed nuclear point-like sources,
with a typical AGN spectrum (Gamma = 1.7-1.9) and little intrinsic absorption.
A strong flux variability has been observed on different time scales, in
particular most of the sources were brighter at the ROSAT epoch. Although of
relative low luminosity for the AGN class (L(2-10 keV) = 3-60 x 10^{41} erg/s),
the active nucleus is nevertheless dominant in the X-ray domain. At other
wavelengths it appears to be overwhelmed by the starburst and/or host galaxy
light, yielding the Composite classification for these objects.",2005-06-06T13:13:40Z
"UVBLUE: a new high-resolution theoretical library of ultraviolet stellar
  spectra","We present an extended ultraviolet-blue (850-4700 AA) library of theoretical
stellar spectral energy distributions (SEDs) computed at high resolution, R=
50,000. The UVBLUE grid, as we named the library, is based on LTE calculations
carried out with ATLAS9 and SYNTHE codes developed by R. L. Kurucz and consists
of nearly 1800 entries that cover a large volume of the parameter space. It
spans a range in effective temperature from 3000 to 50,000 K, the surface
gravity ranges from log g= 0.0 to 5.0 with a step of 0.5 dex, while seven
chemical compositions are considered: [Fe/H]= -2.0, -1.5, -1.0, -0.5, +0.0,
+0.3 and +0.5 dex. For its coverage across the H-R diagram, this library is the
most comprehensive one ever computed at high resolution in the short-wavelength
spectral range, and useful application can be foreseen both for the study of
single stars and in population synthesis models of galaxies and other stellar
systems.",2005-04-13T20:14:40Z
Pulsation properties of C stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud,"A sample of carbon-rich stars (C-stars) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)
was selected from the combined 2MASS and DENIS catalogues on the basis of their
$J-K_s$ colour. This sample was extended to include confirmed C--stars from the
Rebeirot et al. (1993) spectroscopic atlas. In this combined sample (N = 1152),
a smaller number (N = 1079) were found to have MACHO observations. For this
sub--sample, light curves were determined and 919 stars were found to have high
quality light-curves with amplitudes of at least 0.05 mag. Of these stars, only
4% have a well--defined single period -- most of these have multiple
well-defined periods, while 15% have highly irregular light--curves. The
distribution of the logarithm of the period versus magnitude, colour, period
ratio (if applicable), and amplitude was analyzed and compared with previous
works. Variable C-stars are distributed in three sequences: B, C and D from
Wood et al. (1999), and do not populate sequences with periods shorter than
$\log P \sim 1.5$. Stellar ages and masses were estimated using stellar
evolutionary models.",2005-03-25T10:28:40Z
On the Rotation Period of (90377) Sedna,"We present precise, ~1%, r-band relative photometry of the unusual solar
system object (90377) Sedna. Our data consist of 143 data points taken over
eight nights in October 2004 and January 2005. The RMS variability over the
longest contiguous stretch of five nights of data spanning nine days is only
1.3%. This subset of data alone constrain the amplitude of any long-period
variations with period P to be A<1% (P/20 days)^2. Over the course of any given
5-hour segment, the data exhibits significant linear trends not seen in a
comparison star of similar magnitude, and in a few cases these segments show
clear evidence for curvature at the level of a few millimagnitudes per hour^2.
These properties imply that the rotation period of Sedna is O(10 hours), cannot
be < 5 hours, and cannot be >10 days, unless the intrinsic light curve has
significant and comparable power on multiple timescales, which is unlikely. A
sinusoidal fit yields a period of P=(10.273 +/- 0.002) hours and semi-amplitude
of A=(1.1 +/- 0.1)%. There are additional acceptable fits with flanking periods
separated by ~3 minutes, as well as another class of fits with P ~ 18 hours,
although these later fits appear less viable based on visual inspection. Our
results indicate that the period of Sedna is likely consistent with typical
rotation periods of solar system objects, thus obviating the need for a massive
companion to slow its rotation.",2005-03-30T21:56:58Z
Discovery of a massive SCUBA core with both inflow and outflow motions,"We report the discovery of a massive SCUBA core with evidence of inflow and
outflow motions. This core is detected by SCUBA at both 450 and 850 micro
meter. Barely resolved by the telescope beam at 450 micro meter, it has a size
of 10 arcsec, corresponding to 0.28 pc at a distance of 5.7 kpc. The dust
temperature is estimated to be less than 29 K, the total mass is 820 solar mass
and the average density is 1.1e-6 per cube-cm in a region with a radius of 5
arcsec. Follow-up spectral line observations, including HCN (3-2), HCO+ (3-2),
H13CO+ (3-2) and C17O (2-1) reveal a typical blue profile which indicates that
this core is collapsing. The CO (3-2) line profile is as broad as 38 km/s,
indicating outflow motions in this region. This core is approximately 1.5 pc
away from the known HII region G25.4NW, but there are no obvious radio, IRAS,
MSX or Spitzer sources associated with it. We suggest that this core is at a
very early stage of massive star or cluster formation.",2005-06-10T06:06:00Z
Cluster Populations in Abell 2125 and 2218,"We combine new narrow band photometry with archival WFPC2 data for A2218
($z$=0.18) and A2125 ($z$=0.25), two clusters with intermediate redshifts but
very different cluster properties, in order to examine the evolution of galaxy
populations. A2218 is a dense, elliptical-rich cluster (Bautz-Morgan type II)
similar to Coma in its evolutionary appearance; whereas, A2125 is a less dense,
more open cluster (Bautz-Morgan type II-III), although similar in richness to
A2218. The color-magnitude relation indicates that A2125 has a more developed
blue population than A2218 (the Butcher-Oemler effect), although both clusters
have significant numbers of blue galaxies (ranging in star formation rates from
normal, star-forming disks to starburst systems) as compared to a present-day
cluster. The colors of the red populations are identical in A2125 and A2218 and
well fit by passive evolution models. We are able, for the first time, to
combine archived WFPC2 images with our narrow band photometry for a color,
morphological and structural analysis of the blue Butcher-Oemler population. We
find the blue population to composed of two sub-populations, a bright, spiral
population and a fainter, dwarf starburst population. A2125 is richer in bright
starburst systems, apparently induced by the cluster's younger dynamical state.
In addition, a majority of the S0 population in A2125 and A2218 is composed of
bulge+disk systems, whereas, nearby clusters such as Coma are composed
primarily of lenticulars (pure disk S0's). The structural parameters of the S0
bulges in A2125/A2218 are identical to the structure parameters of cluster
ellipticals suggesting that the disks of some S0's in intermediate redshift
clusters are stripped away with the leftover bulges evolving into present-day
ellipticals.",2005-06-08T23:26:16Z
Galactic Winds,"Galactic winds are the primary mechanism by which energy and metals are
recycled in galaxies and are deposited into the intergalactic medium. New
observations are revealing the ubiquity of this process, particularly at high
redshift. We describe the physics behind these winds, discuss the observational
evidence for them in nearby star-forming and active galaxies and in the
high-redshift universe, and consider the implications of energetic winds for
the formation and evolution of galaxies and the intergalactic medium. To
inspire future research, we conclude with a set of observational and
theoretical challenges.",2005-04-20T17:29:58Z
"A possible new interpretation of the results of $Δα/α$
  from QSO absorption lines","The measurement of $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ from the QSO absorption lines of
Fe_II taken at two different redshifts (Quast et al, Levshakov et al) is
compared with the result based on the 23 data points also obtained from
VLT/UVES (Chand et al), to demonstrate that the apparent oscillatory
time-dependence fitting the latter taken at face value is reinforced by the
former claimed to be of much better accuracy.",2005-02-09T15:40:50Z
Dynamical One-Armed Spiral Instability in Differentially Rotating Stars,"We investigate the dynamical one-armed spiral instability in differentially
rotating stars with both eigenmode analysis and hydrodynamic simulations in
Newtonian gravity. We find that the one-armed spiral mode is generated around
the corotation radius of the star, and the distribution of angular momentum
shifts inwards the corotation radius during the growth of one-armed spiral
mode. We also find by investigating the distribution of the canonical angular
momentum density that the low T/|W| dynamical instability for both m=1 and m=2
mode, where T is the rotational kinetic energy and W is the gravitational
potential energy, is generated around the corotation point. Finally, we discuss
the feature of gravitational waves generated from these modes.",2005-03-31T21:22:53Z
Disc radius variations in binaries,"A thermal/viscous instability of the accretion disc arising when hydrogen is
partially ionized is the most popular explanation of the outbursts of both
dwarf novae (DN) and soft X-ray transients (SXT). During an outburst, the disc
expands and may reach the 3:1 resonance radius, triggering the so-called tidal
instability. The consequences of such an instability are still debated; it is
generally accepted that it results in the observed periodic modulation in SU
UMa systems, and to large amplitude outbursts in these systems, the latter
being more controversial. We discuss both the theoretical and observational
evidences for such radius variations in DNs and SXTs, and the consequences of
the application of the tidal instability in SXT.",2005-06-14T05:49:05Z
"Inflationary Cosmology: Exploring the Universe from the Smallest to the
  Largest Scales","Understanding the behavior of the universe at large depends critically on
insights about the smallest units of matter and their fundamental interactions.
Inflationary cosmology is a highly successful framework for exploring these
interconnections between particle physics and gravitation. Inflation makes
several predictions about the present state of the universe -- such as its
overall shape, large-scale smoothness, and smaller-scale structure -- which are
being tested to unprecedented accuracy by a new generation of astronomical
measurements. The agreement between these predictions and the latest

"Bipolar jets growth and decline in Hen 3-1341: a direct link to fast
  wind and outburst evolution","The appearance and disappearance of collimated bipolar jets in the symbiotic
star Hen 3-1341 is reported and investigated. From modeling of the emission
line spectrum it turns out that the accreting white dwarf in quiescence has
T_WD ~ 1.2 10(5) K and R_WD ~ 0.14 Rsun, for a luminosity of 3.8 10(3) Lsun,
and it is stably burning hydrogen on the surface at a rate of 5 10(-8) Msun/yr,
feeding ionizing photons to a radiation bounded circumstellar nebula extending
for ~ 17 AU. The WD underwent a multi-maxima outburst lasting from 1998 to 2004
during which its H-burning envelope reacted to a probable small increase in the
mass accretion by expanding and cooling to T_eff ~ 1 10(4) K and R ~ 20 Rsun,
mimicking an A-type giant that radiated a total of 6 10(44) erg during the
outburst, at an average rate of 1 10(3) Lsun. Bipolar jets developed at the
time of outburst maximum and their strength declined in parallel with the
demise of a fast wind from the WD, finally disappearing when the wind stopped
halfway to quiescence, marking a 1:1 correspondence between jets presence and
feeding action of the fast wind. The total mass in the jets was M_jet ~ 2.5
10(-7) Msun for a kinetic energy of E_jet ~ 1.7 10(42)/(sin i) erg,
corresponding to 0.3/(sin i) percent of the energy radiated during the whole
outburst.",2005-02-03T11:19:46Z
"Spitzer Observations of Optically ""Invisible"" Radio and X-Ray Sources:
  High Redshift AGN","We have combined a survey at 24 microns to 0.3 mJy with the Multiband Imaging
Photometer (MIPS) on the Spitzer Space Telescope, a 20 cm A-array VLA survey
covering 0.5 deg^2, and an existing 172 ks Chandra X-Ray Observatory exposure
to investigate the nature of optically faint radio and X-ray sources in the
NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey (NDWFS) in Bootes. We find little overlap between
the radio and infrared selected populations: only 9% of the infrared sources
are detected in the radio and only 33% of the radio sources are detected in the
infrared. Thirty-six (10%) of the 377 compact radio sources lack optical
counterparts in the NDWFS Bw, R, & I images. We refer to these objects as
optically invisible radio sources (OIRS). Only four of the thirty-one OIRSs
observed with MIPS are detected at 24 microns. Comparisons of the radio and
infrared properties of the OIRSs with various galaxy spectral energy
distributions demonstrate that most of these sources are powered by AGN rather
than starbursts. Similarly, eleven X-ray sources observed by both MIPS and the
VLA are classified as optically invisible X-ray sources (OIXS). None are
detected at 24 microns or 20 cm. All seven OIXSs detected in Chandra's 0.5-2
keV band have infrared to X-ray flux ratios consistent with their luminosity
being dominated by an unobscured AGN. From these results we conclude that both
the optically invisible radio and X-ray source populations are primarily AGN,
relatively unaffected by dust and most likely at z > 1. No OIRSs are detected
in X-ray emission and no OIXSs are detected at 20 cm. However, given the wide
range in radio and X-ray properties of known AGN and the size of our samples,
this lack of overlap does not necessarily imply AGN source populations.",2005-02-07T17:04:52Z
"Gravitational waves, inflation and the cosmic microwave background:
  towards testing the slow-roll paradigm","One of the fundamental and yet untested predictions of inflationary models is
the generation of a very weak cosmic background of gravitational radiation. We
investigate the sensitivity required for a space-based gravitational wave laser
interferometer with peak sensitivity at $\sim 1$ Hz to observe such signal as a
function of the model parameters and compare it with indirect limits that can
be set with data from present and future cosmic microwave background missions.
We concentrate on signals predicted by slow-roll single field inflationary
models and instrumental configurations such as those proposed for the LISA

"Magnetic White Dwarfs from the SDSS II. The Second and Third Data
  Releases","Fifty-two magnetic white dwarfs have been identified in spectroscopic
observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) obtained between mid-2002
and the end of 2004, including Data Releases 2 and 3. Though not as numerous
nor as diverse as the discoveries from the first Data Release, the collection
exhibits polar field strengths ranging from 1.5MG to ~1000MG, and includes two
new unusual atomic DQA examples, a molecular DQ, and five stars that show
hydrogen in fields above 500MG. The highest-field example, SDSSJ2346+3853, may
be the most strongly magnetic white dwarf yet discovered. Analysis of the
photometric data indicates that the magnetic sample spans the same temperature
range as for nonmagnetic white dwarfs from the SDSS, and support is found for
previous claims that magnetic white dwarfs tend to have larger masses than
their nonmagnetic counterparts. A glaring exception to this trend is the
apparently low-gravity object SDSSJ0933+1022, which may have a history
involving a close binary companion.",2005-05-04T23:36:41Z
Deuterated H$_3^+$ in proto-planetary disks,"Probing the gas and dust in proto-planetary disks is central for
understanding the process of planet formation. In disks surrounding solar type
protostars, the bulk of the disk mass resides in the outer midplane, which is
cold ($\leq$20 K), dense ($\geq 10^7$ cm$^{-3}$) and depleted of CO. Observing
the disk midplane has proved, therefore, to be a formidable challenge.
Ceccarelli et al. (2004) detected H$_2$D$^+$ emission in a proto-planetary disk
and claimed that it probes the midplane gas. Indeed, since all heavy-elements
bearing molecules condense out onto the grain mantles, the most abundant ions
in the disk midplane are predicted to be H$_3^+$ and its isotopomers. In this
article, we carry out a theoretical study of the chemical structure of the
outer midplane of proto-planetary disks. Using a self-consistent physical model
for the flaring disk structure, we compute the abundances of H$_3^+$ and its
deuterated forms across the disk midplane. We also provide the average column
densities across the disk of H$_3^+$, H$_2$D$^+$, HD$_2^+$ and D$_3^+$, and
line intensities of the ground transitions of the ortho and para forms of
H$_2$D$^+$ and HD$_2^+$ respectively. We discuss how the results depend on the
cosmic ray ionization rate, dust-to-gas ratio and average grain radius, and
general stellar/disk parameters. An important factor is the poorly understood
freeze-out of N$_2$ molecules onto grains, which we investigate in depth. We
finally summarize the diagnostic values of observations of the H$_3^+$
isotopomers.",2005-06-11T09:01:42Z
Investigation of the rapid magnetic field variability in gamma Equ,"We investigated magnetic variability of the roAp star gamma Equ (HD 201601)
with high time resolution. Measurements of the stellar longitudinal magnetic
field B_e were performed with the hydrogen line polarimeter and the 6-m optical
telescope of Special Astrophysical Observatory on 20/21 August 1989. We
obtained a single 3-hour series of 1720 rapid B_e measurements for this star
with the average time resolution of 6.6 sec. The averaged value of <B_e> on
this night equals -750 \pm 22 G. Both the power spectrum and the amplitude
spectrum of the B_e time series essentially are flat. However, they show the
presence of a marginally significant magnetic period at P_B = 3.596 min. which
is real with the probability 67 %. The amplitude of the magnetic field
variations with this period equals 347 \pm 31 G. We did not detect variations
of B_e field in gamma Equ with the well-known photometric period, P_phot=12.44

sample of O-type supergiants. We used the Temporal Variance Spectrum (TVS)
analysis, developed by Fullerton et al 1996 and modified by us to take into
account the effects of wind emission. By means of a comparative analysis we put
a number of constraints on the properties of the variability as a function of
stellar and wind parameters. The results of our analysis show that all the
stars in the sample show evidence of significant lpv in H-alpha, mostly
dominated by processes in the wind. The variations occur between zero and 0.3
v_inf (i.e., below ~1.5 R_star), in good agreement with the results from
similar studies. A comparison between observations and line-profile simulations
indicates that for stars with intermediate wind densities the H-alpha
variability can be explained by simple models, consisting of coherent or broken
shells (blobs) uniformly distributed over the wind volume, with an intrinsic
scatter in the maximum density contrast of about a factor of two. For stars at
lower and higher wind densities, on the other hand, we found certain
inconsistencies between observations and our predictions, most importantly
concerning the mean amplitude and the symmetry properties of the TVS. This
disagreement might be explained with the presence of coherent large-scale
structures, partly confined in a volume close to the star. Interpreted in terms
of a variable mass-loss rate, the observed variations of H-alpha indicate
changes of 4% with respect to the mean value of M_dot for stars with stronger
winds and of 16% for stars with weaker winds. The effect of these variations on
the corresponding wind momenta is rather insignificant (<0.16 dex), increasing
the local scatter without affecting the Wind Momentum Luminosity Relationship.",2005-05-31T09:03:58Z
"Advances of plasma diagnostics with high-resolution spectroscopy of
  stellar coronae","X-ray emission from cool stars is an important tracer for stellar activity.
The X-ray luminosity reflects different levels of activity and covers four
orders of magnitude in stars of spectral types M-F. Low spectral resolution
provided by X-ray observations of stellar coronae in the past allowed the
determination of temperature distributions and elemental abundances making use
of atomic databases (listing line emissivities and bremsstrahlung continuum for
a given temperature structure). The new missions XMM-Newton and Chandra carry
X-ray gratings providing sufficient spectral resolution to measure the fluxes
of strategic emission lines. I describe the different approaches applicable to
low-resolution and high-resolution spectra, especially focusing on the new
grating spectra with X-ray lines. From only a few lines it is possible to
determine plasma temperatures and associated densities, to check for any
effects from resonant scattering, and to identify particular abundance
anomalies. Line-based temperature- and density measurements represent only a
fraction of the total plasma, but the pressure environment of different
fractions can be probed simply by selection of specific lines. Selected results
are presented covering all aspects of line-based analyses.",2005-04-06T11:17:01Z
A cross-calibration between Tycho-2 photometry and HST spectrophotometry,"I show that Tycho-2 photometry and HST spectrophotometry are accurate and
stable enough to obtain a precise cross-calibration by analyzing a
well-calibrated sample of 256 stars observed with both Hipparcos and HST. Based
on this analysis, I obtain the following photometric zero points in the Vega
magnitude system for Tycho-2: 0.020+-0.001 (B_T-V_T), 0.078+-0.009 (B_T), and
0.058+-0.009 (V_T).",2005-04-04T21:26:04Z
An emergent universe from a loop,"Closed, singularity-free, inflationary cosmological models have recently been
studied in the context of general relativity. Despite their appeal, these so
called emergent models suffer from a number of limitations. These include the
fact that they rely on an initial Einstein static state to describe the past
eternal phase of the universe. Given the instability of such a state within the
context of general relativity, this amounts to a very severe fine tuning. Also
in order to be able to study the dynamics of the universe within the context of
general relativity, they set the initial conditions for the universe in the
classical phase. Here we study the existence and stability of such models in
the context of Loop Quantum Cosmology and show that both these limitations can
be partially remedied, once semi-classical effects are taken into account. An
important consequence of these effects is to give rise to a static solution
(not present in GR), which dynamically is a centre equilibrium point and
located in the more natural semi-classical regime. This allows the construction
of emergent models in which the universe oscillates indefinitely about such an
initial static state. We construct an explicit emergent model of this type, in
which a non-singular past eternal oscillating universe enters a phase where the
symmetry of the oscillations is broken, leading to an emergent inflationary
epoch, while satisfying all observational and semi-classical constraints. We
also discuss emergent models in which the universe possesses both early- and
late-time accelerating phases.",2005-02-28T19:57:47Z
The Three-Dimensional Circumstellar Environment of SN 1987A,"We present the detailed construction and analysis of the most complete map to
date of the circumstellar environment around SN 1987A, using ground and
space-based imaging from the past 16 years. PSF-matched difference-imaging
analyses of data from 1988 through 1997 reveal material between 1 and 28 ly
from the SN. Careful analyses allows the reconstruction of the probable
circumstellar environment, revealing a richly-structured bipolar nebula. An
outer, double-lobed ``Peanut,'' which is believed to be the contact
discontinuity between red supergiant and main sequence winds, is a prolate
shell extending 28 ly along the poles and 11 ly near the equator. Napoleon's
Hat, previously believed to be an independent structure, is the waist of this
Peanut, which is pinched to a radius of 6 ly. Interior to this is a cylindrical
hourglass, 1 ly in radius and 4 ly long, which connects to the Peanut by a
thick equatorial disk. The nebulae are inclined 41\degr south and 8\degr east
of the line of sight, slightly elliptical in cross section, and marginally
offset west of the SN. From the hourglass to the large, bipolar lobes, echo
fluxes suggest that the gas density drops from 1--3 cm^{-3} to >0.03 cm^{-3},
while the maximum dust-grain size increases from ~0.2 micron to 2 micron, and
the Si:C dust ratio decreases. The nebulae have a total mass of ~1.7 Msun. The
geometry of the three rings is studied, suggesting the northern and southern
rings are located 1.3 and 1.0 ly from the SN, while the equatorial ring is
elliptical (b/a < 0.98), and spatially offset in the same direction as the
hourglass.",2005-02-18T20:21:09Z
Measurement of Spin-Orbit Alignment in an Extrasolar Planetary System,"We determine the stellar, planetary, and orbital properties of the transiting
planetary system HD 209458, through a joint analysis of high-precision radial
velocities, photometry, and timing of the secondary eclipse. Of primary
interest is the strong detection of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, the
alteration of photospheric line profiles that occurs because the planet occults
part of the rotating surface of the star. We develop a new technique for
modeling this effect, and use it to determine the inclination of the planetary
orbit relative to the apparent stellar equator [lambda = (-4.4 +/- 1.4)
degrees], and the line-of-sight rotation speed of the star [v*sin(I) = (4.70
+/- 0.16) km/s]. The uncertainty in these quantities has been reduced by an
order of magnitude relative to the pioneering measurements by Queloz and
collaborators. The small but nonzero misalignment is probably a relic of the
planet formation epoch, because the expected timescale for tidal
coplanarization is larger than the age of the star. Our determination of
v*sin(I) is a rare case in which rotational line broadening has been isolated
from other broadening mechanisms.",2005-04-25T19:05:25Z
"Mean JHK Magnitudes of Fundamental-Mode Cepheids from Single-Epoch
  Observations","We present an empirical method for converting single-point near-infrared J,
H, and K measurements of fundamental-mode Cepheids to mean magnitudes, using
complete light curves in V or I bands. The algorithm is based on the template
light curves in the near-infrared bandpasses. The mean uncertainty of the
method is estimated to about 0.03 mag, which is smaller than the uncertainties
obtained in other approaches to the problem in the literature.",2005-03-29T16:29:44Z
A Merger-Driven Scenario for Cosmological Disk Galaxy Formation,"(Abridged) The violent hierarchical nature of the LCDM cosmology poses
serious difficulties for the formation of disk galaxies. To help resolve these
issues, we describe a new, merger-driven scenario for the cosmological
formation of disk galaxies at high redshifts that supplements the standard
model based on dissipational collapse.In this picture, large gaseous disks may
be produced from high-angular momentum mergers of systems that are
gas-dominated, i.e. M_gas/(M_gas +M_star > 0.5 at the height of the merger.
Pressurization from the multiphase structure of the interstellar medium
prevents the complete conversion of gas into stars during the merger, and if
enough gas remains to form a disk, the remnant eventually resembles a disk
galaxy. We perform numerical simulations of galaxy mergers to study how
supernovae feedback strength, supermassive black hole growth and feedback,
progenitor gas fraction, merger mass-ratio, and orbital geometry impact the
formation of remnant disks. We find that disks can build angular momentum
through mergers and the degree of rotational support of the baryons in the
merger remnant is primarily related to feedback processes associated with star
formation. Disk-dominated remnants are restricted to form in mergers that are
gas-dominated at the time of final coalescence and gas-dominated mergers
typically require extreme progenitor gas fractions (>80%). We also show that
the formation of rotationally-supported stellar systems in mergers is not
restricted to idealized orbits, or major or minor mergers. We suggest that the
hierarchical nature of the LCDM cosmology and the physics of the interstellar
gas may act together to form spiral galaxies by building the angular momentum
of disks through early, gas-dominated mergers.",2005-03-16T21:01:18Z
The Lithium Content of the Galactic Halo Stars,"Thanks to the accurate determination of the baryon density of the universe by
the recent cosmic microwave background experiments, updated predictions of the
standard model of Big Bang nucleosynthesis now yield the initial abundance of
the primordial light elements with an unprecedented precision. In the case of
$^7$Li, the CMB+SBBN value is significantly higher than the generally reported
abundances for Pop II stars along the so-called Spite plateau. In view of the
crucial importance of this disagreement which has cosmological, galactic and
stellar implications, we decided to tackle the most critical issues of the
problem by revisiting a large sample of literature Li data in halo stars that
we assembled following some strict selection criteria on the quality of the
original analyses. [Abridged]",2005-05-12T10:11:58Z
The Near-Infrared Extinction Law in Regions of High Av,"We present a spectroscopic study of the shape of the dust-extinction law
between 1.0 and 2.2um towards a set of nine ultracompact HII regions with Av >
15 mag. We find some evidence that the reddening curve may tend to flatten at
higher extinctions, but just over half of the sample has extinction consistent
with or close to the average for the interstellar medium. There is no evidence
of extinction curves significantly steeper than the standard law, even where
water ice is present. Comparing the results to the predictions of a simple
extinction model, we suggest that a standard extinction law implies a robust
upper limit to the grain-size distribution at around 0.1 - 0.3um. Flatter
curves are most likely due to changes in this upper limit, although the effects
of flattening due to unresolved clumpy extinction cannot be ruled out.",2005-02-21T13:17:15Z
"Evidence for a Weak Galactic Center Magnetic Field from Diffuse Low
  Frequency Nonthermal Radio Emission","New low-frequency 74 and 330 MHz observations of the Galactic center (GC)
region reveal the presence of a large-scale ($6\arcdeg\times 2\arcdeg$) diffuse
source of nonthermal synchrotron emission. A minimum energy analysis of this
emission yields a total energy of $\sim (\phi^{4/7}f^{3/7})\times 10^{52}$ ergs
and a magnetic field strength of $\sim 6(\phi/f)^{2/7}$ \muG (where $\phi$ is
the proton to electron energy ratio and $f$ is the filling factor of the
synchrotron emitting gas). The equipartition particle energy density is
$1.2(\phi/f)^{2/7}$ \evcm, a value consistent with cosmic-ray data. However,
the derived magnetic field is several orders of magnitude below the 1 mG field
commonly invoked for the GC. With this field the source can be maintained with
the SN rate inferred from the GC star formation. Furthermore, a strong magnetic
field implies an abnormally low GC cosmic-ray energy density. We conclude that
the mean magnetic field in the GC region must be weak, of order 10 \muG (at
least on size scales $\ga 125\arcsec$).",2005-05-12T09:36:21Z
"The Magnetic Field of the Large Magellanic Cloud: A New Way of Studying
  Galactic Magnetism","We present a study of the Faraday rotation of extragalactic sources lying
behind the Large Magellanic Cloud. These data represent the most detailed study

demonstration of how magnetic fields in galaxies will best be studied with
future instruments.",2005-03-16T21:23:59Z
"Stochastic processes, galactic star formation, and chemical evolution.
  Effects of accretion, stripping, and collisions in multiphase multi-zone
  models","This paper reports simulations allowing for stochastic accretion and mass
loss within closed and open systems modeled using a previously developed
multi-population, multi-zone (halo, thick disk, thin disk) treatment. The star
formation rate is computed as a function of time directly from the model
equations and all chemical evolution is followed without instantaneous
recycling. Several types of simulations are presented here: (1) a closed system
with bursty mass loss from the halo to the thick disk, and from the thick to
the thin disk, in separate events to the thin disk; (2) open systems with
random environmental (extragalactic) accretion, e.g. by infall of high velocity
clouds directly to the thin disk; (3) schematic open system single and multiple
collision events and intracluster stripping. For the open models, the mass of
the Galaxy has been explicitly tracked with time. We present the evolution of
the star formation rate, metallicity histories, and concentrate on the light
elements. We find a wide range of possible outcomes, including an explanation
for variations in the Galactic D/H ratio, and highlight the problems for
uniquely reconstructing star forming histories from contemporary abundance
measurements.",2005-02-10T16:50:50Z
"A first look with Chandra at SGR 1806-20 after the Giant Flare:
  significant spectral softening and rapid flux decay","We report on the results of a ~30 ks Chandra pointing of the soft gamma-ray
repeater SGR 1806-20, the first X-ray observation with high spectral resolution
performed after the 2004 December 27 Giant Flare. The source was found in a
bursting active phase and with a significantly softer spectrum than that of the
latest observations before the Giant Flare. The observed flux in the 2-10 keV
range was ~2.2 x10^-11 erg/s/cm^2, about 20% lower than that measured three
months before the event. This indicates that, although its giant flare was ~100
times more intense than those previously observed in two other soft gamma-ray
repeaters, the post flare X-ray flux decay of SGR 1806-20 has been much faster.
The pulsed fraction was about 3%, a smaller value than that observed before the
flare. We discuss the different properties of the post-flare evolution of SGR
1806-20 in comparison to those of SGR 1900+14 and interpret the results as a
strong evidence that a magnetospheric untwisting occurred (or is occurring)
after the Giant Flare.",2005-05-10T14:33:32Z
"The Evolution of Damped Lyman-alpha Absorbers: Metallicities and Star
  Formation Rates","The damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) and sub-DLA quasar absorption lines provide
powerful probes of the evolution of metals, gas, and stars in galaxies. One
major obstacle in trying to understand the evolution of DLAs and sub-DLAs has
been the small number of metallicity measurements at z < 1.5, an epoch spanning
\~70 % of the cosmic history. In recent surveys with the Hubble Space Telescope
and Multiple Mirror Telescope, we have doubled the DLA Zn sample at z < 1.5.
Combining our results with those at higher redshifts from the literature, we
find that the global mean metallicity of DLAs does not rise to the solar value
at low redshifts. These surprising results appear to contradict the near-solar
mean metallicity observed for nearby (z ~ 0) galaxies and the predictions of
cosmic chemical evolution models based on the global star formation history.
Finally, we discuss direct constraints on the star formation rates (SFRs) in
the absorber galaxies from our deep Fabry-Perot Ly-alpha imaging study and
other emission-line studies in the literature. A large fraction of the observed
heavy-element quasar absorbers at 0 < z < 3.4 appear to have SFRs substantially
below the global mean SFR, consistent with the low metallicities observed in
the spectroscopic studies.",2005-04-26T05:46:47Z
"Tightening Constraints from the Lyman Alpha Forest with the Flux
  Probability Distribution Function","The analysis of the Lyman-alpha forest of absorption lines in quasar spectra
has emerged as a potentially powerful technique to constrain the linear matter
power spectrum. In most previous work, the amplitude of the ionizing background
was fixed by calibrating simulations to match the observed mean transmitted
flux in the Lyman-alpha forest. This procedure is undesirable in principle as
it requires the estimation of the unabsorbed quasar continuum level, a
difficult undertaking subject to various sources of systematic error and bias.
We suggest an alternative approach based on measuring the one-point probability
distribution function (pdf) of the fluctuations in the flux about the mean,
relative to the mean, i.e. the pdf of delta_f = (f - <f>)/<f>. This statistic,
while sensitive to the amplitude of the ionizing background, has the virtue
that its measurement does not require an estimate of the unabsorbed continuum
level. We present a measurement of the pdf of delta_f from seven Keck HIRES
spectra, spanning a redshift range of z = 2.2 - 4.4. To illustrate that our
method is useful, we compare our measurements of the pdf of delta_f, and
measurements of the flux power spectrum from Croft et al. (2002) at z = 2.72,
with cosmological simulations. From this comparison, we obtain constraints on
the mean transmission in the Lyman-alpha forest, the slope of the
temperature-density relation, as well as the amplitude and slope of the mass
power spectrum. Our methodology will be useful for obtaining more precise
constraints with larger data samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).",2005-05-06T21:21:40Z
Protoneutron star dynamos and pulsar magnetism,"We have investigated the turbulent mean-field dynamo action in protoneutron
stars that are subject to convective and neutron finger instabilities during
the early evolutionary phase. While the first one develops mostly in the inner
regions of the star, the second one is favored in the outer regions, where the
Rossby number is much smaller and a mean-field dynamo action is more efficient.
By solving the mean-field induction equation we have computed the critical spin
period below which no dynamo action is possible and found it to be $\sim 1$ s
for a wide range of stellar models and for both axisymmetric and
non-axisymmetric magnetic fields. Because this critical period is substantially
longer than the characteristic spin period of very young pulsars, we expect
that a mean-field dynamo will be effective for most protoneutron stars. The
saturation dipole field estimated by making use of the model of ``global''
quenching fits well the pulsar magnetic fields inferred from the spin-down
data. Apart from the large scale magnetic field, our model predicts also a
generation of small scale fields which are typically stronger than the poloidal
field and can survive during the lifetime of pulsars. Extremely rapidly
rotating protoneutron stars ($P \sim 1$ ms) may have the dipole field $\sim
(3-6) \times 10^{14}$ G.",2005-04-14T14:40:56Z
Far Infrared Observations of Radio Quasars and FR II Radio Galaxies,"We report MIPS photometry of 20 radio-loud quasars and galaxies at 24 and 70
um (and of five at 160 um). We combine this sample with additional sources
detected in the far infrared by IRAS and ISO for a total of 47 objects,
including 23 steep spectrum Type I AGNs: radio-loud quasars and broad line
radio galaxies; and 24 Type II AGNs: narrow line and weak line FR II radio
galaxies. Of this sample, the far infrared emission of all but 3C 380 appears
to be dominated by emission by dust heated by the AGN and by star formation.
The AGN appears to contribute more than 50% of the far infrared luminosity in
most of sources. It is also expected that the material around the nucleus is
optically thin in the far infrared. Thus, the measurements at these wavelengths
can be used to test the orientation-dependent unification model. As predicted
by the model, the behavior of the sources is consistent with the presence of an
obscuring circumnuclear torus; in fact, we find it may still have significant
optical depth at 24 um.In addition, as expected for the radio-loud quasars,
there is a significant correlation between the low frequency radio (178 MHz)
and the 70 um emission, two presumably isotropic indicators of nuclear
activity. This result is consistent with the simple unified scheme. However,
there is a population of radio galaxies that are underluminous at 70 um
compared with the radio-loud quasars and hence are a challenge to the simple
unified model.",2005-04-28T03:47:33Z
Chemical processes in star forming regions,"This paper will review the basic concepts of gas-phase and grain surface
chemistry of dense molecular clouds, where low mass and high mass stars form.
The chemistry of cold pre-stellar cloud cores, where molecular freeze-out and
deuterium fractionation dominate, will be presented. Then, following cloud
evolution after protostellar birth, hot core and shock chemistry will be
discussed in view of recent observations. A brief summary of the chemistry in
protoplanetary disks will also be furnished. The aim is to identify important

the main problems still open in the field of astrochemistry.",2005-04-13T15:29:38Z
Eleven New DAVs from the Sloan Survey,"We report the discovery of eleven new variable DA white dwarf (ZZ Ceti)
stars. Candidates were selected by deriving temperatures from model fits to
spectra obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We also find objects whose
temperatures and gravities indicate they lie within the instability strip for
pulsation, but which were not observed to vary. Although the temperatures are
based on relatively low S/N spectra, an impure strip is unexpected, and if
confirmed suggests that our knowledge of the pulsation mechanism is incomplete.

82.",2005-02-24T20:32:26Z
"Serendipitous discovery of the unidentified extended TeV gamma-ray
  source HESS J1303-631","The serendipitous discovery of an unidentified extended TeVgamma-ray source
close to the galactic plane named HESS J1303-631 at a significance of 21
standard deviations is reported. The observations were performed between
February and June 2004 with the H.E.S.S. stereoscopic system of Cherenkov
telescopes in Namibia. HESS J1303-631 was discovered roughly 0.6 deg north of
the binary system PSR B1259-63/SS 2883, the target object of the initial
observation campaign which was also detected at TeV energies in the same field
of view. HESS J1303-631 is extended with a width of an assumed intrinsic
Gaussian emission profile of sigma = (0.16 +- 0.02) deg and the integral flux
above 380 GeV is compatible with constant emission over the entire
observational period of (17 +- 3)% of the Crab Nebula flux. The measured energy
spectrum can be described by a power-law dN/dE ~ E^-Gamma with a photon index
of Gamma = 2.44 +- 0.05_stat +- 0.2_syst. Up to now, no counterpart at other

Gravity-wave detectors as probes of extra dimensions,"If string theory is correct, then our observable Universe may be a

existence of extra dimensions leads to oscillations that leave a spectroscopic
signature in the gravity-wave signal from black holes. The detectors that have

"Confidence limits of evolutionary synthesis models. IV Moving forward to
  a probabilistic formulation","Synthesis models predict the integrated properties of stellar populations.
Several problems exist in this field, mostly related to the fact that
integrated properties are distributed. To date, this aspect has been either
ignored (as in standard synthesis models, which are inherently deterministic)
or interpreted phenomenologically (as in Monte Carlo simulations, which
describe distributed properties rather than explain them). We approach
population synthesis as a problem in probability theory, in which stellar
luminosities are random variables extracted from the stellar luminosity
distribution function (sLDF). We derive the population LDF (pLDF) for clusters
of any size from the sLDF, obtaining the scale relations that link the sLDF to
the pLDF. We recover the predictions of standard synthesis models, which are
shown to compute the mean of the sLDF. We provide diagnostic diagrams and a
simplified recipe for testing the statistical richness of observed clusters,
thereby assessing whether standard synthesis models can be safely used or a
statistical treatment is mandatory. We also recover the predictions of Monte
Carlo simulations, with the additional bonus of being able to interpret them in
mathematical and physical terms. We give examples of problems that can be
addressed through our probabilistic formalism. Though still under development,
ours is a powerful approach to population synthesis. In an era of resolved
observations and pipelined analyses of large surveys, this paper is offered as
a signpost in the field of stellar populations.",2005-04-21T20:00:15Z
Statefinder diagnostic for holographic dark energy model,"In this paper we study the holographic dark energy model proposed by Li from
the statefinder viewpoint. We plot the evolutionary trajectories of the model
with $c=1$ in the statefinder parameter-planes. The statefinder diagrams
characterize the properties of the holographic dark energy and show the
discrimination between this scenario and other dark energy models. We also
perform a statefinder diagnostic to the holographic dark energy model in cases
of different $c$ which given by three fits to observational data. The result
indicates that from the statefinder viewpoint $c$ plays a significant role in

X-ray Confirmation of the Intermediate Polar HT Cam,"We report on the first pointed X-ray observations with XMM-Newton and RXTE
satellites of the X-ray source RXJ0757.0+6306=HT Cam. We detect a strong 515s
X-ray modulation confirming the optical photometric period found in 1998, which
definitively assigns this source to the intermediate polar class of magnetic
cataclysmic variables. The lack of orbital sidebands in the X-rays indicates
that the X-ray period is the spin period of the accreting white dwarf.
Simultaneous ultraviolet and optical B-band photometry acquired with the
XMM-Newton Optical Monitor and coordinated optical UBVRI photometric data
acquired at the Nordic Optical Telescope (La Palma) show that the optical pulse
is in phase with the X-rays and hence originates in the magnetically confined
accretion flow. The lack of ultraviolet spin modulation suggests that
accretion-induced heating on the white dwarf surface is not important in this
source. Spectral analyses of XMM-Newton EPIC and RGS spectra show that HT Cam
has a multi-temperature spectrum and, contrary to most intermediate polars, it
does not suffer from strong absorption. With its 86min orbital period, HT Cam
is then the third confirmed system of this class below the 2-3hr period gap

HST/ACS Lyman alpha imaging of the nearby starburst ESO338-IG04,"ESO338-IG04 is a well known, local, luminous Blue Compact Galaxy. It has a
complex morphology and contains a central young starburst with compact young
star clusters. The galaxy was imaged using HST/ACS in the Lyman alpha line and
continuum. Using the Starburst99 synthetic spectra and other imaging data from
HST/WFPC2 we developed a technique that allows us to make the first
photometrically valid continuum subtraction for the LYa line. Our results are
in qualitative agreement with the models of LYa escape being regulated by
kinematical properties of the interstellar medium. The line-only image shows
LYa in both emission and absorption. Notably, emission is seen from central
bright young clusters and is in spatial agreement with the features present in
a longslit spectrum taken with HST/STIS. Diffuse LYa emission regions are seen
surrounding the central starburst where photons escape after one or more
resonant scatterings in HI. These regions dominate the total LYa output.
Photometry reveals a total LYa flux of 194 x 10^-14 erg/s/cm^2. Inside an
artificial aperture matching that of the IUE satelite, we measure a LYa flux
and equivalent width consistent with previous studies using the IUE. Analysis
of parameter dependencies show our technique to be largely parameter
independent, producing LYa maps indistinguishable from one another by eye and
with fluxes consistent with one another to better than 50%. By comparison of
LYa fluxes with Ha fluxes of a previous study, we estimate that each observed
LYa photon has undergone ~2 additional scatterings. We see that LYa line
closely correlate with other tracers of kinematics.",2005-03-15T16:46:13Z
Astrophysical constraints from gamma-ray spectroscopy,"Gamma-ray lines from cosmic sources provide unique isotopic information,
since they originate from energy level transitions in the atomic nucleus.
Gamma-ray telescopes explored this astronomical window in the past three
decades, detecting radioactive isotopes that have been ejected in interstellar
space by cosmic nucleosynthesis events and nuclei that have been excited
through collisions with energetic particles. Short-lived radioactivities have
been detected in a couple of supernovae (56Co and 57Co in SN1987A, 44Ti in Cas
A), the diffuse glow of long-lived 26Al has been mapped along the entire plane
of the Galaxy, several excited nuclei have been detected in solar flares, and,
last but not least, positron annihilation has been observed in the inner Galaxy
since the 70ies. Recent imaging and line shape measurements of e-/e+
annihilation emission from the Galactic bulge can hardly be accounted for by
conventional sources of positrons; recent 26Al emission and line width
measurement from the inner Galaxy and from the Cygnus region can constrain the
properties of the interstellar medium; a diffuse 60Fe gamma-ray line emission
appears rather weak, in view of current theoretical predictions. Recent
Galactic core-collapse supernovae are studied through 44Ti radioactivity, but,
apart from Cas A, no other source has been found. The characteristic signature
of 22Na-line emission from a nearby O-Ne-Mg novae is expected to be measured
during INTEGRAL's lifetime.",2005-02-16T17:48:07Z
The cool wake around 4C 34.16 as seen by XMM-Newton,"We present XMM-Newton observations of the wake-radiogalaxy system 4C34.16,
which shows a cool and dense wake trailing behind 4C34.16's host galaxy. A
comparison with numerical simulations is enlightening, as they demonstrate that
the wake is produced mainly by ram pressure stripping during the galactic
motion though the surrounding cluster. The mass of the wake is a substantial
fraction of the mass of an elliptical galaxy's X-ray halo. This observational
fact supports a wake formation scenario similar to the one demonstrated
numerically by Acreman et al (2003): the host galaxy of 4C34.16 has fallen into
its cluster, and is currently crossing its central regions. A substantial
fraction of its X-ray halo has been stripped by ram pressure, and remains
behind to form the galaxy wake.",2005-04-19T19:16:07Z
Pulsars and Their Nebulae as EGRET Sources,"At the end of the EGRET mission, only 6-8 Galactic sources had been
identified as young pulsars. Since then, several energetic pulsars have been
discovered in EGRET error boxes along the Galactic plane, as well as several
pulsar wind nebulae from which pulsations have not yet been discovered. Some of
these nebulae are associated with moderately variable EGRET sources, suggesting
that the gamma-ray emission might be coming from the nebula rather than from
the pulsar magnetosphere. There is also a population of unidentified EGRET
sources at mid-Galactic latitudes which have been proposed to be either nearby
middle-aged pulsars or millisecond pulsars. I review the current status of
observational studies of pulsars associated with EGRET sources and what they
suggest the upcoming AGILE and GLAST gamma-ray missions might observe.",2005-03-22T22:20:37Z
The Kinematic Signature of Face-On Peanut-Shaped Bulges,"We present a kinematic diagnostic for peanut-shaped bulges in nearly face-on
galaxies. The face-on view provides a novel perspective on peanuts which would
allow study of their relation to bars and disks in greater detail than hitherto
possible. The diagnostic is based on the fact that peanut shapes are associated
with a flat density distribution in the vertical direction. We show that the
kinematic signature corresponding to such a distribution is a minimum in the
fourth-order Gauss-Hermite moment $s_4$. We demonstrate our method on $N$-body
simulations of varying peanut strength, showing that strong peanuts can be
recognized to inclinations $i \simeq 30\degrees$, regardless of the strength of
the bar. We also consider compound systems in which a bulge is present in the
initial conditions as may happen if bulges form at high redshift through
mergers. We show that in this case, because the vertical structure of the bulge
is not derived from that of the disk, that the signature of a peanut in $s_4$
is weakened. Thus the same kinematic signature of peanuts can be used to
explore bulge formation mechanisms. The observational requirements for
identifying peanuts with this method are challenging, but feasible.",2005-04-24T16:32:32Z
"V453 Oph: a s-process enriched, but carbon-deficient RV Tauri star of
  low intrinsic metallicity","This paper reports the detection of a heavy element enriched RV Tauri
variable with an abundance pattern that differs significantly from a standard
s-process enriched object: V453 Oph. Based on optical high-resolution spectra,
we determined that this object of low intrinsic metallicity ([Fe/H] = -2.2) has
a mild, but significant, enrichment ([s/Fe] ~ +0.5) of heavy elements for which
the distribution points to slow neutron capture nucleosynthesis. This result is
strengthened by a comparative analysis to the non-enriched RV Tauri star DS Aqr
([s/Fe] = 0.0). Although V453 Oph is the first RV Tauri star showing a strong
s-process signature, it is NOT accompanied by C enhancement, challenging our
current nucleosynthetic models of post-AGB stars that predict a simultaneous
enrichment in C and s-process elements. The low N abundance excludes CN cycling
as being responsible for the low C abundance. We explore three different
scenarios to explain the heavy element distribution in this evolved object: an
enrichment of the parental cloud, an accretion scenario in which the chemical
patterns were acquired by mass transfer in a binary system and an intrinsic
enrichment by dredge-up.",2005-04-27T11:42:04Z
"Analysis of medium resolution spectra by automated methods - application
  to M55 and omega Centauri","We have employed feedforward neural networks trained on synthetic spectra in
the range 3800 to 5600 AA with resolutions of 2-3 AA to determine metallicities
from spectra of about 1000 main-sequence turn-off, subgiant and red giant stars
in the globular clusters M55 and omega Cen. The overall metallicity accuracies
are of the order of 0.15 to 0.2 dex. In addition, we tested how well the
stellar parameters logg and Teff can be retrieved from such data without
additional colour or photometric information. We find overall uncertainties of
0.3 to 0.4 dex for logg and 140 to 190 K for Teff. In order to obtain some
measure of uncertainty for the determined values of [Fe/H], logg and Teff, we
applied the bootstrap method for the first time to neural networks for this
kind of parametrization problem. The distribution of metallicities for stars in
omega Cen clearly shows a large spread in agreement with the well known
multiple stellar populations in this cluster.",2005-03-16T14:12:18Z
AGN Unification and the X-ray Background,"Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) unification, which implies a large number of
obscured AGN, can explain the optical, infrared and X-ray content of deep
multiwavelength surveys. Here, we show that the same model also successfully
explains the spectral shape and intensity of the X-ray background. The simplest
possible unified model assumes a constant ratio of obscured to unobscured AGN,
independent of redshift or luminosity. With almost no free parameters, the
predicted X-ray background agrees remarkably well with observations. Both the
observed properties of deep AGN samples and the X-ray background can be
explained by the same model without invoking different evolution for obscured
and unobscured AGN. Recent observational evidence shows that the ratio of
obscured to unobscured AGN may depend on luminosity. An AGN unification model
that allows for such a dependence also fits the X-ray background spectrum, and
the predicted numbers counts in the 2-10 keV X-ray band are in good agreement
with observations. We present predictions for the source counts in hard X-rays
(10-100 keV), which indicate that future missions like the Black Hole Finder
will observe thousands of heavily obscured AGN.",2005-05-13T20:08:58Z
GRB990123: multiwavelength afterglow study,"We report on the BeppoSAX and multiwavelength data analysis of the afterglow
of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) 990123. Mainly due to its exceptional brightness, this
is the only source for which the Wide Field Cameras have allowed an early
detection of the X-ray afterglow between about 20 and 60 min after the GRB
trigger. Besides, again for the first time, high-energy emission from the
afterglow was detected up to 60 keV. The backwards extrapolation of the
afterglow decay smoothly reconnects with the late GRB emission, thus indicating
that both are consistent with being produced by the same phenomenon. For the
X-ray afterglow we found a power-law decay with index alpha_X = 1.46 +/- 0.04;
the spectrum has a power-law shape with photon index Gamma about 2. An
extensive set of multiwavelength observations on the afterglow, collected from
the literature and made during the BeppoSAX pointing, allowed constructing a
Spectral Flux Distribution. We performed an analysis of the GRB afterglow
emission in the context of the ""fireball"" model.",2005-05-02T16:18:20Z
Evolving Disks in Cold Dark Matter Cosmology,"Despite having entered the era of ""precision cosmology,"" the formation of
galaxies within the favored CDM cosmological paradigm remains problematic. By
relating our N-body/smooth particle hydro-dynamical simulation to an extensive
range of Galactic and extragalactic observations, we shed light on the
formation and evolution of the Milky Way and other late type galaxies. In light
of recent observations of the stellar populations of extragalactic thick disks,
we examine the proposal that the thick disk formed in a high redshift period
characterized by gas rich merging. We show such a scenario to be consistent
with color observations. We then follow the evolution of structural parameters
of the subsequently formed disk galaxy, from redshift ~1 to the present.
Consistent with observation, little evolution in the ratio of scale-height to
scale-length is found in our simulated galaxy, despite its somewhat chaotic
origins. The simulated galaxy in this report forms part of a larger study of a
suite of galaxies, with which these issues are to be studied in detail.",2005-03-15T19:10:50Z
The inflationary prediction for primordial non-gaussianity,"We extend the \delta N formalism so that it gives all of the stochastic
properties of the primordial curvature perturbation \zeta if the initial field
perturbations are gaussian. The calculation requires only the knowledge of some
family of unperturbed universes. A formula is given for the normalisation \fnl
of the bispectrum of \zeta, which is the main signal of non-gaussianity.
Examples of the use of the formula are given, and its relation to cosmological
perturbation theory is explained.",2005-04-02T21:44:44Z
"Molecular gas and continuum emission in 3C48: Evidence for two merger
  nuclei?","We present new interferometer observations of the CO(1-0) line and mm
continuum emission from 3C48 - one of the nearest examples of a merger
activating a quasar. Our new CO data show that most of the CO is not in a disk
around the quasar 3C48, but rather in a second nucleus associated with the
source 3C48A ~1"" to the north-east, recently studied in the near-IR by Zuther
et al. (2004). This main CO source has a strong velocity gradient (140km/s over
about 1""). Our new data also show a second, weaker CO source at the QSO itself.
At 1.2mm, the continuum emission is elongated in the direction of the radio jet
and towards 3C48A. We model the 1.2mm continuum with three different sources in
3C48 - the 3C48 QSO, the 3C48 jet, and the second nucleus 3C48A. We suggest
that the unusually bright and extended nature of the jet may be due to its
interaction with the second merger nucleus 3C48A.",2005-05-09T08:35:20Z
"Masers and the Massive Star Formation Process: New Insights Through
  Infrared Observations","Our mid-infrared and near-infrared surveys over the last five years have
helped to strengthen and clarify the relationships between water, methanol, and
OH masers and the star formation process. Our surveys show that maser emission
seems to be more closely associated with mid-infrared emission than cm radio
continuum emission from UC HII regions. We find that masers of all molecular
species surveyed trace a wide variety of phenomena and show a proclivity for
linear distributions. The vast majority of these linear distributions can be
explained by outflows or shocks, and in general do not appear to trace
circumstellar disks as was previously thought. Some water and methanol masers
that are not associated with radio continuum emission appear to trace
infrared-bright hot cores, the earliest observable stage of massive stellar
life before the onset of a UC HII region.",2005-06-08T00:21:59Z
Detecting a small perturbation through its non-Gaussianity,"A highly non-gaussian cosmological perturbation with a flat spectrum has
unusual stochastic properties. We show that they depend on the size of the box
within which the perturbation is defined, but that for a typical observer the
parameters defining the perturbation `run' to compensate for any change in the
box size. Focusing on the primordial curvature perturbation, we show that an
un-correlated gaussian-squared component is bounded at around the 10% level by
the WMAP bound on the bispectrum, and we show that a competitive bound may
follow from the trispectrum when it too is bounded by WMAP. Similar
considerations apply to a highly non-gaussian isocurvature perturbation.",2005-04-04T15:35:25Z
The HI content of Fornax dwarf elliptical galaxies: FCC032 and FCC336,"We present HI 21cm line observations, obtained with the Australia Telescope
Compact Array, of two dwarf elliptical galaxies (dEs) in the Fornax cluster:
FCC032 and FCC336. The optical positions and velocities of these galaxies place
them well within the Fornax cluster. FCC032 was detected at the 3sigma
significance level with a total HI flux density of 0.66+-0.22 Jy km s^-1 or an
HI mass of 5.0+-1.7 10^7 h_75^-2 M_sun. Based on our deep Halpha+[NII]
narrow-band images, obtained with FORS2 mounted on the VLT, this dE was already
known to contain 600-1800 h_75^-2 M_sun of ionised Hydrogen (depending on the
relative strengths of the Halpha and [NII] emission lines). Hence, this is the
first study of the complex, multi-phase interstellar medium of a dE outside the
Local Group. FCC336 was detected at the same significance level: 0.37+-0.10 Jy
km s^-1 or a total HI mass of 2.8+-0.7 10^7 h_75^-2,M_sun. Using a compilation
of HI data of dwarf galaxies, we find that the observed high HI-mass boundary
of the distribution of dIrrs, BCDs, and dEs in a log(L_B) versus log (M_HI)
diagram is in good agreement with a simple chemical evolution model with
continuous star formation. The existence of many gas-poor dEs (undetected at
21cm) suggest that the environment (or more particularly, a galaxy's orbit
within a cluster) also plays a crucial role in determining the amount of gas in
present-day dEs. E.g., FCC032 and FCC336 are located in the sparsely populated
outskirts of the Fornax cluster. This is in agreement with HI surveys of dEs in
the Virgo Cluster and an Halpha survey of the Fornax Cluster, which also tend
to place gas-rich dwarf galaxies in the cluster periphery.",2005-04-12T13:12:30Z
"Detecting Intracluster Gas Motion in Galaxy Clusters: Mock Astro-E2
  Observations","We explore the detectability of bulk motions in the X-ray emitting
intracluster medium (ICM) using a catalog of 1,836 mock Astro-E2 observations
of simulated clusters of galaxies. We generate high resolution mock spectra for
two observing strategies: a four-pointing mosaic and a single central pointing.
Normalizing to 200 (400) photons in the iron K-alpha region for the mosaic
(central) study, we fit Poisson realizations of each simulated spectrum to a
velocity broadened isothermal plasma emission model. We confirm that the
velocity characteristics (mean and dispersion) returned by the spectral
fittings are unbiased measures of the emission-weighted values within the
observed region, with scatter 55 km/s. The maximum velocity difference between
mosaic element pairs $\Delta v_{\rm max}$ has ~ 6% likelihood of being
transonic ($\Delta v_{\rm max} \ge 0.5 c_s$), and the likelihood falls steeply,
$p \spropto (\Delta v_{\rm max}/c_s)^{-4}$, at high Mach number. The velocity
broadening parameter $\sigma_v$ from the central pointing fit exceeds the
thermal value in 49% of the cases, with again a $\sigma_v^{-4}$ tail at large
dispersion. We present as case studies the clusters that yield the strongest
signal for each observing strategy.",2005-03-12T18:56:04Z
Phase Correlations and Topological Measures of Large-scale Structure,"In these lecture notes I discussed the importance of phase correlations for
the morphology of large-scale structure and how phase analysis can probe
primordial non-Gaussianity and/or foreground contamination in CMB temperature
maps. I illustrate the ideas with application to the preliminary WMAP
first-year data. I also briefly introduce topological characteristics such as
the genus and Minkowski functionals, and how they provide a real-space
diagnostic of phase correlations.",2005-02-04T09:32:57Z
"Hydrodynamic Simulations of A Moving Substructure in A Cluster of
  Galaxies: Cold Fronts and Turbulence Generation","We perform three dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a moving
substructure in a cluster of galaxies. We investigate dynamical evolution of
the intracluster medium (ICM) in and around the substructure moving radially in
the larger cluster's gravitational potential, and its observational
consequences. After the substructure passes the larger cluster's center, a bow
shock and clear contact discontinuity form in front of it. The contact
discontinuity looks like a sharp cold front in the X-ray image synthesized from
the simulation results. This agrees with a structure found in 1E 0657-56. The
flow structure remains laminar before the first turnaround because the
ram-pressure stripping is dominant over the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities on the boundary between the substructure and the ambient ICM.
  When a subcluster oscillates radially around the larger cluster's center,
both Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities develop well and the
flow structure becomes highly turbulent. Around the turnaround, the
subcluster's cold gas is pushed out of its potential well.
  Therefore, the cold gas component appears to be in front of the subcluster. A
relatively blunt cold front appears in the simulated
  X-ray image because the contact discontinuity is perturbed by Rayleigh-Taylor
instabilities. This can explain the ICM structure found in A168.",2005-05-13T05:14:59Z
"Red-sequence galaxies with young stars and dust: The cluster Abell
  901/902 seen with COMBO-17","We report the discovery of a rich component of dusty star-forming galaxies
contaminating the red-sequence in the supercluster system comprising Abell
901a, 901b and A902 at redshift ~0.17. These galaxies do not fit into the
colour-density relation, because their preferred habitat is different from that
of regular red-sequence galaxies, which are typically dust-poor, old and
passively evolving. The dusty red galaxies prefer the medium-density outskirts
of clusters while being rare in both the low-density field and the high-density
cluster cores. This new result is based on the information content in the
medium-band photometry of the COMBO-17 survey. The photo-z accuracy of the ~800
brightest cluster galaxies is <0.01 and of the order of the velocity dispersion
of the cluster. This enables us to select a rich and clean cluster sample, in
which we can trace age-sensitive and dust-sensitive spectral features
independently with the detailed medium-band SED data. We find the red colour of
the dusty galaxies to be a result of dust extinction combined with relatively
old stellar ages. We speculate that the dusty red galaxies could either be a
product of minor mergers between established old red cluster galaxies with
infalling blue field galaxies, or mark a period in the internal transformation
of blue field galaxies into red cluster galaxies, which is triggered by the
environmental influences experienced during cluster infall.",2005-06-07T20:13:00Z
"An expanding radio nebula produced by a giant flare from the magnetar
  SGR 1806-20","Soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) are ""magnetars"", a small class of slowly spinning
neutron stars with extreme surface magnetic fields, ~10^15 gauss. On 2004
December 27, a giant flare was detected from the magnetar SGR 1806-20, the
third such event ever recorded. This burst of energy was detected by a variety
of instruments and even caused an ionospheric disturbance in the Earth's upper
atmosphere recorded around the globe. Here we report the detection of a fading
radio afterglow produced by this outburst, with a luminosity 500 times larger
than the only other detection of a similar source. From day 6 to day 19 after
the flare from SGR 1806-20, a resolved, linearly polarized, radio nebula was
seen, expanding at approximately a quarter the speed of light. To create this
nebula, at least 4x10^43 ergs of energy must have been emitted by the giant
flare in the form of magnetic fields and relativistic particles. The
combination of spatially resolved structure and rapid time evolution allows a
study in unprecedented detail of a nearby analog to supernovae and gamma-ray
bursts.",2005-02-20T21:00:22Z
"Spectroscopic Survey of the Galaxy with Gaia II. The expected science
  yield from the Radial Velocity Spectrometer","The Gaia mission is designed as a Galaxy explorer, and will measure
simultaneously, in a survey mode, the five or six phase space parameters of all
stars brighter than 20th magnitude, as well as providing a description of their
astrophysical characteristics. These measurements are obtained by combining an
astrometric instrument with micro-arcsecond capabilities, a photometric system
giving the magnitudes and colours in 15 bands and a medium resolution
spectrograph named the Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS). The latter
instrument will produce spectra in the 848 to 874 nm wavelength range, with a
resolving power R = 11 500, from which radial velocities, rotational
velocities, atmospheric parameters and abundances can be derived. A companion
paper (Katz et al. 2004) presents the characteristics of the RVS and its
performance. This paper details the outstanding scientific impact of this
important part of the Gaia satellite on some key open questions in present day
astrophysics. The unbiased and simultaneous acquisition of multi-epoch radial
velocities and individual abundances of key elements in parallel with the
astrometric parameters is essential for the determination of the dynamical
state and formation history of our Galaxy. Moreover, for stars brighter than
V=15, the resolving power of the RVS will give information about most of the
effects which influence the position of a star in the Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram, placing unprecedented constraints on the age, internal structure and
evolution of stars of all types. Finally, the RVS multi-epoch observations are
ideally suited to the identification, classification and characterisation of
the many types of double, multiple and variable stars.",2005-06-03T16:51:02Z
"Observations in the 1.3 and 1.5 THz Atmospheric Windows with the
  Receiver Lab Telescope","The Receiver Lab Telescope (RLT) is a ground-based terahertz telescope; it is
currently the only instrument producing astronomical data between 1 and 2 THz.
The capabilities of the RLT have been expanding since observations began in
late 2002. Initial observations were limited to the 850 GHz and 1.03 THz
windows due to the availability of solid state local oscillators. In the last
year we have begun observations with new local oscillators for the 1.3 and 1.5
THz atmospheric windows. These oscillators provide access to the 11-10 and
13-12 lines of CO at 1.267 and 1.497 THz, as well as the [N II] line at 1.461
THz. We report on our first measurements of these high CO transitions, which
represent the highest-frequency detections ever made from the ground. We also
present initial observations of [N II] and discuss the implications of this
non-detection for the standard estimates of the strength of this line.",2005-05-12T22:52:07Z
Cusps in CDM halos,"We resolve the inner region of a massive cluster forming in a cosmological
LCDM simulation with a mass resolution of 2*10^6 Msun and before z=4.4 even
3*10^5 Msun. This is a billion times less than the clusters final virial mass
and a substantial increase over current LCDM simulations. We achieve this
resolution using a new multi-mass refinement procedure and are now able to
probe a dark matter halo density profile down to 0.1 percent of the virial
radius. The inner density profile of this cluster halo is well fitted by a
power-law rho ~ r^-gamma down to the smallest resolved scale. An inner region
with roughly constant logarithmic slope is now resolved, which suggests that
cuspy profiles describe the inner profile better than recently proposed
profiles with a core. The cluster studied here is one out of a sample of six
high resolution cluster simulations of Diemand et al. (2004) and it's inner
slope of gamma = 1.2 lies close to the sample average.",2005-04-08T21:30:45Z
High-Velocity Features: a ubiquitous property of Type Ia SNe,"Evidence of high-velocity features such as those seen in the near-maximum
spectra of some Type Ia Supernovae (eg SN 2000cx) has been searched for in the
available SNIa spectra observed earlier than one week before B maximum. Recent
observational efforts have doubled the number of SNeIa with very early spectra.
Remarkably, all SNeIa with early data (7 in our RTN sample and 10 from other
programmes) show signs of such features, to a greater or lesser degree, in CaII
IR, and some also in SiII 6255A line. High-velocity features may be interpreted
as abundance or density enhancements. Abundance enhancements would imply an
outer region dominated by Si and Ca. Density enhancements may result from the
sweeping up of circumstellar material by the highest velocity SN ejecta. In
this scenario, the high incidence of HVFs suggests that a thick disc and/or a
high-density companion wind surrounds the exploding white dwarf, as may be the
case in Single Degenerate systems. Large-scale angular fluctuations in the
radial density and abundance distribution may also be responsible: this could
originate in the explosion, and would suggest a deflagration as the more likely
explosion mechanism. CSM-interaction and surface fluctuations may coexist,
possibly leaving different signatures on the spectrum. In some SNe the HVFs are
narrowly confined in velocity, suggesting the ejection of blobs of burned
material.",2005-02-25T12:56:26Z
Can Minor Planets be Used to Assess Gravity in the Outer Solar System?,"The twin Pioneer spacecraft have been tracked for over thirty years as they
headed out of the solar system. After passing 20 AU from the Sun, both
exhibited a systematic error in their trajectories that can be interpreted as a
constant acceleration towards the Sun. This Pioneer Effect is most likely
explained by spacecraft systematics, but there have been no convincing
arguments that that is the case. The alternative is that the Pioneer Effect
represents a real phenomenon and perhaps new physics. What is lacking is a
means of measuring the effect, its variation, its potential anisotropies, and
its region of influence. We show that minor planets provide an observational
vehicle for investigating the gravitational field in the outer solar system,
and that a sustained observation campaign against properly chosen minor planets
could confirm or refute the existence of the Pioneer Effect. Additionally, even
if the Pioneer Effect does not represent a new physical phenomenon, minor
planets can be used to probe the gravitational field in the outer Solar System
and since there are very few intermediate range tests of gravity at the
multiple AU distance scale, this is a worthwhile endeavor in its own right.",2005-04-17T17:04:48Z
Pulsating young brown dwarfs,"We present the results of a nonadiabatic, linear stability analysis of models
of very low-mass stars (VLMSs) and brown dwarfs (BDs) during the deuterium
burning phase in the center. We find unstable fundamental modes with periods
varying between ~5 hr for a 0.1 Msun star and ~1 hr for a 0.02 Msun BD. The
growth time of the instability decreases with decreasing mass and remains well
below the deuterium burning time scale in the mass range considered (0.1--0.02
Msun). These results are robust against variations of the relevant input
physics in the evolutionary models. We identify possible candidates for
pulsational variability among known VLMSs and BDs in nearby star forming
regions whose location in the HR diagram falls within or close to the boundary
of the instability strip. Finally, we discuss the possibility that the
variability observed in a few objects with periods of ~1 hr can be interpreted
in terms of pulsation.",2005-02-02T15:41:49Z
"Formation and Evolution of Planetary Systems: Upper Limits the Gas Mass
  in HD105","We report infrared spectroscopic observations of HD 105, a nearby ($\sim 40$
pc) and relatively young ($\sim 30$ Myr) G0 star with excess infrared continuum
emission, which has been modeled as arising from an optically thin
circumstellar dust disk with an inner hole of size $\gtrsim 13$ AU. We have
used the high spectral resolution mode of the Infrared Spectrometer (IRS) on
the Spitzer Space Telescope to search for gas emission lines from the disk. The
observations reported here provide upper limits to the fluxes of H$_2$ S(0)
28$\mu$m, H$_2$ S(1) 17$\mu$m, H$_2$ S(2) 12 $\mu$m, [FeII] 26$\mu$m, [SiII]
35$\mu$m, and [SI] 25$\mu$m infrared emission lines. The H$_2$ line upper
limits directly place constraints on the mass of warm molecular gas in the
disk: $M({\rm H_2})< 4.6$, 3.8$\times 10^{-2}$, and $3.0\times 10^{-3}$ M$_J$
at $T= 50$, 100, and 200 K, respectively. We also compare the line flux upper
limits to predictions from detailed thermal/chemical models of various gas
distributions in the disk. These comparisons indicate that if the gas
distribution has an inner hole with radius $r_{i,gas}$, the surface density at
that inner radius is limited to values ranging from $\lesssim 3$ gm cm$^{-2}$
at $r_{i,gas}=0.5$ AU to 0.1 gm cm$^{-2}$ at $r_{i,gas}= 5-20$ AU. These values
are considerably below the value for a minimum mass solar nebula, and suggest
that less than 1 M$_J$ of gas (at any temperature) exists in the 1-40 AU
planet-forming region. Therefore, it is unlikely that there is sufficient gas
for gas giant planet formation to occur in HD 105 at this time.",2005-06-10T22:13:27Z
"Boundary Effective Field Theory and Trans-Planckian Perturbations:
  Astrophysical Implications","We contrast two approaches to calculating trans-Planckian corrections to the
inflationary perturbation spectrum: the New Physics Hypersurface [NPH] model,
in which modes are normalized when their physical wavelength first exceeds a
critical value, and the Boundary Effective Field Theory [BEFT] approach, where
the initial conditions for all modes are set at the same time, and modified by
higher dimensional operators enumerated via an effective field theory
calculation. We show that these two approaches -- as currently implemented --
lead to radically different expectations for the trans-Planckian corrections to
the CMB and emphasize that in the BEFT formalism we expect the perturbation
spectrum to be dominated by quantum gravity corrections for all scales shorter
than some critical value. Conversely, in the NPH case the quantum effects only
dominate the longest modes that are typically much larger than the present
horizon size. Furthermore, the onset of the breakdown in the standard
inflationary perturbation calculation predicted by the BEFT formalism is likely
to be associated with a feature in the perturbation spectrum, and we discuss
the observational signatures of this feature in both CMB and large scale
structure observations. Finally, we discuss possible modifications to both
calculational frameworks that would resolve the contradictions identified here.",2005-05-20T11:57:01Z
Cosmology with Gamma Ray Bursts,"Apparently, Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are all but standard candles. Their
emission is collimated into a cone and the received flux depends on the cone
aperture angle. Fortunately we can derive the aperture angle through an
achromatic steepening of the lightcurve of the afterglow, and thus we can
measure the ""true"" energetics of the prompt emission. Ghirlanda et al. (2004)
found that this collimation-corrected energy correlates tightly with
thefrequency at which most of the radiation of the prompt is emitted. Through
this correlation we can infer the burst energy accurately enough for a
cosmological use. Using the best known 15 GRBs we find very encouraging results
that emphasize the cosmological GRB role. Probing the universe with high
accuracy up to high redshifts, GRBs establish a new insight on the cosmic
expanding acceleration history and accomplish the role of ""missing link""
between the Cosmic Microwave Background and type Ia supernovae, motivating the
most optimistic hopes for what can be obtained from the bursts detected by
SWIFT.",2005-04-13T20:02:11Z
Constraints on the Variation of G from Primordial Nucleosynthesis,"We study here the effect of a varying G on the evolution of the early
Universe and, in particular, on primordial nucleosynthesis. This variation of G
is modelled using the Brans-Dicke theory as well as a more general class of
scalar-tensor theories. Modified nucleosynthesis codes are used to investigate
this effect and the results obtained are used to constrain the parameters of
the theories. We extend previous studies of primordial nucleosynthesis in
scalar-tensor theories by including effects which can cause a slow variation of
G during radiation domination and by including a late-time accelerating phase
to the Universe's history. We include a brief discussion on the epoch of
matter-radiation equality in Brans-Dicke theory, which is also of interest for
determining the positions of the cosmic microwave background power-spectrum
peaks.",2005-04-19T17:15:14Z
"The 1 - 50 keV spectral and timing analysis of IGR J18027-2016: an
  eclipsing, high mass X-ray binary","We report the association of the INTEGRAL source IGR J18027-2016 with the
BeppoSAX source SAX J1802.7-2017. IGR J18027-2016 is seen to be a weak,
persistent source by the IBIS/ISGRI instrument on board INTEGRAL with an
average source count rate of 0.55 counts s^-1 (~6.1 mCrab) in the 20-40 keV
band. Timing analysis performed on the ISGRI data identifies an orbital period
of 4.5696 +/- 0.0009 days and gives an ephemeris of mid-eclipse as, T{mid} =
52931.37 +/- 0.04 MJD. Re-analysis of archival BeppoSAX data has provided a
mass function for the donor star, f(m) = 16 +/- 1 M{sun} and a projected
semimajor axis of a{x}sin{i} = 68 +/- 1 lt-s. We conclude that the donor is an
OB-supergiant with a mass of 18.8-29.3 M{sun} and a radius of 15.0-23.4 R{sun}.
Spectra obtained by XMM-Newton and ISGRI indicate a high hydrogen column
density of NH = 6.8 x 10^22 cm^-2, which suggests intrinsic absorption. The
source appears to be a high mass X-ray binary with the neutron star emitting
X-rays through wind-fed accretion while in an eclipsing orbit around an
OB-supergiant.",2005-05-04T17:13:36Z
How does disk gravity really influence type-I migration ?,"We report an analytical expression for the locations of Lindblad resonances
induced by a perturbing protoplanet, including the effect of disk gravity.
Inner, outer and differential torques are found to be enhanced compared to
situations where a keplerian velocity field for the dynamics of both the disk
and the planet is assumed. Inward migration is strongly accelerated when the
disk gravity is only accounted for in the planet orbital motion. The addition
of disk self-gravity slows down the planet drift but not enough to stop it.",2005-03-10T10:55:01Z

"The Murmur of the Sleeping Black Hole: Detection of Nuclear Ultraviolet
  Variability in LINER Galaxies","LINER nuclei, which are present in many nearby galactic bulges, may be the
manifestation of low-rate or low-radiative-efficiency accretion onto
supermassive central black holes. However, it has been unclear whether the
compact UV nuclear sources present in many LINERs are clusters of massive
stars, rather than being directly related to the accretion process. We have
used HST to monitor the UV variability of a sample of 17 galaxies with LINER
nuclei and compact nuclear UV sources. Fifteen of the 17 galaxies were observed
more than once, with two to five epochs per galaxy, spanning up to a year. We
detect significant variability in most of the sample, with peak-to-peak
amplitudes from a few percent to 50%. In most cases, correlated variations are
seen in two independent bands (F250W and F330W). Comparison to previous UV
measurements indicates, for many objects, long-term variations by factors of a
few over decade timescales. Variability is detected in LINERs with and without
detected compact radio cores, in LINERs that have broad H-alpha wings detected
in their optical spectra (``LINER 1's''), and in those that do not (``LINER
2s''). This variability demonstrates the existence of a non-stellar component
in the UV continuum of all types, and sets a lower limit to the luminosity of
this component. We note a trend in the UV color (F250W/F330W) with spectral
type - LINER 1s tend to be bluer than LINER 2s. This trend may indicate a link
between the shape of the nonstellar continuum and the presence or the
visibility of a broad-line region. In one target, the post-starburst galaxy NGC
4736, we detect variability in a previously noted UV source that is offset by
2.5"" (60 pc in projection) from the nucleus. This may be the nearest example of
a binary active nucleus, and of the process leading to black hole merging.",2005-02-17T12:29:04Z
On the future of Gamma-Ray Burst Cosmology,"With the understanding that the enigmatic Gamma-Ray Burts (GRBs) are beamed
explosions, and with the recently discovered ``Ghirlanda-relation'', the dream
of using GRBs as cosmological yardsticks may have come a few steps closer to
reality. Assuming the Ghirlanda-relation is real, we have investigated possible
constraints on cosmological parameters using a simulated future sample of a
large number of GRBs inspired by the ongoing SWIFT mission. Comparing with
constraints from a future sample of Type Ia supernovae, we find that GRBs are
not efficient in constraining the amount of dark energy or its equation of
state. The main reason for this is that very few bursts are available at low
redshifts.",2005-04-11T15:40:07Z
The Nature of Ultra Luminous X-ray Sources,"We present spectroscopic observations of six optical counterparts of
intermediate luminosity X-ray sources (ULXs) around nearby galaxies. The
spectra of the six objects show the presence of broad emission features. The
identification of these allow us to classify all of the objects as quasars at
higher redshift than their assigned parent galaxy. This is one of the first and
largest identifications of such objects using unambigous optical spectral
features. These results, in conjuction with previous similar identifications of
other sources, indicate that high redshift quasars represent an important
fraction of catalogued ULX sources. We estimate the density of such sources and
compare this with expectations for a population of randomly distributed
background quasars.",2005-02-15T11:34:19Z
"The XMM-Newton view of the relativistic spectral features in
  AXJ0447-0627","The XMM-Newton observation of the optically Type 1 AGN AXJ0447-0627 (z=0.214)
unambiguously reveals a complex, bright and prominent set of lines in the 4-8
keV rest frame energy range. Although, from a phenomenological point of view,
the observed properties can be described by a simple power law model plus 5
narrow Gaussian lines (at rest frame energies of nearly 4.49, 5.55, 6.39, 7.02
and 7.85 keV), we find that a model comprising a power law (Gamma of the order
of 2.2), a reflected relativistic continuum, a narrow Fe I Kalpha line from
neutral material as well as a broad Fe Kalpha relativistic line from a ionized
accretion disk represents a good physical description of the data. The ''double
horned'' profile of the relativistic line implies an inclination of the
accretion disk of the order of 45 degree, and an origin in a narrow region of
the disk, from R_in of the order of 19 GM/c^2 to R_out of the order of 30
GM/c^2. The narrow Fe I Kalpha line from neutral material is probably produced
far from the central black hole, most likely in the putative molecular torus.
Although some of these properties have been already found in other Type 1 AGN
and discussed in the literature, at odd with the objects reported so far we
measure high equivalent widths (EWs) of the observed lines: nearly 1.4 keV for
the ``double horned'' relativistic line and nearly 0.4 keV for the narrow line.",2005-03-30T15:46:30Z
On the Spectrum of Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence,"We propose a phenomenological model for incompressible magnetohydrodynamic
turbulence. We argue that nonlinear-wave interaction weakens as the energy
cascade proceeds to small scales, however, the anisotropy of fluctuations along
the large-scale magnetic field increases, which makes turbulence strong at all
scales. To explain the weakening of the interaction, we propose that
small-scale fluctuations of the velocity and magnetic fields become
increasingly dynamically aligned as their scale decreases, so that turbulent
eddies become locally anisotropic in the plane perpendicular to the large-scale
magnetic field. In the limit of weak anisotropy, that is, weak large-scale
magnetic field, our model reproduces the Goldreich-Sridhar spectrum, while the
limit of strong anisotropy, that is, strong large-scale magnetic field,
corresponds to the Iroshnikov-Kraichnan scaling of the spectrum. This is in
good agreement with recent numerical results.",2005-03-02T20:53:12Z
"Evidence of polarisation in the prompt gamma-ray emission from GRB
  930131 and GRB 960924","The true nature of the progenitor to GRBs remains elusive; one characteristic
that would constrain our understanding of the GRB mechanism considerably is
gamma-ray polarimetry measurements of the initial burst flux. We present a
method that interprets the prompt GRB flux as it Compton scatters off the
Earth's atmosphere, based on detailed modelling of both the Earth's atmosphere
and the orbiting detectors. The BATSE mission aboard the \textit{CGRO}
monitored the whole sky in the 20 keV - 1 MeV energy band continuously from
April 1991 until June 2000. We present the BATSE Albedo Polarimetry System
(BAPS), and show that GRB 930131 and GRB 960924 provide evidence of
polarisation in their prompt flux that is consistent with degrees of
polarisation of $\Pi>35$% and $\Pi>50$% respectively. While the evidence of
polarisation is strong, the method is unable to strongly constrain the degree
of polarisation beyond a systematics based estimation. Hence the implications
on GRB theory are unclear, and further measurements essential.",2005-05-05T14:02:32Z
The Space Density of Moderate Luminosity Active Galaxies at z=3,"We present an estimate of the space density of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)
at z=3. Combining deep X-ray data with Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG)
colour-selection in the rest-frame UV makes for highly efficient identification
of AGN in a narrow redshift range (z~2.5-3.5). Using Chandra data from the
Groth-Westphal Strip and the Hubble Deep Field North, we find a total of 15
X-ray detected LBGs at z~3, the majority of which are unlikely to have been
identified in blanket followup surveys of X-ray detected objects. We find the
comoving space density of moderate luminosity AGN at z=3 to be a factor ~10
higher than the most powerful objects. The available data are consistent with a
roughly constant space density of MLAGN from z=0.5-3, and they are also
consistent with a mild decline in the space density above z=1 as predicted by
the luminosity-dependent density evolution models of Ueda et al. (2003). This
strong AGN activity at z=3 argues against previous suggestions that the
majority of black hole accretion occurs at low redshift. A further implication
of our investigation is that, as far as can be determined from current data,
the majority of the AGN population at z~3 are selected by the LBG dropout
technique. Although this is sensitive to AGN with a UV-excess due to an
accretion disk, it predominantly identifies star-forming galaxies. A
significant fraction of X-ray sources seem likely to be hosted by these more
typical LBGs, further strengthening the starburst-AGN connection at high
redshift.",2005-03-23T09:40:20Z
The open cluster NGC 6520 and the nearby dark molecular cloud Barnard 86,"Wide field BVI photometry and $^{12}$CO(1$\to$0) observations are presen ted
in the region of the open cluster NGC 6520 and the dark molecular cloud
Barnard~86. From the analysis of the optical data we find that the cluster is
rather compact, with a radius of 1.0$\pm$0.5 arcmin, smaller than previous
estimates. The cluster age is 150$\pm$50 Myr and the reddening
E$_{B-V}$=0.42$\pm$0.10. The distance from the Sun is estimated to be
1900$\pm$100 pc, and it is larger than previous estimates. We finally derive
basic properties of the dark nebula Barnard 86 on the assumption that it lies
at the same distance of the cluster.",2005-04-20T12:50:02Z
"State transition and flaring activity of IGR J17464-3213/H1743-322 with
  SPI/INTEGRAL telescope","IGR J17464-3213, already known as the HEAO-1 transient source H1743-322, has
been detected during a state transition by the SPI/INTEGRAL telescope. We
describe the spectral evolution and flaring activity of IGR
J17464-3213/H1743-322 from 2003 March 21 to 2003 April 22. During the first
part, the source followed a continuous spectral softening, with the peak of the
spectral energy distribution shifting from 100 keV down to a few keV. However
the thermal disk and the hard X-ray components had a similar intensity,
indicating that the source was in an intermediate state throughout our
observations and evolving toward the soft state. In the second part of our
observations, the ASM/RXTE and SPI/INTEGRAL light curve showed a strong flaring
activity. Two flare events lasting about 1 day each have been detected with SPI
and are probably due to instabilities in the accretion disk associated with the
state transition. During these flares, the low (1.5-12 keV) and high (20-200
keV) energy fluxes monitored with ASM/RXTE and SPI/INTEGRAL, are correlated and
the spectral shape (above 20 keV) remains unchanged while the luminosity
increases by a factor greater than 2.",2005-05-19T15:05:38Z
"A Neutral Hydrogen Survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud: Aperture
  Synthesis and Multibeam Data Combined","Using a Fourier-plane technique, we have merged HI ATCA and Parkes data sets
providing an accurate set of images of the LMC sensitive to structure on scales
of 15 pc (for an LMC distance of 55 kpc) upwards. The spatial dynamic range
(2.8 orders of magnitude), velocity resolution (1.649 km/s), brightness
temperature sensitivity (2.4 K) and column density sensitivity ($8.9 \times 10^
{18}$ cm$^{-2}$ per 1.649 km/s channel) allow for the studies of phenomena
ranging from the galaxy-wide interaction of the LMC with its close neighbours
to the small-scale injection of energy from supernovae and stellar associations
into the ISM of the LMC. We find that a previous analysis of the holes and
shells (Kim et al. 1999) in the HI distribution shows the same power- law
behavior with that of clumps. The measured perimeter P and measured enclosed
area A of each HI cloud in a log-log plot give us a set of points lying along
with a slope of D/2 = 0.73 $\pm$ 0.1. The relation between area and perimeter
of each identified HI cloud, P $\propto$ $A^{D/2}$, can determine the fractal
dimension D=1.47 $\pm$ 0.2 of a cloud boundary (Vogelaar & Wakker 1994;
Williams, Blitz, & McKee 2000). The measured fractal dimension of HI clouds in
the LMC is similar to the dimension, D=1.4, found in many studies of the
molecular ISM.",2005-06-10T02:17:00Z
A non-main-sequence secondary in SY Cancri,"Simultaneous spectroscopic and photometric observations of the Z Cam type
dwarf nova SY Cancri were used to obtain absolute flux calibrations. A
comparison of the photometric calibration with a wide slit spectrophotometric
calibration showed that either method is equally satisfactory. A radial
velocity study of the secondary star, made using the far red NaI doublet,
yielded a mass ratio q = 0.68; this is very different from the value of 1.13
quoted in the literature. Using the new lower mass ratio, and constraining the
mass of the white dwarf to be within reasonable limits, then leads to a mass
for the secondary star that is substantially less than would be expected for
its orbital period if it satisfied a main-sequence mass-radius relationship. We
find a spectral type of M0 that is consistent with that expected for a
main-sequence star of the low mass we have found. However, in order to fill its
Roche lobe, the secondary must be significantly larger than a main sequence
star of that mass and spectral type. The secondary is definitely not a normal
main-sequence star.",2005-06-03T14:08:02Z
"Fast electron slowing-down and diffusion in a high temperature coronal
  X-ray source","Finite thermal velocity modifications to electron slowing-down rates may be
important for the deduction of solar flare total electron energy. Here we treat
both slowing-down and velocity diffusion of electrons in the corona at flare
temperatures, for the case of a simple, spatially homogeneous source. Including
velocity diffusion yields a consistent treatment of both `accelerated' and
`thermal' electrons. It also emphasises that one may not invoke finite thermal
velocity target effects on electron lifetimes without simultaneously treating
the contribution to the observed X-ray spectrum from thermal electrons. We
present model calculations of the X-ray spectra resulting from injection of a
power-law energy distribution of electrons into a source with finite
temperature. Reducing the power-law distribution low-energy cutoff to lower and
lower energies only increases the relative magnitude of the thermal component
of the spectrum, because the lowest energy electrons simply join the background
thermal distribution. Acceptable fits to RHESSI flare data are obtained using
this model. These also demonstrate, however, that observed spectra may in
consequence be acceptably consistent with rather a wide range of injected
electron parameters.",2005-05-10T15:01:17Z
Iron Needles in Supernova Remnants?,"It has been suggested by Dwek (2004) that iron needles could explain the
submillimetre emission from the Cas A supernova remnant (SNR) with only a very
small total mass. We investigate whether a similar model holds for the Kepler
supernova remnant, and find that its emission could indeed be explained by a
dust mass of less than 10^-2 M_sun dependent on the axial ratio (l/a) of the
needles - which we constrain to be less than 700. But the implied needle model
for Kepler is inconsistent with that suggested for Cas A since either the
needles would have to have a resistivity one or two orders of magnitude greater
than those in Cas A or the electron density in Kepler's shocked plasma must be
40 times greater than suggested by X-ray observations. An additional problem
with the needle model is that the implied thickness of the needles seems to be
implausibly small, if the emission properties are calculated under the usual
approximations.",2005-05-27T15:00:07Z
"Quantifying orbital migration from exoplanet statistics and host
  metallicities","We investigate how the statistical distribution of extrasolar planets may be
combined with knowledge of the host stars' metallicity to yield constraints on
the migration histories of gas giant planets. At any radius, planets that
barely manage to form around the lowest metallicity stars accrete their
envelopes just as the gas disk is being dissipated, so the lower envelope of
planets in a plot of metallicity vs semi-major axis defines a sample of
non-migratory planets that will have suffered less than average migration
subsequent to gap opening. Under the assumption that metallicity largely
controls the initial surface density of planetesimals, we use simplified core
accretion models to calculate how the minimum metallicity needed for planet
formation varies as a function of semi-major axis. Models that do not include
core migration prior to gap opening (Type I migration) predict that the
critical metallicity is largely flat between the snow line and a semimajor axis
of about 6 AU, with a weak dependence on the initial surface density profile of
planetesimals. When slow Type I migration is included, the critical metallicity
is found to increase steadily from 1-10 AU. Large planet samples, that include
planets at modestly greater orbital radii than present surveys, therefore have
the potential to quantify the extent of migration in both Type I and Type II
regimes.",2005-05-30T20:00:17Z
The Dynamics of Radiative Shock Waves: Linear and Nonlinear Evolution,"The stability properties of one-dimensional radiative shocks with a power-law
cooling function of the form $\Lambda \propto \rho^2T^\alpha$ are the main
subject of this work. The linear analysis originally presented by Chevalier &
Imamura, is thoroughfully reviewed for several values of the cooling index
$\alpha$ and higher overtone modes. Consistently with previous results, it is
shown that the spectrum of the linear operator consists in a series of modes
with increasing oscillation frequency. For each mode a critical value of the
cooling index, $\alpha_\textrm{c}$, can be defined so that modes with $\alpha <
\alpha_\textrm{c}$ are unstable, while modes with $\alpha > \alpha_\textrm{c}$
are stable. The perturbative analysis is complemented by several numerical
simulations to follow the time-dependent evolution of the system for different
values of $\alpha$. Particular attention is given to the comparison between
numerical and analytical results (during the early phases of the evolution) and
to the role played by different boundary conditions. It is shown that an
appropriate treatment of the lower boundary yields results that closely follow
the predicted linear behavior. During the nonlinear regime, the shock
oscillations saturate at a finite amplitude and tend to a quasi-periodic cycle.
The modes of oscillations during this phase do not necessarily coincide with
those predicted by linear theory, but may be accounted for by mode-mode
coupling.",2005-05-02T15:16:14Z
"Effects of Cosmological Magnetic Helicity on the Cosmic Microwave
  Background","Cosmological magnetic fields induce temperature and polarization fluctuations
in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. A cosmological magnetic
field with current amplitude of order $10^{-9}$ G is detectable via
observations of CMB anisotropies. This magnetic field (with or without
helicity) generates vector perturbations through vortical motions of the
primordial plasma. This paper shows that magnetic field helicity induces
parity-odd cross correlations between CMB temperature and $B$-polarization
fluctuations and between $E$- and $B$-polarization fluctuations, correlations
which are zero for fields with no helicity (or for any parity-invariant
source). Helical fields also contribute to parity-even temperature and
polarization anisotropies, cancelling part of the contribution from the
symmetric component of the magnetic field. We give analytic approximations for
all CMB temperature and polarization anisotropy vector power spectra due to
helical magnetic fields. These power spectra offer a method for detecting
cosmological helical magnetic fields, particularly when combined with Faraday
rotation measurements which are insensitive to helicity.",2005-03-31T19:23:01Z

The Afterglows of Ultraluminous Quasars,"Quasars represent a brief phase in the life-cycle of most massive galaxies,
but the evolutionary connection between central black holes and their host
galaxies remains unclear. While quasars are active and shining brighter than
the Compton-limit luminosity, their radiation heats the surrounding medium to
the Compton temperature, forming Compton spheres extending to the Str\""omgren
radius of Fe$^{26+}$/He$^{2+}$. After the quasars shut off, their ``afterglow''
can be detected through three signatures: (1) an extended X-ray envelope, with
a characteristic temperature of $\sim 3\times 10^7$ K; (2) Ly$\alpha$ and
Ly$\beta$ lines and the $K-$edge of Fe$^{26+}$; and (3) nebulosity from
hydrogen and helium recombination emission lines. We discuss the possibility of
detecting these signatures using {\em Chandra}, the planned {\em XEUS} mission,
and ground-based optical telescopes. The luminosity and size of quasar
afterglows can be used to constrain the lifetime of quasars.",2005-04-14T01:04:32Z
"Mass-loss and Recent Spectral Changes in the Yellow Hypergiant Rho
  Cassiopeiae","The yellow hypergiant Rho Cassiopeiae (F-G Ia0) has recently become very
active with a tremendous outburst event in the fall of 2000. During the event
the pulsating supergiant dimmed by more than a visual magnitude, while its
effective temperature decreased from 7000 K to below 4000 K over about 200 d,
and we directly observed the largest mass-loss rate of about 5% of the solar
mass in a single stellar outburst so far. Over the past three years since the
eruption we observed a very prominent inverse P Cygni profile in Balmer H
alpha, signaling a strong collapse of the upper atmosphere, also observed
before the 2000 event. Continuous spectroscopic monitoring reveals that the H
alpha line profile has transformed into a P Cygni profile since June 2003,
presently (Sept 2004) signaling supersonic expansion velocities up to ~120 km/s
in the extended upper atmosphere.
  Based on the very recent unique spectral evolution we observed the far-UV
spectrum with the FUSE satellite in July 2004. The FUSE spectrum reveals that
high-temperature plasma emission lines of O VI and C III are absent in the
hypergiant, also observed for the red supergiant Alpha Ori (M2 Iab). On the
other hand, we observe prominent transition region emission lines in the
smaller (less luminous) classical Cepheid variable Beta Dor (F-G Iab-Ia),
indicating that the mean atmospheric extension and surface gravity acceleration
(as compared to effective temperature and atmospheric pulsation) play a major
role for the formation of high-temperature stellar atmospheric plasmas. We
present an overview of the recent spectral variability phases of Rho Cas with
enhanced mass-loss from this enigmatic cool star.",2005-04-24T01:54:24Z
Neural networks for gamma-hadron separation in MAGIC,"Neural networks have proved to be versatile and robust for particle
separation in many experiments related to particle astrophysics. We apply these
techniques to separate gamma rays from hadrons for the MAGIC Cerenkov
Telescope. Two types of neural network architectures have been used for the
classi cation task: one is the MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) based on supervised
learning, and the other is the Self-Organising Tree Algorithm (SOTA), which is
based on unsupervised learning. We propose a new architecture by combining
these two neural networks types to yield better and faster classi cation
results for our classi cation problem.",2005-03-24T14:46:32Z
"Comments on ""Angular Momentum Transport in Quasi-Keplerian Accretion
  Disks""","Subramanian, Pujari and Becker (2004) claim that the correct expression for
the angular momentum transport in an accretion disc, which is proportional to
dOmega/dR, can be derived on the basis of the analysis of the epicyclic motion
of gas parcels in adjacent eddies in the disc. We study their argument and show
that their derivation contains several fundamental errors: 1) the biased choice
of the desired formula from an infinite number of formulae; 2) the biased
choice of parcel trajectories; and 3) confusion regarding the reference frames.
Following 1) we could derive, for example, a (invalid) formula in which the
angular momentum transport is proportional to dv_phi/dR, and from 2) we could
even prove that the angular momentum transport is either inward or null. We
present the correct approach to the problem of angular momentum transport in an
accretion disc in terms of mean free path theory.",2005-05-23T04:03:33Z
Toward an understanding of the periastron puzzle of PSR B1259-63,"Efforts are made to understand the timing behaviors (e.g., the jumps of the
projected pulsar semimajor axis in the periastron passages) observed via
13-year timing for PSR B1259-63. In the first, planet-like objects are
suggested to orbit around the Be star, which may gravitationally perturb the
(probably low mass) pulsar when it passes through periastron. Second, an
accretion disk should exist outside the pulsar's light cylinder, which creates
a spindown torque on the pulsar due to the propeller effect. The observed
negative braking index and the discrepant timing residuals close to periastron
could be relevant to the existence of the disk with varying accretion rates.
Third, a speculation is presented that the accretion rate may increase on a
long timescale in order to explain the negative braking index.",2005-02-19T14:50:03Z
BeppoSAX/PDS serendipitous detections at high galactic latitudes,"At a flux limit of ~10^(-11) erg/cm2/s in the 20-100 keV band, the PDS
instrument on-board BeppoSAX offers the opportunity to study the extragalactic
sky with an unprecedented sensitivity. In this work we report on the results of
a search in the BeppoSAX archive for serendipitous high energy sources at high
galactic latitudes (|b| > 13 deg). We have defined a set of twelve regions in
which the PDS/MECS cross-calibration constant is higher than the nominal value.
We attribute this mismatch to the presence of a serendipitous source in the PDS
field of view.In four cases the likely high energy emitter is also present in
the MECS field of view. In these cases, we have performed a broad band spectral
analysis (1.5-100 keV) so as to understand the source spectral behaviour and
compare it with previous BeppoSAX observations when available. In eight cases
the identification of the source likely to provide the PDS spectrum is based on
indirect evidence (extrapolation to lower energies and/or comparison to
previous observations). This approach leads to the discovery of six new hard
X-ray emitting objects (PKS 2356-611, 2MASX J14585116-1652223, NGC 1566, NGC
7319, PKS 0101-649 and ESO 025-G002) and to the presentation the PDS spectrum
of NGC 3227 for the first time. In the remaining five cases we provide extra

"Kinematics, ages and metallicities for F and G type stars in the solar
  neighbourhood","A new metallicity distribution and an age-metallicity relation are presented
for 437 nearby F and G turn-off and sub-giant stars selected from radial
velocity data of Nidever et al. Photometric metallicities are derived from
uvby-H\beta photometry, and the stellar ages from the isochrones of Bergbusch &
VandenBerg as transformed to $uvby$ photometry using the methods of Clem et al.
The X (stellar-population) criterion of Schuster et al., which combines both
kinematic and metallicity information, provides 22 thick-disk stars.
\sigma_{\rm W} = 32 \pm 5 km s^{-1}, <V_{\rm rot}> = 154 \pm 6 km s^{-1} and
<[M/H]> = -0.55 \pm 0.03 dex for these thick-disk stars, which is in agreement
with values from previous studies of the thick disk. \alpha -element abundances
which are available for some of these thick-disk stars show the typical
alpha-element signatures of the thick disk, supporting the classification
procedure based on the $X$ criteria. Both the scatter in metallicity at a given
age and the presence of old, metal-rich stars in the age-metallicity relation
make it difficult to decide whether or not an age-metallicity relation exists
for the older thin-disk stars. For ages greater than 3 Gyr, our results agree
with the other recent studies that there is almost no correlation between age
and metallicity, \Delta ([M/Fe])/\Delta(age) = -0.01 \pm 0.005 dex Gyr^{-1}.
For the 22 thick-disk stars there is a range in ages of 7-8 Gyr, but again
almost no correlation between age and metallicity.",2005-04-14T09:56:38Z
"From Dusty Filaments to Cores to Stars: An Infrared Extinction Study of
  Lupus 3","We present deep NIR observations of a dense region of Lupus 3 obtained with
ESO's NTT and VLT. Using the NICE method we construct a dust extinction map of
the cloud, which reveals embedded globules, a dense filament, and a dense ring
structure. We derive dust column densities and masses for the entire cloud and
for the individual structures therein. We construct radial extinction profiles
for the embedded globules and find a range of profile shapes from relatively
shallow profiles for cores with low peak extinctions, to relatively steep
profiles for cores with high extinction. Overall the profiles are similar to
those of pressure truncated isothermal spheres of varying center-to-edge
density contrast. We apply Bonnor-Ebert analysis to compare the density
profiles of the embedded cores in a quantitative manner and derive physical
parameters such as temperatures, central densities, and external pressures. We
examine the stability of the cores and find that two cores are likely stable
and two are likely unstable. One of these latter cores is known to harbor an
active protostar. Finally, we discuss the relation between an emerging cluster
in Lupus 3 and the ring structure identified in our extinction map. Assuming
that the ring is the remnant of the core within which the cluster originally
formed we estimate that a star formation efficiency of ~ 30% characterized the
formation of the small cluster. Our observations of Lupus 3 suggest an intimate
link between the structure of a dense core and its state of star forming
activity. The dense cores are found to span the entire range of evolution from
a stable, starless core of modest central concentration, to an unstable,
star-forming core which is highly centrally concentrated, to a significantly
disrupted core from which a cluster of young stars is emerging.",2005-04-21T21:37:15Z
X-ray States of Black Hole Binaries in Outburst,"A brief review is given for X-ray properties of black hole binary systems.
Topics include the effort to re-define the three states of active accretion,
potential applications for general relativity in the regime of strong gravity,
and the properties of high-frequency QPOs in 7 systems.",2005-04-05T20:04:48Z
The Correlation of Metallicity Gradient with Galaxy Mass,"A number of previous studies have searched for a correlation between radial
metallicity gradients and early-type galaxy mass -- no convincing trends have
been found. Here we re-examine this issue with several key enhancements: using
total metallicity from studies that have broken the age-metallicity degeneracy,
excluding galaxies with young stellar ages (i.e. tho se that have experienced a
recent central starburst) and using the K-band to derive galaxy luminosities.
We find that Coma cluster galaxies have metallicity gradients which correlate
with galaxy mass. Furthermore, gradients have values similar to those of
monolithic collapse models. The combination of dissipative formation and energy
injection from supernova provides a mechanism for the trends with galaxy mass,
however other explanations are possible. Additional high quality observational
data is needed to further constrain the gas physics involved in galaxy
formation.",2005-04-18T06:14:09Z
"PPPM and TreePM Methods on GRAPE Systems for Cosmological N-body
  Simulations","We present Particle-Particle-Particle-Mesh (PPPM) and Tree Particle-Mesh
(TreePM) implementations on GRAPE-5 and GRAPE-6A systems, special-purpose
hardware accelerators for gravitational many-body simulations. In our PPPM and
TreePM implementations on GRAPE, the computational time is significantly
reduced compared with the conventional implementations without GRAPE,
especially under the strong particle clustering, and almost constant
irrespective of the degree of particle clustering. We carry out the survey of
two simulation parameters, the PM grid spacing and the opening parameter for
the most optimal combination of force accuracy and computational speed. We also
describe the parallelization of these implementations on a PC-GRAPE cluster, in
which each node has one GRAPE board, and present the optimal configuration of
simulation parameters for good parallel scalability.",2005-04-05T01:52:59Z
A Library of Integrated Spectra of Galactic Globular Clusters,"We present a new library of integrated spectra of 40 Galactic globular
clusters, obtained with the Blanco 4-m telescope and the R-C spectrograph at
the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory. The spectra cover the range ~ 3350
-- 6430 A with ~ 3.1 A (FWHM) resolution. The spectroscopic observations and
data reduction were designed to integrate the full projected area within the
cluster core radii in order to properly sample the light from stars in all
relevant evolutionary stages. The S/N values of the flux-calibrated spectra
range from 50 to 240/A at 4000 A and from 125 to 500/A at 5000 A. The selected
targets span a wide range of cluster parameters, including metallicity,
horizontal-branch morphology, Galactic coordinates, Galactocentric distance,
and concentration. The total sample is thus fairly representative of the entire
Galactic globular cluster population and should be valuable for comparison with
similar integrated spectra of unresolved stellar populations in remote systems.
For most of the library clusters, our spectra can be coupled with deep
color-magnitude diagrams and reliable metal abundances from the literature to
enable the calibration of stellar population synthesis models. In this paper we
present a detailed account of the observations and data reduction. The spectral
library is publicly available in electronic format from the National Optical
Astronomical Observatory website.",2005-04-14T14:01:35Z
"XMM-Newton observations of two transient millisecond X-ray pulsars in
  quiescence","We report on XMM-Newton observations of two X-ray transient millisecond
pulsars (XRTMSPs). We detected XTE J0929-314 with an unabsorbed luminosity of
\~7x10^{31} erg/s. (0.5-10 keV) at a fiducial distance of 10 kpc. The quiescent
spectrum is consistent with a simple power law spectrum. The upper limit on the
flux from a cooling neutron star atmosphere is about 20% of the total flux. XTE
J1807-294 instead was not detected. We can put an upper limit on the source
quiescent 0.5-10 keV unabsorbed luminosity <4x10^{31} erg/s at 8 kpc. These
observations strenghten the idea that XRTMSPs have quiescent luminosities
significantly lower than classical neutron star transients.",2005-03-24T11:49:02Z
Massive Young Stellar Objects in high-mass star-forming regions,"High-quality K-band spectra of point sources, deeply embedded in massive
star-forming regions, have revealed a population of 20 young massive stars
showing no photospheric absorption lines, but only emission lines. The K-band
spectra exhibit one or more features commonly associated with massive Young
Stellar Objects surrounded by circumstellar material: a very red color (J-K) =
2, CO bandhead emission, hydrogen emission lines (sometimes doubly peaked), and
FeII and/or MgII emission lines. The CO emission comes from a relatively dense
(~10^10 cm^(-3)) and hot (T ~ 2000-5000 K) region, sufficiently shielded from
the intense UV radiation field of the young massive star. Modeling of the
CO-first overtone emission shows that the CO gas is located within 5 AU of the
star. The hydrogen emission is produced in an ionized medium exposed to UV
radiation. The best geometrical configuration is a dense and neutral
circumstellar disk causing the CO bandhead emission, and an ionized upper layer
where the hydrogen lines are produced. We argue that the circumstellar disk is
likely a remnant of the accretion via a circumstellar disk.",2005-06-14T12:23:10Z
"Fluctuating annihilation cross sections and the generation of density
  perturbations","Fluctuations in the mass and decay rate of a heavy particle which for some
period dominates the energy density of the universe are known to lead to
adiabatic density perturbations. We show that generically the annihilation
cross section of the same particle also receives fluctuations, which leads to
entropy perturbations at freeze-out. If the particle comes to dominate the
energy density of the universe and subsequently decays, this leads to an
additional source of adiabatic density perturbations. On the other hand,
non-adiabatic density perturbations result when the particle does not decay but
contributes to the observed dark matter.",2005-02-07T20:08:50Z
"Towards an Understanding of the Physical Nature of MgII Absorption
  Systems","We discuss issues concerning the physical nature of intervening MgII quasar
absorption systems in light of results from our recent surveys using SDSS EDR
QSO spectra and data obtained at the MMT. These surveys indicate an excess of
weak $W_0^{\lambda2796} \lesssim 0.3$\AA) systems relative to the exponential
dN/dW distribution of stronger systems. The incidence of intermediate-strength
lines shows remarkably little evolution with redshift, thereby constraining
models for the nature of the clouds comprising these absorbers. The total
distribution does evolve, with the incidence decreasing with decreasing
redshift in a $W_0^{\lambda2796}$-dependent rate (the strongest systems evolve
the fastest). This suggests that multiple populations that evolve at different
rates contribute to the incidence in a $W_0^{\lambda2796}$-dependent manner. We
also present two images of fields containing unprecedented ``ultra-strong''
($W_0^{\lambda2796} \ge 4.0$\AA) MgII absorbers.",2005-05-06T19:26:51Z
"Wavelet transform and diffusion equations: applications to the
  processing of the ""Cassini"" spacecraft observations","We show that continuous transform with the complex Morlet wavelet is easily
performed if we replace the integration of the fast-oscillation function by the
solution of the diffusion differential equations. The most important advantage
of this approach is that the initial data can be represented by non-uniform
sample of an arbitrary node number. We apply the proposed method to the
processing of the image of the Saturn A-ring obtained from the Cassini
spacecraft. Also we have got via the wavelet transform using PDE, the local
correlation coefficient of the signal and the harmonic function.",2005-02-18T15:03:31Z
Present and Future Prospects for GRB Standard Candles,"Following our previous work, we conclude that a GRB standard candle
constructed from the Ghirlanda et al. power-law relation between the
geometry-corrected energy (E_gamma) and the peak of the rest-frame prompt burst
spectrum (E_p) is not yet cosmographically useful, despite holding some
potential advantages over SNe Ia. This is due largely to the small sample of
\~20 GRBs with the required measured redshifts, jet-breaks, and peak energies,
and to the strong sensitivity of the goodness-of-fit of the power-law to input
assumptions. The most important such finding concerns the sensitivity to the
generally unknown density (and density profile), of the circumburst medium.
Although the E_p-E_gamma relation is a highly significant correlation over many
cosmologies, until the sample expands to include many low-z events, it will be
most sensitive to Omega_M but essentially insensitive to Omega_Lambda and w,
with some hope of constraining dw/dt with high-z GRB data alone. The relation
clearly represents a significant improvement in the search for an empirical GRB
standard candle, but is further hindered by an unknown physical basis for the
relation, the lack of a low-z training set to calibrate the relation in a
cosmology-independent way, and several major potential systematic uncertainties
and selection effects. Until these concerns are addressed, a larger sample is
acquired, and attempts are made to marginalize or perform Monte Carlo
simulations over the unknown density distribution, we urge caution concerning
claims of the utility of GRBs for cosmography and especially the attempts to
combine GRBs with SNe Ia.",2005-02-27T00:08:32Z
Pulsar shadow as the origin of double notches in radio pulse profiles,"We present the model of eclipsing a rotating, spatially extended source of
directional emission by a central absorber, and apply it to the pulsar
magnetosphere. The model assumes the radially extended inward radio emission
along the local direction of the magnetic field, and the pulsar as the
absorber. The geometry of the magnetic field lines of the rotating dipole is
favourable for the double eclipse events, which we identify with the double
notches observed in pulse profiles of nearby pulsars. For pulsars with large
dipole inclinations 70 <~ alpha <~ 110 deg the double notches are predicted to
occur within a narrow phase range of 20 to 30 deg before the main radio peak.
Application of the model to PSR B0950+08 establishes it as a nearly orthogonal
rotator (alpha =~ 75 deg, beta =~ -10 deg) with many pulse components naturally
interpreted in terms of the inward radio emission from a large range of
altitudes. The inward components include the intermittently strong, leading
component of the main pulse, which would traditionally have been interpeted as
a conal emission in the outward direction. The model also identifies the
magnetic field lines along which the radially extended inward radio emission
occurs in B0950+08. These have a narrow range of the footprint parameter s
close to 1.1 (closed field line region, near the last open field lines). We
describe directional characteristics of inward emission from the radially
extended region and compare them with characteristics of extended outward
emission. Our work shows that pulse profiles of at least some pulsars may be a
superposition of both inward and outward emission.",2005-03-18T12:22:31Z
The Beaming Factor and Other Open Questions In GRB Jets,"I review several central open questions concerning GRB Jets. 1) I discuss a
new estimates of the beaming correction for the rate of GRBs ~ 75 +- 20. 2) I
discuss the universal structured jet (USJ) model and conclude that while jets
might be structured they are less likely to be universal. 3) I discuss recent
observations of a sideways expansion of a GRB afterglow and compare these with
current hydrodynamics simulations of jet evolution. 4) I discuss the
implications of resent outliers to the energy-angle relation.",2005-02-23T02:32:44Z
"Total Galaxy Magnitudes and Effective Radii from Petrosian Magnitudes
  and Radii","Petrosian magnitudes were designed to help with the difficult task of
determining a galaxy's total light. Although these magnitudes (taken here as
the flux within 2R_P, with the inverted Petrosian index 1/eta(R_P)=0.2) can
represent most of an object's flux, they do of course miss the light outside of
the Petrosian aperture (2R_P). The size of this flux deficit varies
monotonically with the shape of a galaxy's light-profile, i.e., its
concentration. In the case of a de Vaucouleurs R^{1/4} profile, the deficit is
0.20 mag; for an R^{1/8} profile this figure rises to 0.50 mag. Here we provide
a simple method for recovering total (Sersic) magnitudes from Petrosian
magnitudes using only the galaxy concentration (R_90/R_50 or R_80/R_20) within
the Petrosian aperture. The corrections hold to the extent that Sersic's model
provides a good description of a galaxy's luminosity profile. We show how the
concentration can also be used to convert Petrosian radii into effective
half-light radii, enabling a robust measure of the mean effective surface
brightness. Our technique is applied to the SDSS DR2 Petrosian parameters,
yielding good agreement with the total magnitudes, effective radii, and mean
effective surface brightnesses obtained from the NYU--VAGC Sersic R^{1/n} fits
by Blanton et al. (2005). Although the corrective procedure described here is
specifically applicable to the SDSS DR2 and DR3, it is generally applicable to
all imaging data where any Petrosian index and concentration can be
constructed.",2005-04-13T05:28:07Z
"On the Steady Nature of Line-Driven Disk Winds: Application to
  Cataclysmic Variables","We apply the semi-analytical analysis of the steady nature of line-driven
winds presented in two earlier papers to disk winds driven by the flux
distribution of a standard Shakura & Sunyaev (1973) disk for typical
cataclysmic variable (CV) parameters. We find that the wind critical point
tends to be closer to the disk surface towards the inner disk regions. Our main
conclusion, however, is that a line-driven wind, arising from a steady disk
flux distribution of a standard Shakura-Sunyaev disk capable of locally
supplying the corresponding mass flow, is steady. These results confirm the
findings of an earlier paper that studied ""simple"" flux distributions that are
more readily analyzable than those presented here. These results are consistent
with the steady velocity nature of outflows observationally inferred for both
CVs and quasi-stellar objects (QSOs). We find good agreement with the 2.5D CV
disk wind models of Pereyra and collaborators. These results suggest that the
likely scenario to account for the wind outflows commonly observed in CVs is
the line-driven accretion disk wind scenario, as suggested early-on by Cordova
& Mason (1982). For QSOs, these results show that the line-driven accretion
disk wind continues to be a promising scenario to account for the outflows
detected in broad absorption line (BAL) QSOs, as suggested early-on by Turnshek
(1984), and analyzed in detail by Murray et al. (1995).",2005-06-01T03:57:50Z
"Emission-line spectroscopy of Damped Lyman Alpha Systems: The case of
  SBS 1543+593/HS 1543+5921","We report HST/STIS spectroscopy and Gemini/GMOS-N imaging of the Damped Lyman
Alpha (DLA) system toward HS 1543+5921 caused by the host star-forming galaxy
(SFG) SBS 1543+593. The Gemini image shows new morphological details of this
well resolved DLA galaxy. In combination with previous optical spectra, the new
UV spectra enable us to compare for the first time, ionized and neutral
gas-phase alpha-element abundances derived from emission- and absorption-line
spectroscopy, in a bona fide DLA galaxy. The abundances we determine using
emission-line diagnostics agree with those from absorption-line diagnostics. We
present our results on a metallicity versus redshift diagram that combines
local HII regions and SFGs with high-redshift DLAs, and discuss implications
for the chemical evolution of galaxies.",2005-04-25T19:55:30Z
The interaction of a jet-like pulse with a wind from a stellar companion,"We present numerical simulations of the interaction between a collimated,
bipolar ``pulse'' ejected from a star and a continuous wind ejected from a
stellar companion. We explore the characteristics of the predicted H$\alpha$
intensity maps by varying selected input parameters. We find that the asymmetry
(in size and strength) between the two lobes of the proto-planetary nebula OH
231.8+4.2 is reproduced in this scenario if the wind ejected by the companion
star has a strong latitude dependence.",2005-03-01T15:07:56Z
"Using radio emission to detect isolated and quiescent accreting black
  holes","We discuss the implications of new relations between black holes' masses,
X-ray luminosities and radio luminosities, as well as the properties of the
next generation of radio telescopes, for the goal of finding isolated accreting
black holes. Because accreting black holes have radio-to-X-ray flux ratios that
increase with decreasing luminosity in Eddington units, and because deep
surveys over large fields of view should be possible with planned
instrumentation such as LOFAR, radio surveys should be significantly more
efficient than X-ray surveys for finding these objects.",2005-03-04T13:23:10Z
"Multi-seeded multi-mode formation of embedded clusters in the RMC:
  Clusters baked in swept-up shells","This is the first of a series of three papers on clustered star formation in
the Rosette Molecular Complex. Here we investigate star formation in the
interfacing layers between the expanding Rosette Nebula and its surrounding
cloud, based on an analysis of the spatially complete and unbiased 2MASS data.
Two medium-mass infrared clusters with ages of around 1 Myr are identified in
the south and south-east arcs of the fragmented shell. The majority of the
candidate cluster members in these radiation and pressure-confined regions are
found to be almost uniformly distributed, roughly following the compression
layers traced by the distribution of optical depth at 100 $\mu$m, and may well
develop into gravitationally unbound systems upon their emergence from the
parental cloud. These expanding shells are believed to be playing important
roles in impeding the emerging young open cluster NGC 2244 from intruding
immediately and deeply into the ambient molecular cloud, where sequential
formation of massive clusters is taking place.",2005-04-01T08:14:35Z
The Plerionic Supernova Remnant G21.5-0.9: In and Out,"The absence of a supernova remnant (SNR) shell surrounding the Crab and other
plerions (pulsar wind nebulae) has been a mystery for 3 decades. G21.5-0.9 is a
particularly intriguing plerionic SNR in which the central powering engine is
not yet detected. Early Chandra observations revealed a faint extended X-ray
halo which was suggested to be associated with the SNR shell; however its
spectrum was nonthermal, unlike what is expected from an SNR shell. On the
other hand, a plerionic origin to the halo is problematic since the X-ray
plerion would be larger than the radio plerion. We present here our analysis of
an integrated 245 ksec of archival Chandra data acquired with the
High-Resolution Camera (HRC) and 520 ksec acquired with the Advanced CCD
Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS). This study provides the deepest and highest
resolution images obtained to date. The resulting images reveal for the first
time 1) a limb-brightened morphology in the eastern section of the halo, and 2)
a rich structure in the inner (40""-radius) bright plerion including wisps and a
double-lobed morphology with an axis of symmetry running in the
northwest-southeast direction. Our spatially resolved spectroscopic study of
the ACIS-I data indicates that the photon index steepens with increasing
distance from the central point source out to a radius of 40"" then becomes
constant at ~2.4 in the X-ray halo (for a column density N_H=2.2E22/cm^2). No
line emission was found from the eastern limb; however marginal evidence for
line emission in the halo's northern knots was found. This study illustrates
the need for deep Chandra observations to reveal the missing SNR material in
Crab-like plerions.",2005-04-17T22:59:42Z
Lopsided spiral galaxies: evidence for gas accretion,"We quantify the degree of lopsidedness for a sample of 149 galaxies observed
in the near-infrared from the OSUBGS sample, and try to explain the physical
origin for the observed disk lopsidedness. We confirm previous studies, but now
for a larger sample, that a large fraction of galaxies show significant
lopsidedness in their stellar disks, measured as the Fourier amplitude of the
m=1 component, normalised to the average or m=0 component, in the surface
density. Late-type galaxies are found to be more lopsided, while the presence
of m=2 spiral arms and bars is correlated. The m=1 amplitude is found to be
uncorrelated with the tidal forces acting on a galaxy via nearby companions.
Numerical simulations are carried out to study the generation of m=1 via
different processes: galaxy tidal encounters, galaxy mergers, and external gas
accretion and subsequent star formation. The simulations show that galaxy
interactions and mergers can trigger strong lopsidedness, but do not explain
several independent statistical properties of observed galaxies. To explain all
the observational results, it is required that a large fraction of lopsidedness
results from cosmological accretion of gas on galactic disks, which can create
strongly lopsided disks when this accretion is asymmetrical enough.",2005-03-15T12:33:33Z
"Method of determining cosmological parameter ranges with samples of
  candles with an intrinsic distribution","In this paper, the effect of the intrinsic distribution of cosmological
candles is investigated. We find that, in the case of a narrow distribution,
the deviation of the observed modulus of sources from the expected central
value could be estimated within a ceratin range. We thus introduce a lower and
upper limits of $\chi ^{2}$, $\chi_{\min}^{2}$ and $ \chi_{\max}^{2}$, to
estimate cosmological parameters by applying the conventional minimizing $\chi
^{2}$ method. We apply this method to a gamma-ray burst (GRB) sample as well as
to a combined sample including this GRB sample and an SN Ia sample. Our
analysis shows that: a) in the case of assuming an intrinsic distribution of
candles of the GRB sample, the effect of the distribution is obvious and should
not be neglected; b) taking into account this effect would lead to a poorer
constraint of the cosmological parameter ranges. The analysis suggests that in
the attempt of constraining the cosmological model with current GRB samples,
the results tend to be worse than what previously thought if the mentioned
intrinsic distribution does exist.",2005-02-18T12:24:50Z
"Transrelativistic Synchrotron Emissivity, Cross-Section, and
  Polarization","The spectrum and polarization produced by particles spiraling in a magnetic
field undergo dramatic changes as the emitters transition from nonrelativistic
to relativistic energies. However, none of the currently available methods for
calculating the characteristics of this radiation field are adequate for the
purpose of sustaining accuracy and speed of computation in the intensity, and
none even attempt to provide a means of determining the polarization fraction
other than in the cyclotron or synchrotron limits. But the transrelativistic
regime, which we here find to lie between $5\times 10^7$ K and $5\times 10^9$ K
for a thermal plasma, is becoming increasingly important in high-energy
astrophysical environments, such as in the intra-cluster medium, and in the
accretion flows of supermassive black holes. In this paper, we present simple,
yet highly accurate, fitting formulae for the magnetobremsstrahlung (also known
as cyclo-synchrotron) emissivity, its polarization fraction (and content), and
the absorption cross-section. We demonstrate that both the harmonic and
high-energy limiting behavior are well represented, incurring at most an error
of $\sim 5%$ throughout the transition region.",2005-05-06T22:39:43Z
Magnetic Tower Outflows from a Radial Wire Array Z-pinch,"We present the first results of high energy density laboratory astrophysics
experiments which explore the evolution of collimated outflows and jets driven
by a toroidal magnetic field. The experiments are scalable to astrophysical
flows in that critical dimensionless numbers such as the Mach number, the
plasma beta and the magnetic Reynolds number are all in the astrophysically
appropriate ranges. Our experiments use the MAGPIE pulsed power machine and
allow us to explore the role of magnetic pressure in creating and collimating
the outflow as well as showing the creation of a central jet within the broader
outflow cavity. We show that currents flow along this jet and we observe its
collimation to be enhanced by the additional hoop stresses associated with the
generated toroidal field. Although at later times the jet column is observed to
go unstable, the jet retains its collimation. We also present simulations of
the magnetic jet evolution using our two-dimensional resistive
magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) laboratory code. We conclude with a discussion of
the astrophysical relevance of the experiments and of the stability properties
of the jet.",2005-05-02T15:11:19Z
The white dwarf cooling sequence in NGC 6791,"In the old, populous, and metal-rich open cluster NGC 6791 we have used deep
HST/ACS images to track the white dwarf cooling sequence down to m_F606W~28.5.
The white dwarf luminosity function shows a well defined peak at m_F606W~27.4,
and a bending to the blue in the color--magnitude diagram. If this peak
corresponds to the end of the white dwarf cooling sequence the comparison with
theoretical isochrones provides a cluster age estimate of ~2.4 Gyr, in sharp
contrast with the age of 8--9 Gyr inferred from the main-sequence turn-off. If
the end is at fainter magnitudes, the peak at m_F606W~27.4 is even more
enigmatic. We discuss possible causes, none of them very convincing.",2005-03-17T18:37:34Z
Silicon Tetrafluoride on Io,"Silicon tetrafluoride (SiF4) is observed in terrestrial volcanic gases and is
predicted to be the major F - bearing species in low temperature volcanic gases
on Io (Schaefer and Fegley, 2005b). SiF4 gas is also a potential indicator of
silica-rich crust on Io. We used F/S ratios in terrestrial and extraterrestrial
basalts, and gas/lava enrichment factors for F and S measured at terrestrial
volcanoes to calculate equilibrium SiF4/SO2 ratios in volcanic gases on Io. We
conclude that SiF4 can be produced at levels comparable to the observed
NaCl/SO2 gas ratio. We also considered potential loss processes for SiF4 in
volcanic plumes and in Io's atmosphere including ion-molecule reactions,
electron chemistry, photochemistry, reactions with the major atmospheric
constituents, and condensation. Photochemical destruction (tchem ~ 266 days)
and/or condensation as Na2SiF6 (s) appear to be the major sinks for SiF4. We
recommend searching for SiF4 with infrared spectroscopy using its 9.7 micron
band as done on Earth.",2005-06-01T20:21:32Z
"Nonthermal X-radiation of SNR RX J1713.7-3946: The Relations to a Nearby
  Molecular Cloud","The recent X-ray and CO observations of RX J1713.7-3946 show that a
significant fraction of the nonthermal X-ray emission of this unique supernova
remnant associates, in one way or another, with a molecular cloud interacting
with the west part of the shell. This adds a new puzzle in the origin of X-ray
emission which cannot be easily explained within the standard model in
accordance of which X-rays are result of synchrotron radiation of multi-TeV
electrons accelerated by supernova shock waves. We explore an alternative
origin of the X-ray emission assuming that it is produced by secondary
electrons resulting from high energy hadronic interactions in the molecular
gas. Such a scenario could explain in a quite natural way the apparent
correlation between the X-ray and CO morphologies. However, the TeV gamma-ray
emission recently reported by H.E.S.S. significantly constrains the parameter
space of this model. Namely, this mechanism cannot reproduce the bulk of the

Virtual Observatory: From Concept to Implementation,"We review the origins of the Virtual Observatory (VO) concept, and the
current status of the efforts in this field. VO is the response of the
astronomical community to the challenges posed by the modern massive and
complex data sets. It is a framework in which information technology is
harnessed to organize, maintain, and explore the rich information content of
the exponentially growing data sets, and to enable a qualitatively new science
to be done with them. VO will become a complete, open, distributed, web-based
framework for astronomy of the early 21st century. A number of significant
efforts worldwide are now striving to convert this vision into reality. The
technological and methodological challenges posed by the information-rich
astronomy are also common to many other fields. We see a fundamental change in
the way all science is done, driven by the information technology revolution.",2005-04-01T00:57:22Z
"Exceptional H_2 emission in the Antennae galaxies: Pre-starburst shocks
  from the galaxy collision","The collision of gas-rich galaxies is believed to produce strong shocks
between their gas clouds which cause the onset of the observed bursts of
extended star formation. However, the so far observed shock signatures in
colliding galaxies can be explained essentially by winds from already existing
massive stars and supernovae and thus do not give any evidence for an
outstanding pre-starburst phase. Either pre-starburst gas shocks are too
short-lived to be detected or one has to modify our perception of colliding
galaxies. A dedicated analysis of ISOCAM-CVF mid-infrared spectral maps led us
to the discovery of exceptional H_2 v=0-0 S(3) lambda = 9.66 um line emission
from the ""Antennae"" galaxy pair, which is at an early stage of galaxy
collision. Its H_2 line luminosity, normalized by the far-infrared luminosity,
exceeds that of all other known galaxies and the strongest H_2 emission is
spatially displaced from the known starbursts regions. This implies that most
of the excited H_2 gas in the Antennae must be shocked due to the collision of
the two galaxies. These observations indicate that the outstanding phase of
pre-starburst shocks exists, and that they might be a key to our understanding
of the formation of the first proto-galaxies.",2005-02-22T18:32:25Z
"Accretion of cool stellar winds on Sgr A*: another puzzle of the
  Galactic Centre?","Sgr A* is currently being fed by winds from a cluster of gravitationally
bound young mass-loosing stars. Using observational constraints on the orbits,
mass loss rates and wind velocities of these stars, we numerically model the
distribution of gas in the ~ 0.1--10'' region around Sgr A*. We find that
radiative cooling of recently discovered slow winds leads to the formation of
many cool filaments and blobs, and to a thin and rather light accretion disc of
about an arcsecond scale. The disc however does not extend all the way to our
inner boundary. Instead, hot X-ray emitting gas dominates the inner arcsecond.
In our simulations, cool streams of gas frequently enter this region on low
angular momentum orbits, and are then disrupted and heated up to the ambient
hot gas temperature. The accreting gas around Sgr A* is thus two-phase, with a
hot component, observable at X-ray wavelengths, and a cool component, which may
be responsible for the majority of time variability of Sgr A* emission on
hundred and thousand years time-scales. We obtain an accretion rate of a few
times 10^-6 msun/year, consistent with Chandra estimates, but variable on
time-scales even shorter than hundred years. These results strongly depend on
the chosen stellar orbits and wind parameters. Further observational input is
thus key to a better modelling of Sgr A* wind accretion.",2005-02-02T17:20:57Z
"High-Resolution Molecular Line Observations of the Environment of the
  Class 0 Source B1-IRS","In this work we present VLA observations of the NH3, CCS, and H2O maser
emission at 1 cm from the star forming region B1-IRS (IRAS 03301+3057) with ~
5"" (=1750 AU) of angular resolution. CCS emission is distributed in three
clumps around the central source. These clumps exhibit a velocity gradient from
red- to blueshifted velocities toward B1-IRS, probably due to an interaction
with the outflow from an embedded protostar. The outflow and its powering
source are traced by a reflection nebula and an associated infrared point
source detected in a 2MASS K-band image. We find that this infrared point
source is associated with water maser emission distributed in an elongated
structure (~ 450 AU size) along the major axis of the reflection nebula and
tracing the base of the outflow of the region. Ammonia emission is extended and
spatially anticorrelated with CCS. This is the first time that this kind of
anticorrelation is observed in a star forming region with such a high angular
resolution, and illustrates the importance of time-dependent chemistry on small
spatial scales. The relatively large abundance of CCS with respect to ammonia,
compared with other star forming regions, suggests an extreme youth for the
B1-IRS object (<10E+5 yr). We suggest the possibility that CCS abundance is
enhanced via shock-induced chemistry.",2005-04-07T10:11:44Z
The chemistry of high-mass star formation,"This paper reviews the chemistry of star-forming regions, with an emphasis on
the formation of high-mass stars. We first outline the basic molecular
processes in dense clouds, their implementation in chemical models, and
techniques to measure molecular abundances. Then, recent observational,
theoretical and laboratory developments are reviewed on the subjects of hot
molecular cores, cosmic-ray ionization, depletion and deuteration, and oxygen
chemistry. The paper concludes with a summary of outstanding problems and
future opportunities.",2005-06-07T15:23:59Z
"Large-Amplitude, Pair-Creating Oscillations in Pulsar and Black Hole
  Magnetospheres","A time-dependent model for pair creation in a pulsar magnetosphere is
developed. It is argued that the parallel electric field that develops in a
charge-starved region (a gap) of a pulsar magnetosphere oscillates with large
amplitude. Electrons and positrons are accelerated periodically and the
amplitude of the oscillations is assumed large enough to cause creation of
upgoing and downgoing pairs at different phases of the oscillation. With a
charge-starved initial condition, we find that the oscillations result in
bursts of pair creation in which the pair density rises exponentially with
time. The pair density saturates at $N_\pm\simeq E_{0}^2/(8\pi
m_ec^2\Gamma_{\rm thr})$, where $E_0$ is the parallel electric field in the
charge-starved initial state, and $\Gamma_{\rm thr}$ is the Lorentz factor for
effec tive pair creation. The frequency of oscillations following the pair
creation burst is given roughly by $\omega_{\rm osc}=eE_0/(8m_ec\Gamma_{\rm
thr})$. A positive feedback keeps the system stable, such that the average pair
creation rate balances the loss rate due to pairs escaping the magnetosphere.",2005-03-14T09:04:03Z
"XMM-Newton Spectroscopy of the Starburst Dominated Ultra Luminous
  Infrared Galaxy NGC 6240","We present new XMM-Newton observation of the Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxy
(ULIRG) NGC 6240. We analyze the reflecting grating spectrometer (RGS) data,
and data from the other instruments, and find a starburst dominated 0.5-3 keV
spectrum with global properties resembling those observed in M82 but with a
much higher luminosity. We show that the starburst region can be divided into
an outer zone, beyond a radius of about 2.1 kpc, with a gas temperature of
about 10^7 K and a central region with temperatures in the range (2-6) x 10^7
K. The gas in the outer region emits most of the observed Oviii Lyman-alpha
line and the gas in the inner region the emission lines of higher ionization
ions, including a strong Fexxv line. We also identify a small inner part, very
close to the active nuclei, with typical Seyfert 2 properties including a large
amount of photoionized gas producing a strong Fe K-alpha 6.4 keV line. The
combined abundance, temperature and emission measure analysis indicates super
solar Ne/O, Mg/O, Si/O, S/O and possibly also Fe/O. The analysis suggests
densities in the range of (0.07-0.28) x epsilon^(-1/2) cm^(-3) and a total
thermal gas mass of about 4 x 10^8 x epsilon^(1/2) solar masses, where epsilon
is the volume filling factor. We used a simple model to argue that a massive
starburst with an age of about 2 x 10^7 years can explain most of the observed
properties of the source. NGC 6240 is perhaps the clearest case of an X-ray
bright luminous AGN, in a merger, whose soft X-ray spectrum is dominated by a
powerful starburst.",2005-05-02T10:04:18Z

  Wavelengths and Absolute Calibration","The isophotal wavelengths, flux densities, and AB magnitudes for Vega (alpha
Lyr) are presented for the Mauna Kea Observatories near-infrared filter set. We
show that the near-infrared absolute calibration for Vega determined by Cohen
et al. and Megessier are consistent within the uncertainties, so that either
absolute calibration may be used.",2005-02-05T05:04:09Z
The heavy elements mixture and the stellar cluster age,"Recent analyses of solar spectroscopic data (see Asplund, Grevesse & Sauval
2004 and references therein) suggest a significative variation of the heavy
elements abundance. The change of heavy mixture might affect the determination
of the clusters age for two different reasons: the change of theoretical
isochrones at fixed metallicity and the variation of the inferred cluster
metallicity from the observed [Fe/H]. The first point is analyzed discussing
the effects of updating the metal distribution on theoretical evolutionary
tracks and isochrones for metallicities suitable for the galactic globular and
open clusters and for the bulk population of the Large Magellanic Clouds. The
maximum variation of the estimated age ($\approx$0.5 Gyr), although not
negligible, is still within the present uncertainty. The second point is
addressed by comparing present theoretical predictions with the very precise
observational data of the Hyades cluster from the Hypparcos satellite.",2005-04-27T18:40:15Z
IRAC Observations of Taurus Pre-Main Sequence Stars,"We present infrared photometry obtained with the IRAC camera on the Spitzer
Space Telescope of a sample of 82 pre-main sequence stars and brown dwarfs in
the Taurus star-forming region. We find a clear separation in some IRAC
color-color diagrams between objects with and without disks. A few
``transition'' objects are noted, which correspond to systems in which the
inner disk has been evacuated of small dust. Separating pure disk systems from
objects with remnant protostellar envelopes is more difficult at IRAC
wavelengths, especially for objects with infall at low rates and large angular
momenta. Our results generally confirm the IRAC color classification scheme
used in previous papers by Allen et al. and Megeath et al. to distinguish
between protostars, T Tauri stars with disks, and young stars without (inner)
disks. The observed IRAC colors are in good agreement with recent improved disk
models, and in general accord with models for protostellar envelopes derived
from analyzing a larger wavelength region. We also comment on a few Taurus
objects of special interest. Our results should be useful for interpreting IRAC
results in other, less well-studied star-forming regions.",2005-05-16T15:57:52Z
Supernova search at intermediate z. I. Spectroscopic analysis,"We study 8 supernovae discovered as part of the International Time Programme

project is to increase the sample of intermediate redshift (0.1<z<0.4) SNe Ia
for testing properties of SNe Ia along z and for enlarging the sample in the
Hubble diagram up to large z.",2005-02-20T23:02:27Z
Comparisons of an Evolutionary Chemical Model with Other Models,"We compare an evolutionary chemical model with simple empirical models of the
abundance and with static chemical models. We focus on the prediction of
molecular line profiles that are commonly observed in low mass star forming
cores. We show that empirical models can be used to constrain evaporation radii
and infall radii using lines of some species. Species with more complex
abundance profiles are not well represented by the empirical models. Static
chemical models produce abundance profiles different from those obtained from
an evolutionary calculation because static models do not account for the flow
of matter inward from the outer regions. The resulting profiles of lines used
to probe infall may differ substantially.",2005-06-03T18:33:33Z
"Hybrid Characteristics: 3D radiative transfer for parallel adaptive mesh
  refinement hydrodynamics","We have developed a three-dimensional radiative transfer method designed
specifically for use with parallel adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics
codes. This new algorithm, which we call hybrid characteristics, introduces a
novel form of ray tracing that can neither be classified as long, nor as short
characteristics, but which applies the underlying principles, i.e. efficient
execution through interpolation and parallelizability, of both. Primary
applications of the hybrid characteristics method are radiation hydrodynamics
problems that take into account the effects of photoionization and heating due
to point sources of radiation. The method is implemented in the hydrodynamics
package FLASH. The ionization, heating, and cooling processes are modelled
using the DORIC ionization package. Upon comparison with the long
characteristics method, we find that our method calculates the column density
with a similarly high accuracy and produces sharp and well defined shadows. We
show the quality of the new algorithm in an application to the photoevaporation
of multiple over-dense clumps. We present several test problems demonstrating
the feasibility of our method for performing high resolution three-dimensional
radiation hydrodynamics calculations that span a large range of scales. Initial
performance tests show that the ray tracing part of our method takes less time
to execute than other parts of the calculation (e.g. hydrodynamics and adaptive
mesh refinement), and that a high degree of efficiency is obtained in parallel
execution. Although the hybrid characteristics method is developed for problems
involving photoionization due to point sources, the algorithm can be easily
adapted to the case of more general radiation fields.",2005-05-10T23:26:25Z
Optical and Infrared Signatures of ULX's,"We have constructed a model to describe the optical emission from
ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). We assume a binary model with a black hole
accreting matter from a Roche lobe filling companion star. We consider the
effects of radiative transport and radiative equilibrium in the irradiated
surfaces of both the star and a thin accretion disk. We have developed this
model as a tool with which to positively identify the optical counterparts of
ULXs, and subsequently derive parameters such as the black hole mass and the
luminosity class and spectral type of the counterpart. We examine the
dependence of the optical emission on these and other variables. We extend our
model to examine the magnitude variation at infrared wavelengths, and we find
that observations at these wavelengths may have more diagnostic power than in
the optical. We apply our model to existing HST observations of the candidates
for the optical counterpart of ULX X-7 in NGC 4559. All candidates could be
consistent with an irradiated star alone, but we find that a number of them are
too faint to fit with an irradiated star and disk together. Were one of these
the optical counterpart to X-7, it would display a significant temporal
variation.",2005-06-03T16:58:40Z
"Spatially Resolved Spectroscopy of the E+A Galaxies in the z=0.32
  Cluster AC114","We present spatially resolved intermediate resolution spectroscopy of a
sample of twelve E+A galaxies in the z=0.32 rich galaxy cluster AC 114,
obtained with the FLAMES multi-integral field unit system on the European
Southern Observatory's VLT. Previous integrated spectroscopy of all these
galaxies by Couch & Sharples (1987) had shown them to have strong Balmer line
absorption and an absence of [OII 3727] emission -- the defining
characteristics of the``E+A'' spectral signature, indicative of an abrupt halt
to a recent episode of quite vigorous star formation. We have used our spectral
data to determine the radial variation in the strength of Hdelta absorption in
these galaxies and hence map out the distribution of this recently formed
stellar population. Such information provides important clues as to what
physical event might have been responsible for this quite dramatic change in
star formation activity in these galaxies' recent past. We find a diversity of
behaviour amongst these galaxies in terms of the radial variation in Hdelta
absorption: Four galaxies show little Hdelta absorption across their entire
extent; it would appear they were misidentified as E+A galaxies in the earlier
integrated spectroscopic studies. The remainder show strong Hdelta absorption,
with a gradient that is either negative (Hdelta equivalent width decreasing
with radius), flat, or positive. By comparing with numerical simulations we
suggest that the first of these different types of radial behaviour provides
evidence for a merger/interaction origin, whereas the latter two types of
behaviour are more consistent with the truncation of star formation in normal
disk galaxies. It would seem therefore that more than one physical mechanism is
responsible for E+A formation in the same environment.",2005-03-03T03:05:11Z
The Formation Histories of Galaxy Clusters,"A sample of hundreds of simulated galaxy clusters is used to study the
statistical properties of galaxy cluster formation. Individual assembly
histories are discussed, the degree of virialization is demonstrated and
various commonly used formation times are measured and inter-compared. In
addition, the fraction of clusters which have ``recently'' undergone a major
merger or significant mass jump is calculated as a function of lookback time
and interval. The fraction of three- and four-body mergers is also studied.",2005-06-09T18:59:29Z
Lensed CMB power spectra from all-sky correlation functions,"Weak lensing of the CMB changes the unlensed temperature anisotropy and
polarization power spectra. Accounting for the lensing effect will be crucial
to obtain accurate parameter constraints from sensitive CMB observations.
Methods for computing the lensed power spectra using a low-order perturbative
expansion are not good enough for percent-level accuracy. Non-perturbative
flat-sky methods are more accurate, but curvature effects change the spectra at
the 0.3-1% level. We describe a new, accurate and fast, full-sky
correlation-function method for computing the lensing effect on CMB power
spectra to better than 0.1% at l<2500 (within the approximation that the
lensing potential is linear and Gaussian). We also discuss the effect of
non-linear evolution of the gravitational potential on the lensed power
spectra. Our fast numerical code is publicly available.",2005-02-21T17:37:52Z
Stability of strange stars (SS) under radial oscillation,"A realistic Equation of State (EOS) leads to strange stars (ReSS) which are
compact in the mass radius plot, close to the Schwarzchild limiting line (Dey
et al. 1998). We carry out a stability analysis under radial oscillations and
compare with the EOS of other SS models. We find that the ReSS is stable and an
M-R region can be identified to that effect.",2005-03-17T03:38:04Z
First Results from the CHARA Array. II. A Description of the Instrument,"The CHARA Array is a six 1-m telescope optical/IR interferometric array
located on Mount Wilson California, designed and built by the Center for High
Angular Resolution Astronomy of Georgia State University. In this paper we
describe the main elements of the Array hardware and software control systems
as well as the data reduction methods currently being used. Our plans for
upgrades in the near future are also described.",2005-04-04T21:01:36Z
Strange star equations of state revisited,"Motivated by recent suggestions that strange stars can be responsible for
glitches and other observational features of pulsar, we review some possible
equations of state and their implications for models of neutron, hybrid and
strange stars. We consider the MIT bag model and also strange matter in the
color-flavored-locked phase. The central energy densities for strange stars are
higher than the central densities of ordinary neutron stars. Strange stars are
bound by the strong force and so can also rotate much faster than neutron
stars. These results are only weakly dependent on the model used for the quark
matter. If just one of the existing mass to radius ratio constraint is valid,
most neutron stars equations of state are ruled out, but all the strange stars
equations of state presented in this work remain consistent with the
constraint.",2005-06-08T01:09:55Z
The luminosity dependence of the Type 1 AGN fraction,"Using a complete, magnitude-limited sample of active galaxies from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) we show that the fraction of broad-line (Type 1)
active galactic nuclei increases with luminosity of the isotropically-emitted
[O III] narrow emission line. Our results are quantitatively in agreement with,
and far less uncertain than, similar trends found from studies of X-ray and
radio-selected active galaxies. While the correlation between broad-line
fraction and luminosity is qualitatively consistent with the receding torus
model, its slope is shallower and we therefore propose a modification to this
model where the height of the torus increases slowly with AGN luminosity. We
demonstrate that the faint-end slope of the AGN luminosity function steepens
significantly when a correction for `missing' Type 2 objects is made and that
this can substantially affect the overall AGN luminosity density extrapolated
from samples of more luminous objects.",2005-03-23T15:38:44Z
Spatially resolved PAH emission in the inner disks of Herbig Ae/Be stars,"We present adaptive optics high angular resolution ($\sim0.1\arcsec$)
spectroscopic observations in the 3 \um region of eight well known Herbig Ae/Be
stars with circumstellar disks. We detect the aromatic emission feature at 3.3
\um for four out of six of our objects with flared disks (HD 169142, HD 97048,
HD 100453, HD 100546), some weaker additional features at 3.4 and 3.46 $\mu$m
and nanodiamond features at 3.43 and 3.53 \um in two of our flared object (HD
100546 and HD 97048 respectively). We also detect hydrogen recombination line
at 3.74 \um in practically all objects. The emission in the polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) feature at 3.3 \um, additional and nanodiamond features in
the 3.4-3.5 \um region is, for the first time, spatially resolved in all the
sources where the features are detected. The full-width at half-maximum sizes
that we derive are typical of emission arising in a circumstellar disk. On the
other hand, the continuum emission is unresolved, with the exception of HD
97048 where it is marginally resolved. We compare the observed spatial
distribution of the 3.3 $\mu$m PAH feature and the adjacent continuum to the
predictions of a disk model that includes transiently heated small grains and
PAHs in addition to large grains in thermal equilibrium \cite[]{habart2004a}.
The model predicts that, as observed, the 3.3 $\mu$m PAH emission feature is
significantly broader than that of the adjacent continuum and that about 50% of
its integrated intensity comes from a radius $R<$ 30 AU. We find that the
predicted brightness profiles reproduce very well the observed ones. This
proves beyond doubt that the energetic 3.3 $\mu$m PAH emission feature takes
its origin in the inner disk regions.",2005-03-04T18:36:05Z
Plasma Diffuser Sorts Light Atoms to Solar Surface,"The Sun operates like a giant plasma diffuser that sorts lighter isotopes and
elements to the solar surface. Measurements indicate that the interior of the
Sun consists mostly of the same seven, even-numbered elements as ordinary
meteorites: Iron, oxygen, nickel, silicon, sulfur, magnesium, and calcium.
These ordinary elements compose clothing on the central neutron star that was
produced at the core of the supernova that exploded here 5 billion years ago.
Neutron emission generates most solar energy. Neutron-decay near the core
produces Hydrogen ions that are accelerated upward by deep-seated magnetic
fields. This is the carrier gas that maintains mass separation in the Sun. Like
smoke, Hydrogen is a by-product from the solar furnace that powers the Sun. As
smoke passes over catalytic converters in the flue of a high-efficiency
furnace, most Hydrogen is fused into Helium during its upward journey. H-fusion
makes less than 38 percent of solar energy. Each year 50 trillion tons of
Hydrogen reach the solar surface and are flung off in the solar wind, with
isotopes of other trace elements carefully sorted by mass. Hydrogen is smoke
from the solar furnace, rather than its primary fuel.",2005-02-10T04:34:59Z
"Nonthermal hard X-ray excess in the cluster Abell 2256 from two epoch
  observations","After confirmation of the presence of a nonthermal hard X-ray excess with
respect to the thermal emission in the Coma cluster from two independent
observations, obtained using the Phoswich Detection System onboard BeppoSAX, we
present in this Letter also for Abell 2256 the results of two observations
performed with a time interval of about 2.5 yr. In both spectra a nonthermal
excess is present at a confidence level of ~3.3sigma and ~3.7sigma,
respectively. The combined spectrum obtained by adding up the two spectra
allows to measure an excess at the level of ~4.8sigma in the 20-80 keV energy
range. The nonthermal X-ray flux is in agreement with the published value of
the first observation (Fusco-Femiano et al. 2000) and with that measured by a
Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer observation (Rephaeli & Gruber 2003).",2005-04-06T12:14:20Z
Spin-up of the hyperon-softened accreting neutron stars,"We study the spin-up of the accreting neutron stars with a realistic
hyperon-softened equation of state. Using precise 2-D calculations we study the
evolutionary tracks of accreting neutron stars in the angular-momentum -
frequency plane. In contrast to the case of spinning-down solitary
radio-pulsars, where a strong back-bending behavior has been observed, we do
not see back-bending phenomenon in the accretion-powered spinning-up case. We
conclude that in the case of accretion-driven spin-up the back-bending is
strongly suppressed by the mass-increase effect accompanying the
angular-momentum increase.",2005-02-07T15:50:48Z
Soft gamma repeaters and starforming galaxies,"We propose that the best sites to search for SGRs outside the Local group are
galaxies with active star formation. Different possibilities to observe SGR
activity from these sites are discussed. In particular we searched for giant
flares from M82, M83, NGC 253, and NGC 4945 in the BATSE data. We present a
list of potential candidates, however, in our opinion no good candidates alike
giant SGR flares were found. Still, hyperflares similar to the one of 27
December 2004 can be observed from larger distances. From the BATSE data we
select 5 candidates coincident with the galaxies Arp 299 and NGC 3256 which
have very high rate of starformation, and propose that they can be examples of
hyperflares; but this result has low statistical significance.",2005-02-20T16:32:53Z
Chandra Observations of 12 Luminous Red Quasars,"We present results of a study of 12 dust-reddened quasars with 0.4 < z < 2.65
and reddenings in the range 0.15 < E(B-V) < 1.7. We obtained ACIS-S X-ray
spectra of these quasars, estimated the column densities towards them, and
hence obtained the gas:dust ratios in the material obscuring the quasar. We
detect all but one of the red quasars in the X-rays. Even though there is no
obvious correlation between the X-ray determined column densities of our
sources and their optical color or reddening, all of the sources show absorbed
X-ray spectra. When we correct the luminosity for absorption, they can be
placed among luminous quasars; therefore our objects belong to the group of
high luminosity analogues of the sources contributing to the X-ray background
seen in deep X-ray observations. Such sources are also found in serendipitous
shallow X-ray surveys. There is a hint that the mean spectral slope of the red
quasar is higher than that of normal, unobscured quasars, which could be an
indication for higher accretion rates and/or an evolutionary effect. We
investigate the number density of these sources compared to type 2 AGN based on
the X-ray background and estimate how many moderate luminosity red quasars may
be found in deep X-ray fields.",2005-03-10T19:04:47Z
Chemical abundances in 43 metal-poor stars,"We have derived abundances of O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Ni
and Ba for 43 metal-poor field stars in the solar neighbourhood with iron
abundances [Fe/H] ranging from -0.4 to -3.0. Total abundance errors are
estimated to about 0.1-0.2 dex for most elements, while relative abundances are
most probably more accurate. We have made an extensive comparison with other
similar studies and traced the reasons for the, in most cases, relatively small
differences.
  Among the results we note the following: We find [O/Fe] from the O I IR-
triplet lines to possibly increase beyond [Fe/H]=-1.0, though considerably less
than obtained by others from abundances based on OH lines. We find correlations
among the deviations for individual stars from the trends of individual alpha
elements relative to Fe. This may support the idea that the formation of the
Halo stars occurred in smaller systems with different star formation rates. We
verify the finding by Gratton et al. (2003b) that stars that do not participate
in the rotation of the galactic disk show a lower mean and larger spread in
[alpha/Fe] than stars participating in the general rotation. The latter stars
also seem to show some correlation between [alpha/Fe] and rotation speed. We
finally advocate that a spectroscopic study of a larger sample of halo stars
with well-defined selection criteria is very important, in addition to the very
considerable efforts that various groups have already made. (Abridged)",2005-05-06T10:46:35Z
PNe in the dwarf galaxy NGC 6822: Detection of new candidates,"We have discovered 13 new candidate Planetary Nebulae (PNe) in the dwarf

"Late Arriving Particles in Cosmic Ray Air Showers and AGASA's
  Determination of UHECR Energies","We give the first detailed study of the arrival time distribution of nucleons
in UHECR air showers. We analyze in detail the influence of late arriving
particles on the energy determination of the AGASA experiment, as well as how
the arrival time distribution changes with distance from shower core. Our
calculations are consistent with experimental observations of the AGASA group.
Crucial to obtaining agreement, is the correct implementation of the energy
loss for low-energy protons. We confirm AGASA's estimation of the error in
their energy determination associated with late-arriving particles, assuming
primary protons.",2005-06-08T15:45:45Z
Magellanic Stream: A Possible Tool for Studying Dark Halo Model,"We model the dynamics of Magellanic Stream with the ram-pressure scenario in
the logarithmic and power-law galactic halo models and construct numerically
the past orbital history of Magellanic clouds and Magellanic Stream. The
parameters of models include the asymptotic rotation velocity of spiral arms,
halo flattening, core radius and rising or falling parameter of rotation curve.
We obtain the best fit parameters of galactic models through the maximum
likelihood analysis, comparing the high resolution radial velocity data of HI
in Magellanic Stream with that of theoretical models. The initial condition of
the Magellanic Clouds is taken from the six different values reported in the
literature. We find that oblate and nearly spherical shape halos provide a
better fit to the observation than the prolate halos. This conclusion is almost
independent of choosing the initial conditions and is valid for both
logarithmic and power-law models.",2005-04-07T07:27:09Z
Seismic constraints on open clusters,"We derive knowledge on the global and structural parameters of low-mass stars
using asteroseismology and taking advantage of the stellar collective behavior
within open clusters. We build stellar models and compute the seismic signal
expected from main sequence objects in the 0.8-1.6 Msun range. We first
evaluate apparent magnitudes and oscillations-induced luminosity fluctuations
expected in the Hyades, the Pleiades and the alpha Persei clusters. The closest
cluster presents a feasible challenge to observational asteroseismology in the
present and near future. We combine seismological and classical computations to
address three questions: what can be inferred about 1) mass, 2) composition and
3) extension of outer convection zones of solar analogs in the Hyades. The
first issue relies on the strong sensitivity of the large separation to mass.
Then large separations and second differences are used to respectively
constrain metal and helium fractions in the Hyades.When plotted for several
masses, the relation of effective temperature vs large separation is found to
be strongly dependent on the metal content. Besides this the second difference
main modulation is related to the second ionization of helium.The second
difference modulations are also partly due to the discontinuity in stellar
stratification at the convective envelope / radiative core transition. They
permit direct insight in the stellar structure. We compute acoustic radii of
the convective bases for different values of the mixing length theoryparameter
alpha_MLT in convection modelling, i.e. different convective efficiency in the
superadiabatic layers. For a given effectivetemperature we show that the
acoustic radius changes with convection efficiency.",2005-03-07T19:22:03Z
HCN and HCO+ Observations of the Galactic Circumnuclear Disk,"We present high spatial resolution (5.1"" x 2.7"") OVRO millimeter array
observations of HCN (J=1-0) and HCO+ (J=1-0) emission in the inner 3 pc of the
galaxy. The HCN and HCO+ emission of the circumnuclear disk (CND) is
distributed in a well-defined ring with a peak at a radius of 1.6pc. The
HCO+/HCN emission ratio is typically ~0.4 but with significant variations. The
HCN emission is well correlated with the H_2 emission at 2.12 microns both in
the main emission lobes of the CND and also in four filaments. Multiple areas
of interaction between the ionized gas and the CND are also seen - the western
arm of the minispiral is spatially and kinematically consistent with being the
ionized inner edge of the CND, and the northern arm may be connected to the CND
northeastern extension. With the enhanced spatial resolution of the HCN map, we
resolve numerous dense molecular gas cores within the CND with characteristic
diameter of 7"" (0.25pc). For 26 of the more isolated cores, we measure sizes,
velocity widths, and integrated fluxes. We estimate three masses for each core:
a virial mass, an optically thick mass, and a lower limit mass assuming
optically thin HCN emission. The virial and optically thick masses are in good
agreement with a typical mass of (2-3)x10^4 M_sun and a total CND gas mass of
10^6 M_sun. The internal densities implied by these core masses are on average
(3-4)x10^7 cm^-3, high enough to be stable against tidal disruption from Sgr A*
and the central stellar concentration. This tidal stability suggests a longer
lifetime for the CND. The higher densities and masses within the cores might
support star formation either in the CND itself or within a core infalling
toward the inner parsec, thus providing a mechanism for the formation of the
young stellar population in the inner arcseconds of the galaxy.",2005-02-25T19:41:57Z
"A Possible Correlation Between the Luminosities and Lifetimes of Active
  Galactic Nuclei","We use the clustering of galaxies around distant AGN to show with ~90%
confidence that fainter AGN are longer lived. Our argument is simple: since the
measured galaxy-AGN cross-correlation length r_0 ~ 5h^-1 Mpc does not vary
significantly over a 10 magnitude range in AGN optical luminosity, faint and
bright AGN must reside in dark matter halos with similar masses. The halos that
host bright and faint AGN therefore have similar intrinsic abundances, and the
large observed variation in AGN number density with luminosity reflects a
change in duty cycle.",2005-05-10T21:37:19Z
"Are rotation curves in NGC 6946 and the Milky Way magnetically
  supported?","Following the model of magnetically supported rotation of spiral galaxies,
the inner disk rotation is dominated by gravity but magnetism is not negligible
at radii where the rotation curve becomes flat, and indeed becomes dominant at
very large radii. Values of the order of 1 $\mu$G, or even less, produce a
centripetal force when the absolute value of the slope of the curve [$B_\phi$,
R] (azimuthal field strength versus radius) is less than $R^{-1}$. The
$R^{-1}$-profile is called the critical profile. From this hypothesis, the
following is to be expected: at large radii, a ``subcritical'' profile (slope
flatter than $R^{-1}$); at still larger radii a $B_\phi$-profile becoming
asymptotically critical as the density becomes asymptotically vanishing. Recent
observations of magnetic fields in NGC 6946 and the Milky Way are in very good
agreement with these predictions. This magnetic alternative requires neither
galactic dark matter (DM) nor modification of fundamental laws of physics, but
it is not in conflict with these hypotheses, especially with the existence of
cosmological cold dark matter (CDM).",2005-03-30T13:45:17Z
Too Early? On the Apparent Conflict of Astrobiology and Cosmology,"An interesting consequence of the modern cosmological paradigm is the spatial
infinity of the universe. When coupled with naturalistic understanding of the
origin of life and intelligence, which follows the basic tenets of
astrobiology, and with some fairly incontroversial assumptions in the theory of
observation selection effects, this infinity leads, as Ken Olum has recently
shown, to a paradoxical conclusion. Olum's paradox is related, to the famous
Fermi's paradox in astrobiology and SETI studies. We, hereby, present an
evolutionary argument countering the apparent inconsistency, and show how, in
the framework of a simplified model, deeper picture of the coupling between
histories of intelligent/technological civilizations and astrophysical
evolution of the Galaxy, can be achieved. This strategy has consequences of
importance for both astrobiological studies and philosophy.",2005-04-30T14:33:18Z
Star Formation in HI Selected Galaxies. II. HII Region Properties,"A sample of 69 galaxies with radial velocities less than 2500 km/s was
selected from the HI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS) to deduce details about
star formation in nearby disk galaxies selected with no bias to optical surface
brightness selection effects. Broad (B and R) and narrow band (H-alpha) images
were obtained for all of these objects. More than half of the sample galaxies
are late-type, dwarf disks (mostly Sc and Sm galaxies). We have measured the
properties of the HII regions on H-alpha, continuum subtracted images, using
the HIIphot package developed by Thilker et al. 2000. All but one of the
galaxies contained at least one detectable HII region. Examination of the
properties of the HII regions in each galaxy revealed that the brightest
regions in higher surface brightness galaxies tend to be more luminous than
those in lower surface brightness galaxies. A higher fraction (referred to as
the diffuse fraction) of the H-alpha emission from lower surface brightness
galaxies comes from diffuse ionized gas (DIG). HII region luminosity functions
(LFs) co-added according to surface brightness show that the shapes of the LFs
for the lowest surface brightness galaxies are different from those for typical
spiral galaxies. This discrepancy could be caused by the lowest surface
brightness galaxies having somewhat episodic star formation or by them forming
a relatively larger fraction of their stars outside of dense, massive molecular
clouds. In general, the results imply that the conditions under which star
formation occurs in lower surface brightness galaxies are different than in
more typical, higher surface brightness spiral galaxies.",2005-06-01T23:56:34Z
The phase-space distribution of infalling dark matter subhalos,"We use high-resolution numerical simulations to study the physical properties
of subhalos when they merge into their host halos. An improved algorithm is
used to identify the subhalos. We then examine their spatial and velocity
distributions in spherical and triaxial halo models. We find that the accretion
of satellites preferentially occurs along the major axis and perpendicular to
the spin axis of the host halo. Furthermore, the massive subhalos show a
stronger preference to be accreted along the major axis of the host halo than
the low-mass ones. Approximate fitting formulae are provided for the physical
properties of subhalos. Combined with analytical and semi-analytic techniques,
these empirical formulae provide a useful basis for studying the subsequent
evolution of subhalos and satellite galaxies in their hosts. Future studies
should however account for satellites that may not be undergoing the first
infall in their evolution.",2005-05-08T02:19:38Z
Near infrared and the inner regions of protoplanetary disks,"We examine the ``puffed-up inner disk'' model (Dullemond, Dominik & Natta
2001), proposed for explaining the near-IR excess radiation from Herbig Ae/Be
stars. Detailed model computations show that the observed near-IR excess
requires more hot dust than is contained in the puffed-up disk rim. The rim can
produce the observed near-IR excess only if its dust has perfectly gray
opacity, but such dust is in conflict with the observed 10$\mu$m spectral
feature. We find that a compact ($\sim$ 10 AU) tenuous ($\tau_V \la 0.4$) dusty
halo around the disk inner regions contains enough dust to readily explain the
observations. Furthermore, this model also resolves the puzzling relationship
noted by Monnier and Millan-Gabet (2002) between luminosity and the
interferometric inner radii of disks.",2005-06-07T22:01:39Z
"Evidence for an Untruncated Accretion Disk in the Broad-Line Radio
  Galaxy 4C+74.26","We present evidence for a broad, ionized Fe K line in the XMM-Newton spectrum
of the broad-line radio galaxy (BLRG) 4C+74.26. This is the first indication
that the innermost regions of the accretion flow in BLRGs contain thin,
radiatively efficient disks. Analysis of the 35 ks XMM-Newton observation finds
a broad line with an inner radius close to the innermost stable circular orbit
for a maximally spinning black hole. The outer radius of the relativistic line
is also found to be within 10 gravitational radii. The Fe K line profile gives
an inclination angle of ~40 degrees, consistent with the radio limit. There are
two narrow components to the Fe K complex: one at 6.4 keV from neutral Fe, and
one at 6.2 keV. These may form the blue and red horns of a diskline from
farther out on the disk, but a longer observation is required to confirm this
hypothesis. We discuss the implications of this observation for models of jet
production, and suggest that BLRGs and radio-loud quasars will have larger than
average black hole masses, thus resulting in thicker accretion flows close to
the black hole.",2005-02-22T16:58:13Z
"Gamma-Ray Background from Neutralino Annihilation in the First
  Cosmological Objects","The paradigm of the neutralino dark matter predicts that the first
gravitationally bound objects are earth-mass sized microhaloes, which would
emit annihilation gamma-rays. Here we show that, though the flux from
individual nearest microhaloes is extremely difficult to detect, meaningful
constraints on their survival probability and internal density profile can be
set by requiring that the galactic and extragalactic gamma-ray background flux
from the microhaloes does not exceed the existing EGRET background data.
Possible disruption of microhaloes by stellar encounters does not significantly
reduce the background flux. If the probability for microhaloes to survive the
hierarchical clustering process of dark matter is as large as indicated by a
recent simulation, they could be a significant component of the observed
background flux in some photon energy range, even with the standard
annihilation cross section and conservative internal density profile of
microhaloes. The integrated gamma-ray flux from microhaloes in the halo of the
Andromeda galaxy may also be detectable by observations in the near future.",2005-04-05T05:46:41Z
Stream-field interactions in the magnetic accretor AO Piscium,"UV spectra of the magnetic accretor AO Psc show absorption features for half
the binary orbit. The absorption is unlike the wind-formed features often seen
in similar stars. Instead, we attribute it to a fraction of the stream that
overflows the impact with the accretion disk. Rapid velocity variations can be
explained by changes in the trajectory of the stream depending on the
orientation of the white-dwarf's magnetic field. Hence we are directly
observing the interaction of an accretion stream with a rotating field. We
compare this behavior to that seen in other intermediate polars and in SW Sex
stars.",2005-03-09T10:08:13Z
Nuclear Astrophysics,"Nuclear physics has a long and productive history of application to
astrophysics which continues today. Advances in the accuracy and breadth of
astrophysical data and theory drive the need for better experimental and
theoretical understanding of the underlying nuclear physics. This paper will
review some of the scenarios where nuclear physics plays an important role,
including Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, neutrino production by our sun,
nucleosynthesis in novae, the creation of elements heavier than iron, and
neutron stars. Big-bang nucleosynthesis is concerned with the formation of
elements with A <= 7 in the early Universe; the primary nuclear physics inputs
required are few-nucleon reaction cross sections. The nucleosynthesis of
heavier elements involves a variety of proton-, alpha-, neutron-, and
photon-induced reactions, coupled with radioactive decay. The advent of
radioactive ion beam facilities has opened an important new avenue for studying
these processes, as many involve radioactive species. Nuclear physics also
plays an important role in neutron stars: both the nuclear equation of state
and cooling processes involving neutrino emission play a very important role.
Recent developments and also the interplay between nuclear physics and
astrophysics will be highlighted.",2005-02-28T19:50:58Z
"Discovery of 1323 s pulsations from RX J0103.6-7201: the longest period
  X-ray pulsar in the SMC","XMM-Newton archival observations of the Be/X-ray binary candidate RX
J0103.6-7201 revealed pulsations with a period of ~1323 s. This makes RX
J0103.6-7201 the X-ray pulsar with the longest period known in the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC). More than 150 X-ray observations of RX J0103.6-7201 by
ROSAT, Chandra and XMM-Newton show flux variations by a factor of 50 on time
scales of days to years. Using the accurate positions obtained from ACIS-I
images the optical counterpart is identified with a V = 14.6 mag emission line
star. EPIC spectra of RX J0103.6-7201 above 1 keV are consistent with an
absorbed power-law with column density between (6-9)x10^21 cm^-2, except during
one observation when an extraordinary high value of 1.1x10^23 cm^-2 was
measured which strongly attenuated the power-law emission below 3 keV. A soft
excess between 0.5 and 1.0 keV is evident in the spectra which becomes best
visible in the highly absorbed spectrum. The soft component can be reproduced
by a thermal plasma emission model with its luminosity strongly correlated with
the total intrinsic source luminosity. Including results from three other SMC
Be/X-ray binaries extends the linear correlation over three orders of magnitude
in source intensity, strongly suggesting that the same mechanism is responsible
for the generation of the soft emission.",2005-03-29T09:17:06Z
"Low T/|W| dynamical instability in differentially rotating stars:
  Diagnosis with canonical angular momentum","We study the nature of non-axisymmetric dynamical instabilities in
differentially rotating stars with both linear eigenmode analysis and
hydrodynamic simulations in Newtonian gravity. We especially investigate the
following three types of instability; the one-armed spiral instability, the low
T/|W| bar instability, and the high T/|W| bar instability, where T is the
rotational kinetic energy and W is the gravitational potential energy. The
nature of the dynamical instabilities is clarified by using a canonical angular
momentum as a diagnostic. We find that the one-armed spiral and the low T/|W|
bar instabilities occur around the corotation radius, and they grow through the
inflow of canonical angular momentum around the corotation radius. The result
is a clear contrast to that of a classical dynamical bar instability in high
T/|W|. We also discuss the feature of gravitational waves generated from these
three types of instability.",2005-05-26T20:23:46Z
Simulating a faint gamma-ray burst population,"There have now been three supernova-associated gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at
redshift z < 0.17, namely 980425, 030329, and 031203, but the nearby and
under-luminous GRBs 980425 and 031203 are distinctly different from the
`classical' or standard GRBs. It has been suggested that they could be
classical GRBs observed away from their jet axes, or they might belong to a
population of under-energetic GRBs. Recent radio observations of the afterglow
of GRB 980425 suggest that different engines may be responsible for the
observed diversity of cosmic explosions. Given this assumption, a crude
constraint on a luminosity function for faint GRBs with a mean luminosity
similar to that of GRB 980425 and an upper limit on the rate density of
980425-type events, we simulate the redshift distribution of under-luminous
GRBs assuming BATSE and Swift sensitivities. A local rate density of about 0.6%
of the local supernova Type Ib/c rate yields simulated probabilities for
under-luminous events to occur at rates comparable to the BATSE GRB
low-redshift distribution. In this scenario the probability of BATSE/HETE
detecting at least one GRB at z<0.05 is 0.78 over 4.5 years, a result that is
comparable with observation. Swift has the potential to detect 1--5
under-luminous GRBs during one year of observation.",2005-04-22T05:43:49Z
On the Possibility of Combustion of Neutrons into Strange Quark Matter,"It is shown that a conversion of neurons into strange quark matter in neutron
stars is possible by means of a combustion process with a well-defined front.
Conditions for the realization of a specific combustion mode, whether
deflagration, detonation, or fast combustion, are discussed for several forms
of the equations of state of neutron and strange matters.",2005-02-17T11:36:38Z
"Theoretical Interpretation of the Measurements of the Secondary Eclipses
  of TrES-1 and HD209458b","We calculate the planet-star flux-density ratios as a function of wavelength
from 0.5 microns to 25 microns for the transiting extrasolar giant planets
TrES-1 and HD209458b and compare them with the recent Spitzer/IRAC-MIPS
secondary eclipse data in the 4.5, 8.0, and 24 micron bands. With only three
data points and generic calibration issues, detailed conclusions are difficult,
but inferences regarding atmospheric composition, temperature, and global
circulation can be made. Our models reproduce the observations reasonably well,
but not perfectly, and we speculate on the theoretical consequences of
variations around our baseline models. One preliminary conclusion is that we
may be seeing in the data indications that the day side of a close-in
extrasolar giant planet is brighter in the mid-infrared than its night side,
unlike Jupiter and Saturn. This correspondence will be further tested when the
data anticipated in other Spitzer bands are acquired, and we make predictions
for what those data may show.",2005-03-23T23:23:21Z
"New photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Seyfert galaxy Mrk
  315","We present new important results about the intermediate-type Seyfert galaxy
Mrk 315, recently observed through optical imaging and integral-field
spectroscopy. Broad-band images were used to study the morphology of the host
galaxy, narrow-band H-alpha images to trace the star forming regions, and
middle-band [O III] images to evidence the distribution of the highly ionised
gas. Some extended emission regions were isolated and their physical properties
studied by means of flux calibrated spectra. High resolution spectroscopy was
used to separate different kinematic components in the velocity fields of gas
and stars. Some peculiar features characterise this apparently undisturbed and
moderately isolated active galaxy. Such features, already investigated by other
authors, are re-analysed and discussed in the light of these new observations.
The most relevant results we obtained are: the multi-tiers structure of the
disc; the presence of a quasi-ring of regions with star formation much higher
than previous claims; a secondary nucleus confirmed by a stellar component
kinematically decoupled by the main galaxy; a new hypothesis about the
controversial nature of the long filament, initially described as hook-shaped,
and more likely made of two independent filaments caused by interaction events
between the main galaxy and two dwarf companions.",2005-03-22T11:04:21Z
"Anisotropic cosmological models with non-minimally coupled magnetic
  field","Motivated by the structure of one-loop vacuum polarization effects in curved
spacetime we discuss a non-minimal extension of the Einstein-Maxwell equations.
This formalism is applied to Bianchi I models with magnetic field. We obtain
several exact solutions of the non-minimal system including those which
describe an isotropization process. We show that there are inflationary
solutions in which the cosmological constant is determined by the non-minimal
coupling parameters. Furthermore, we find an isotropic de Sitter solution
characterized by a ""screening"" of the magnetic field as a consequence of the
non-minimal coupling.",2005-04-10T10:34:43Z
Acceleration of weakly collisional solar-type winds,"One of the basic properties of the solar wind, that is the high speed of the
fast wind, is still not satisfactorily explained. This is mainly due to the
theoretical difficulty of treating weakly collisional plasmas. The fluid
approach implies that the medium is collision dominated and that the particle
velocity distributions are close to Maxwellians. However the electron velocity
distributions observed in the solar wind depart significantly from Maxwellians.
Recent kinetic collisionless models (called exospheric) using velocity
distributions with a suprathermal tail have been able to reproduce the high
speeds of the fast solar wind. In this letter we present new developments of
these models by generalizing them over a large range of corona conditions. We
also present new results obtained by numerical simulations that include
collisions. Both approaches calculate the heat flux self-consistently without
any assumption on the energy transport. We show that both approaches - the
exospheric and the collisional one - yield a similar variation of the wind
speed with the basic parameters of the problem; both produce a fast wind speed
if the coronal electron distribution has a suprathermal tail. This suggests
that exospheric models contain the necessary ingredients for the powering of a
transonic stellar wind, including the fast solar one.",2005-05-16T16:13:09Z
"A radial velocity survey of low Galactic latitude structures: I.
  Kinematics of the Canis Major dwarf galaxy","As part of a radial velocity survey of low Galactic latitude structures that
we undertook with the 2dF spectrograph on the AAT, we present the radial
velocities of more than 1500 Red Giant Branch and Red Clump stars towards the
centre of the Canis Major dwarf galaxy. With a mean velocity of 72\pm7 km/s at
a Heliocentric distance of 5.5 kpc and 114\pm2 km/s at 8.5 kpc, these stars
present a peculiar distance -- radial velocity relation that is unlike that
expected from thin or thick disc stars. Moreover, they belong to a
kinematically cold population with an intrinsic dispersion that may be as low
as 11_{-1}^{+3} km/s. The radial velocity distribution is used to select Canis
Major stars in the UCAC2.0 proper motion catalogue and derive proper motions in
Galactic coordinates of (\mu_l,\mu_b)= (-3.6\pm0.8 mas/yr, 1.5\pm0.4 mas/yr)
for the dwarf galaxy, which after correcting for the reflex solar motion along
this line-of-sight gives (\mu_l',\mu_b')= (-6.8\pm0.8 mas/yr, 0.8\pm0.4
mas/yr)$, corresponding to a prograde orbit with a tangential velocity of
\sim235 km/s at the average distance of \sim7.2 kpc. All these kinematic
constraints can be reproduced in simulations of the accretion of a dwarf onto
the Galactic disc. Such a process could also be responsible for the Monoceros
Ring that has recently been shown to encompass the Galactic disc. However,
without constraints on the kinematics of the tidal arms emerging from the Canis
Major dwarf, it is not yet possible to definitively prove a link between the
two structures.",2005-03-31T16:08:14Z
X-ray Orbital Modulations in Intermediate Polars,"We present an analysis of 30 archival ASCA and RXTE X-ray observations of 16
intermediate polars to investigate the nature of their orbital modulation. We
show that X-ray orbital modulation is widespread amongst these systems, but not
ubiquitous as indicated by previous studies that included fewer objects. Only
seven of the sixteen systems show a clearly statistically significant
modulation depth whose amplitude decreases with increasing X-ray energy.
Interpreting this as due to photoelectric absorption in material at the edge of
an accretion disc would imply that such modulations are visible for all system
inclination angles in excess of 60 degrees. However, it is also apparent that
the presence of an X-ray orbital modulation can appear and disappear on a
timescale of ~years or months in an individual system. This may be evidence for
the presence of a precessing, tilted accretion disc, as inferred in some low
mass X-ray binaries.",2005-03-30T14:08:58Z
"On the accuracy of slow-roll inflation given current observational
  constraints","We investigate the accuracy of slow-roll inflation in light of current
observational constraints, which do not allow for a large deviation from scale
invariance. We investigate the applicability of the first and second order
slow-roll approximations for inflationary models, including those with large
running of the scalar spectral index. We compare the full numerical solutions
with those given by the first and second order slow-roll formulae. We find that
even first order slow-roll is generally accurate; the largest deviations arise
in models with large running where the error in the power spectrum can be at
the level of 1-2%. Most of this error comes from inaccuracy in the calculation
of the slope and not of the running or higher order terms. Second order
slow-roll does not improve the accuracy over first order. We also argue that in
the basis $\epsilon_0=1/H$, $\epsilon_{n+1}={d\ln|\epsilon_n|}/{dN}$,
introduced by Schwarz et al. (2001), slow-roll does not require all of the
parameters to be small. For example, even a divergent $\epsilon_3$ leads to
finite solutions which are accurately described by a slow-roll approximation.
Finally, we argue that power spectrum parametrization recently introduced by
Abazaijan, Kadota and Stewart does not work for models where spectral index
changes from red to blue, while the usual Taylor expansion remains a good
approximation.",2005-06-14T20:27:18Z
"Discovery of Optical Emission in the Hotspots of Three 3CR Quasars:
  High-Energy Particle Acceleration in Powerful Radio Hotspots","Archival Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 images were used to search for optical
emission associated with the radio jets of a number of luminous quasars. From
this search, we report new optical hotspot detections in the well-known blazar
3C~454.3 and the lobe-dominated quasars 3C~275.1 and 3C~336. We also find
optical emission in the vicinity of the hotspot in 3C~208, but believe this is
a chance alignment. Optical emission from the arcsecond-scale jet in 3C~454.3
is also detected. Multi-frequency archival radio data from the VLA and MERLIN
are analyzed, and the synchrotron spectra of these high-power hotspots are
presented. We estimate that their break frequencies are in the range of
$10^{10}-10^{11}$ Hz, with large uncertainties due to the wide gap in frequency
coverage between the radio and optical bands. We also calculate their
equipartition magnetic fields, and find that the anti-correlation between break
frequency and magnetic field found by Brunetti et al. for lower power hotspots
extends to these high power hotspots. This supports their model of hot-spots
based on shock acceleration and synchrotron losses.",2005-03-29T22:20:16Z
Growth of Linear Perturbations before the Era of the First Galaxies,"We calculate the evolution of linear density and temperature perturbations in
a universe with dark matter, baryons, and radiation, from cosmic recombination
until the epoch of the first galaxies. In addition to gravity, the
perturbations are effected by electron scattering with the radiation, by
radiation pressure, and by gas pressure. We include the effect of spatial
fluctuations in the baryonic sound speed and show that they induce a >10%
change in the baryonic density power spectrum on small scales, and a larger
change on all scales in the power spectrum of gas temperature fluctuations. A
precise calculation of the growth of linear perturbations is essential since
they provide the initial conditions for the formation of galaxies and they can
also be probed directly via cosmological 21cm fluctuations. We also show that
in general the thermal history of the cosmic gas can be measured from 21cm
fluctuations using a small-scale anisotropic cutoff due to the thermal width of
the 21cm line.",2005-03-08T21:15:12Z
The GALEX UV luminosity function of the cluster of galaxies Abell 1367,"We present the GALEX NUV (2310 A) and FUV (1530 A) galaxy luminosity
functions of the nearby cluster of galaxies A1367 in the magnitude range -20.3<
M_AB < -13.3. The luminosity functions are consistent with previous (~ 2 mag
shallower) estimates based on the FOCA and FAUST experiments, but display a
steeper faint-end slope than the GALEX luminosity function for local field
galaxies. Using spectro-photometric optical data we select out star-forming
systems from quiescent galaxies and study their separate contributions to the
cluster luminosity function. We find that the UV luminosity function of cluster
star-forming galaxies is consistent with the field. The difference between the
cluster and field LF is entirely due to the contribution at low luminosities
(M_AB >-16 mag) of non star-forming, early-type galaxies that are significantly
over dense in clusters.",2005-02-02T15:16:40Z
"X-ray States of Black-Hole Binaries and Implications for the Mechanism
  of Steady Jets","The three X-ray states of active accretion in black-hole binaries have been
re-defined to focus attention on different physical elements that may
contribute radiation: the accretion disk, a jet, and a compact and radio-quiet
corona. Examples of state evolution are displayed on a time line, and on a
hardness-intensity diagram. The latter format allows a synthesis of these
states with the ``unified model for black hole binary jets'' by Fender,
Belloni, & Gallo (2004). As suggested by Corbel (2004), the ``jet line''
appears to coincide with the hard limit of the SPL state. In GX339-4, the broad
power peaks in the PDS are confined to intermediate and hard states, where a
jet is present. This suggests that these Fourier components are temporal
signatures of non-thermal processes related to the jet mechanism, rather than
properties inherent to a standard accretion disk.",2005-04-05T22:45:31Z
Thermal Evolution of Supernova Iron in Elliptical Galaxies,"In explaining the relative metal abundances observed in galaxy groups and
clusters, it is generally assumed that all metals created by supernovae are
present either in visible stars or the hot gas. We discuss here the possibility
that some of the iron expelled into the hot gas by Type Ia supernovae may have
radiatively cooled, avoiding detection by X-ray and optical observers.
Hydrodynamic models of Type Ia explosions in the hot gas inside elliptical
galaxies result in a gas of nearly pure iron that is several times hotter than
the local interstellar gas. We describe the subsequent thermal evolution of the
iron-rich gas as it radiates and thermally mixes with the surrounding gas.
There is a critical time by which the iron ions must mix into the ambient gas
to avoid rapid radiative cooling. We find that successful mixing is possible if
the iron ions diffuse with large mean free paths, as in an unmagnetized plasma.
However, in microgauss fields the Larmor radii of the iron ions are
exceptionally small, so the field geometry must be highly tangled or radial to
allow the iron to mix by diffusion faster than it cools by radiative losses.
The possibility that some of the supernova iron cools cannot be easily
discounted.",2005-05-26T09:34:21Z
The 3-D Structure of the Helix Nebula,"The 3-D structure of the Helix Nebula has been addressed multiple times and
is slowly yielding to application of monochromatic emission line imaging, high
resolution spectroscopy, and photoionization theory. The inner structure of the
nebula is a toroidal disk filled with doubly ionized helium and is ionization
bounded, with an extended vertical component resembling the structure of
numerous bipolar nebulae. The outer structure is less well defined, with one
construction being that there is an open-center outer-disk that is nearly
perpendicular to the inner-disk and an alternate construction that explains the
features seen just outside the inner-disk as being the result of the observer's
line of sight passing through extended lobes perpendicular to the inner-disk. A
definitive model awaits thorough velocity mapping in the major diagnostic
emission lines. However, even our well-defined knowledge of the inner-disk
defies explanation by the simplest application of the broadly accepted two-wind
model for the formation of PN.",2005-05-26T15:46:14Z
Concurrent 43 and 86 GHz Very Long Baseline Polarimetry of 3C273,"We present sub-milliarcsecond resolution total intensity and linear
polarization VLBI images of 3C273, using concurrent 43 and 86 GHz data taken
with the Very Long Baseline Array in May 2002. The structure seen in the
innermost jet suggest that we have fortuitously caught the jet in the act of
changing direction. The polarization images confirm that the core is
unpolarized (fractional polarization m < 1 %) at 86 GHz, but also show well
ordered magnetic fields (m ~ 15 %) in the inner jet, at a projected distance of
2.3 pc from the core. In this strongly polarized region, the rotation measure
changes across the jet by 4.2 x 10^{4} rad m^{-2} over an angular width of
about 0.3 milliarcseconds. If the lack of polarization in the core is also
attributed to a Faraday screen, then a rotation measure dispersion > 5.2 x
10^{4} rad m^{-2} must be present in or in front of that region. These are
among the highest rotation measures reported so far in the nucleus of any
active galaxy or quasar, and must occur outside (but probably close to) the
radio emitting region. The transverse rotation measure gradient is in the same
sense as that observed by Asada et al and by Zavala and Taylor at greater core
distances. The magnitude of the transverse gradient decreases rapidly with
distance down the jet, and appears to be variable.",2005-06-10T18:24:08Z
The Globular Cluster System of NGC 1399 IV. Some noteworthy objects,"We present 8 bright globular clusters and/or objects of less familiar nature
which we found in the course of scrutinizing the globular cluster system of NGC
1399. These objects are morphologically striking, either by their sizes or by
other structural properties. Some of them may be candidates for stripped dwarf
galaxy nuclei, emphasizing the possible role of accretion in the NGC 1399
cluster system. They are all highly interesting targets for further deep
spectroscopy or HST-imaging. Since these objects have been found within an area
of only 42 arcmin**2, we expect many more still to be detected in a full census
of the NGC 1399 cluster system.",2005-05-16T18:28:13Z
Acceleration of Plasma Flows Due to Reverse Dynamo Mechanism,"The ""reverse-dynamo"" mechanism - the amplification/generation of fast plasma
flows by micro scale (turbulent) magnetic fields via magneto-fluid coupling is
recognized and explored. It is shown that macro-scale magnetic fields and flows
are generated simultaneously and proportionately from micro scale fields and
flows. The stronger the micro-scale driver, the stronger are the macro-scale
products. Stellar and astrophysical applications are suggested.",2005-03-20T13:56:33Z
Testing MOND with VirgoHI21,"The 'dark galaxy' VIRGOHI21 seems to be composed of an unusually high
proportion of darkmatter and is situated in a strong external gravitational
field. As such it offers a rare test for theories of modified dynamics. If the
system is bound then its dynamics are inconsistent with those predicted by
theMOND theory.",2005-03-04T18:18:46Z
Observational constraints on interacting quintessence models,"We determine the range of parameter space of Interacting Quintessence Models
that best fits the recent WMAP measurements of Cosmic Microwave Background
temperature anisotropies. We only consider cosmological models with zero
spatial curvature. We show that if the quintessence scalar field decays into
cold dark matter at a rate that brings the ratio of matter to dark energy
constant at late times,the cosmological parameters required to fit the CMB data
are: \Omega_x = 0.43 \pm 0.12, baryon fraction \Omega_b = 0.08 \pm 0.01, slope
of the matter power spectrum at large scals n_s = 0.98 \pm 0.02 and Hubble
constant H_0 = 56 \pm 4 km/s/Mpc. The data prefers a dark energy component with
a dimensionless decay parameter c^2 =0.005 and non-interacting models are
consistent with the data only at the 99% confidence level. Using the Bayesian
Information Criteria we show that this exra parameter fits the data better than
models with no interaction. The quintessence equation of state parameter is
less constrained; i.e., the data set an upper limit w_x \leq -0.86 at the same
level of significance. When the WMAP anisotropy data are combined with
supernovae data, the density parameter of dark energy increases to \Omega_x
\simeq 0.68 while c^2 augments to 6.3 \times 10^{-3}. Models with quintessence
decaying into dark matter provide a clean explanation for the coincidence
problem and are a viable cosmological model, compatible with observations of
the CMB, with testable predictions. Accurate measurements of baryon fraction
and/or of matter density independent of the CMB data, would support/disprove
these models.",2005-03-10T12:47:52Z
Non-Thermal Emission from AGN Coronae,"Accretion disk coronae are believed to account for X-ray emission in Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). In this paper the observed emission is assumed to be
due to a population of relativistic, non-thermal electrons (e.g. produced in a
flare) injected at the top of an accretion disk magnetic loop. While electrons
stream along magnetic field lines their energy distribution evolves in time
essentially because of inverse Compton and synchrotron losses. The
corresponding time dependent emission due, in the X-ray energy range, to the
inverse Compton mechanism, has been computed. Since the typical decay time of a
flare is shorter than the integration time for data acquisition in the X-ray
domain, the resulting spectrum is derived as the temporal mean of the real,
time-dependent, emission, as originated by a series of consecutive and
identical flares. The model outcome is compared to both the broad band BeppoSAX
X-ray data of the bright Seyfert 1 NGC 5548, and to a few general X-ray
spectral properties of Seyfert 1s as a class. The good agreement between model
and observations suggests that the presently proposed non-thermal,
non-stationary model could be a plausible explanation of AGN X-ray emission, as
an alternative to thermal coronae models.",2005-03-08T07:56:15Z
"Self-similar solutions for relativistic shocks emerging from stars with
  polytropic envelopes","We consider a strong ultrarelativistic shock moving through a star whose
envelope has a polytrope-like density profile. When the shock is close to the
star's outer boundary, its behavior follows the self-similar solution given by
Sari (2005) for implosions in planar geometry. Here we outline this solution
and find the asymptotic solution as the shock reaches the star's edge. We then
show that the motion after the shock breaks out of the star is described by a
self-similar solution remarkably like the solution for the motion inside the
star. In particular, the characteristic Lorentz factor, pressure, and density
vary with time according to the same power laws both before and after the shock
breaks out of the star. After emergence from the star, however, the
self-similar solution's characteristic position corresponds to a point behind
the leading edge of the flow rather than at the shock front, and the relevant
range of values for the similarity variable changes. Our numerical integrations
agree well with the analytic results both before and after the shock reaches
the star's edge.",2005-05-09T20:47:34Z
"Star counts in the Galaxy. Simulating from very deep to very shallow
  photometric surveys with the TRILEGAL code","We describe TRILEGAL, a new populations synthesis code for simulating the
stellar photometry of any Galaxy field. The code attempts to improve upon
several technical aspects of star count models, by: dealing with very complete
input libraries of evolutionary tracks; using a stellar spectral library to
simulate the photometry in any broad-band system; being very versatile allowing
easy changes in the input libraries and in the description of all of its
ingredients -- like the SFR, AMR, IMF, and geometry of Galaxy components. In a
previous paper (Groenewegen et al. 2002), the code was first applied to
describe the very deep star counts of the CDFS stellar catalogue. Here, we
briefly describe its initial calibration using EIS-deep and DMS star counts,
which are adequate samples to probe both the halo and the disc components of
largest scale heights (oldest ages). We then present the changes in the
calibration that were necessary to cope with some improvements in the model
input data, and the use of more extensive photometry datasets: the relatively
shallower 2MASS catalogue, which probes mostly the disc at intermediate ages,
and the immediate solar neighbourhood as sampled by Hipparcos, which contains a
somewhat larger fraction of younger stars than deeper surveys. Remarkably, the
same model calibration can reproduce well the star counts in all the
above-mentioned data sets, that span from the very deep magnitudes of CDFS
(16<R<23) to the very shallow ones of Hipparcos (V<8). Significant deviations
are found just for fields close to the Galactic Center and Plane, and for a
single set of South Galactic Pole data. The TRILEGAL code is ready to use for
the variety of wide-angle surveys in the optical/infrared that will become
available in the coming years.",2005-04-02T21:00:48Z
Carbon Abundances in the Galactic Thin and Thick Disks,"Although carbon is, together with oxygen and nitrogen, one of the most
important elements in the study of galactic chemical evolution its production
sites are still poorly known and have been much debated (see e.g. Gustafsson et
al. 1999; Chiappini et al. 2003). To trace the origin and evolution of carbon
we have determined carbon abundances from the forbidden [C I] line at 8727 A
and made comparisons to oxygen abundances from the forbidden [O I] line at 6300
A in a sample of 51 nearby F and G dwarf stars. These data and the fact that
the forbidden [C I] and [O I] lines are very robust abundance indicators (they
are essentially insensitive to deviations from LTE and uncertainties in the
stellar parameters, see, e.g., Gustafsson et al. 1999; Asplund et al. 2005)
enable us to very accurately measure the C/O ratio as well as individual C and
O abundances. Our first results indicate that the time-scale for the main
source that contribute to the carbon enrichment of the interstellar medium
operate on the same time-scale as those that contribute to the iron enrichment
(and can possibly be AGB stars...)",2005-06-07T15:09:18Z
Summary of ICGC04 Cosmology Workshop,"Cosmology is passing through a golden phase of rapid advance. The cosmology

"Enhanced abundances in three large-diameter mixed-morphology supernova
  remnants","We present an X-ray study of three mixed-morphology supernova remnants
(SNRs), HB 21, CTB 1 and HB 3, using archival ASCA and ROSAT data. These data
are complemented by archival Chandra X-ray Observatory data for CTB 1 and
XMM-Newton X-ray Observatory data for HB 3. The spectra from HB 21 and HB 3 are
well-described with a single-temperature thermal plasma in ionization
equilibrium, while a two-temperature thermal plasma is found in CTB 1. We found
enhanced abundances in all three SNRs. The elemental abundance of Mg is clearly
enhanced in CTB 1, while HB 21 has enhanced abundances of Si and S. The
situation is not so clear in HB 3 -- the plasma in this SNR either has
significantly enhanced abundances of O, Ne and Mg, or it has marginally
enhanced abundances of Mg and under-abundant Fe. We discuss the plausibility of
mixed-morphology SNR models for the three SNRs and the presence of enhanced
abundances. We revise a list of MM SNRs and their properties, compare the three
SNRs studied here with other members of this class, and discuss the presence of
enhanced elemental abundances in MM SNRs. We also report the ASCA detection of
a compact source in the southern part of HB 3. The source spectrum is
consistent with a power law with a photon index of ~2.7, and an unabsorbed
X-ray flux of ~10^{-12} erg/cm^2/s in the 0.5--10.0 keV band. The column
density towards this source differs from that towards the SNR, and it is
therefore unlikely they are related.",2005-05-24T20:16:44Z
"Multiwavelength Observations of 3C 66A during the WEBT campaign of 2003
  - 2004","The BL Lac object 3C 66A was the target of an extensive multiwavelength
monitoring campaign from July 2003 through April 2004, involving observations
throughout the electromagnetic spectrum. Radio, infrared, and optical
observations were carried out by the WEBT-ENIGMA collaboration. At higher
energies, 3C 66A was observed in X-rays (RXTE), and at very-high-energy (VHE)
gamma-rays (STACEE, VERITAS). In addition, the source has been observed with
the VLBA at 9 epochs throughout the period September 2003 - December 2004,
including 3 epochs contemporaneous with the core campaign.The WEBT campaign
revealed microvariability with flux changes of ~ 5 % on time scales as short as
\~ 2 hr. The source was in a relatively bright state, with several bright
flares on time scales of several days. The SED indicates a $\nu F_{\nu}$ peak
in the optical regime. A weak trend of optical spectral hysteresis with a trend
of spectral softening throughout both the rising and decaying phases, has been
found. The 3 - 10 keV X-ray flux of 3C 66A during the core campaign was
historically high and its spectrum very soft, indicating that the low-frequency
component of the broadband SED extends beyond ~ 10 keV. No significant X-ray
flux and/or spectral variability was detected. STACEE and Whipple observations
provided upper flux limits at > 150 GeV and > 390 GeV, respectively. The 22 and
43 GHz data from the 3 VLBA epochs between September 2003 and January 2004
indicate a smooth jet with only moderate internal structure. Evidence for
superluminal motion (8.5 +/- 5.6 h^{-1} c) was found in only one out of 6
components. The radial radio brightness profile suggests a magnetic field decay
$\propto r^{-1}$ and, thus, a predominantly perpendicular magnetic field.",2005-06-09T15:24:35Z
B335: A Laboratory for Astrochemistry in a Collapsing Cloud,"We present observations of 25 transitions of 17 isotopologues of 9 molecules
toward B335. With a goal of constraining chemical models of collapsing clouds,
we compare our observations, along with data from the literature, to models of
chemical abundances. The observed lines are simulated with a Monte Carlo code,
which uses various physical models of density and velocity as a function of
radius. The dust temperature as a function of radius is calculated
self-consistently by a radiative transfer code. The gas temperature is then
calculated at each radius, including gas-dust collisions, cosmic rays,
photoelectric heating, and molecular cooling. The results provide the input to
the Monte Carlo code. We consider both {\it ad hoc} step function models for
chemical abundances and abundances taken from a self-consistent modeling of the
evolution of a star-forming core. The step function models can match the
observed lines reasonably well, but they require very unlikely combinations of
radial variations in chemical abundances. Among the self-consistent chemical
models, the observed lines are matched best by models with somewhat enhanced
cosmic-ray ionization rates and sulfur abundances. We discuss briefly the steps
needed to close the loop on the modeling of dust and gas, including off-center
spectra of molecular lines.",2005-03-21T21:46:11Z
"Different Characteristics of the Bright Branches of the Globular
  Clusters M3 and M13","We carried out wide-field BVI CCD photometric observations of the GCs M3 and
M13 using the BOAO 1.8 m telescope equipped with a 2K CCD. We present CMDs of
M3 and M13. We have found AGB bumps at V = 14.85 for M3 at V = 14.25 for M13.
It is found that AGB stars in M3 are more concentrated near the bump, while
those in M13 are scattered along the AGB sequence. We identified the RGB bump
of M3 at V = 15.50 and that of M13 at V = 14.80. We have estimated the ratios R
and R2 for M3 and M13 and found that of R for M3 is larger than that for M13
while R2's for M3 and M13 are similar when only normal HB stars are used in R
and R2 for M13. However, we found that R's for M3 and M13 are similar while R2
for M3 is larger than that for M13 when all the HB stars are included in R and
R2 for M13. We have compared the observed RGB LFs of M3 and M13 with the
theoretical RGB LF of Bergbusch & VandenBerg at the same radial distances from
the cluster centers as used in R and R2 for M3 and M13. We found ""extra stars""
belonging to M13 in the comparison of the observed RGB LF of M13 and the
theoretical RGB LF of Bergbusch & VandenBerg. In the original definition of R
of Buzzoni et al., N(HB) corresponds to the lifetime of HB stars in the RR
Lyrae instability strip at log T_eff = 3.85. So, the smaller R value resulting
for M13 compared with that for M3 in the case where only normal HB stars are
included in R and R2 for M13 may be partially caused by ""extra stars"", and the
similar R's for M3 and M13 in the case where the all HB stars are included in R
and R2 for M13 may be caused by ""extra stars"" in the upper RGB of M13. If
""extra stars"" in the upper RGB of M13 are caused by an effective ""deep mixing""
these facts support the contention that an effective ""deep mixing"" could lead
to different HB morphologies between M3 and M13 and subsequent sequences.",2005-02-17T03:04:49Z
A case for nucleosynthesis in slowly evolving models,"We present a case for Cosmological Nucleosynthesis in an FRW universe in
which the scale factor expands linearly with time: $a(t) \sim t$. It is
demonstrated that adequate amount of $^4He$ requires a baryon density that
saturates mass bounds from galactic clusters. There is a collataral metallicity
production that is quite close to the lowest metallicity observed in metal poor
Pop II stars and clouds. On the other hand, sites for incipient low metallicity
(Pop II) starformation can support environments conducive to Deuterium
production up to levels observed in the universe. A profile of a revised
``Standard Cosmology'' is outlined.",2005-02-18T07:06:09Z
"Out of the darkness: the infrared afterglow of the INTEGRAL burst GRB
  040422 observed with the VLT","GRB 040422 was detected by the INTEGRAL satellite at an angle of only 3
degrees from the Galactic plane. Analysis of the prompt emission observed with
the SPI and IBIS instruments on INTEGRAL are presented. The IBIS spectrum is
well fit by the Band model with a break energy of Eo=56+/-2 keV and
Epeak=41+/-3 keV. The peak flux is 1.8 10^(-7) erg/cm2/s and fluence 3.4
10^(-7) erg/cm2 in the range 20-200 keV. We then present the observations of
the afterglow of GRB 040422, obtained with the ISAAC and FORS 2 instruments at
the VLT less than 2 hours after the burst. We report the discovery of its
near-infrared afterglow, for which we give here the astrometry and photometry.
No detection could have been obtained in the R and I bands, partly due to the
large extinction in the Milky Way. We re-imaged the position of the afterglow
two months later in the Ks band, and detected a likely bright host galaxy. We
compare the magnitude of the afterglow with a those of a compilation of
promptly observed counterparts of previous GRBs, and show that the afterglow of
GRB 040422 lies at the very faint end of the distribution, brighter only than
that of GRB 021211, singled out later and in the optical bands, and GRB 040924
after accounting for Milky Way extinction. This observation suggests that the
proportion of dark GRBs can be significantly lowered by a more systematic use
of 8-m class telescopes in the infrared in the very early hours after the
burst.",2005-03-31T08:34:44Z
"UHE Leptons and Neutrons feeding Precessing gamma Jet in GRBs - SGRs: A
  SGR 1806-20 link to EeV C.R.?","Soft Gamma Repeaters are widely believed to occur as isotropic Magnetar
explosion. We suggest on the contrary that they may be described by thin
collimated spinning and precessing Gamma Jets flashing and blazing along the
line of sight. The Jet (for SGRs) maybe powered by an accretion disk in binary
system and it reproduces huge outflow and oscillating blazing mode as the
observed ones in Giant Flare SGR 1806-20. The precessing and spinning blazing
nature reflects at smaller intensity the same behavior observed in brief GRBs
Jetted Supernova, as well as re-brightening and bumps in afterglows. The SGR
gamma beam maybe powered by Inverse Compton Scattering or by Synchrotron
Radiation of electron pair beam respectively at GeVs or PeVs energies. In the
latter case tens PeVs leptons (muons and later decaying PeVs electrons) might
be originated while EeV nucleons Jets (protons-neutrons) are in photo-pion
equilibrium with infrared photons surrounding the source. The neutron Jet might
survive and remain collimated. It maybe already detected as an EeV cosmic ray
anisotropy in present AGASA map pointing toward known (North Hemisphere) SGRs :
SGR 1900 +14 and SGR 1806-20. If the SGR-EeV connection is correct a parasite
traces of PeVs neutrino as well PeV-TeVs gamma rays might be found in present
or future data records, among the others C.R. array detectors, inside the
Amanda and Milagro volumes.",2005-05-09T13:53:47Z
"Soft X-ray and Ultraviolet Emission Relations in Optically Selected AGN
  Samples","Using a sample of 228 optically selected Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in the
0.01-6.3 redshift range with a high fraction of X-ray detections (81-86%), we
study the relation between rest-frame UV and soft X-ray emission and its
evolution with cosmic time. The majority of the AGNs in our sample (155
objects) have been selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in an
unbiased way, rendering the sample results representative of all SDSS AGNs. The
addition of two heterogeneous samples of 36 high-redshift and 37 low-redshift
AGNs further supports and extends our conclusions. We confirm that the X-ray
emission from AGNs is correlated with their UV emission, and that the ratio of
the monochromatic luminosity emitted at 2keV compared to 2500A decreases with
increasing luminosity (a_ox=-0.136 l_uv+2.616, where l_uv is in log units), but
does not change with cosmic time. These results apply to intrinsic AGN
emission, as we correct or control for the effects of the host galaxy, UV/X-ray
absorption, and any X-ray emission associated with radio emission in AGNs. We
investigate a variety of systematic errors and can thereby state with
confidence that (1) the a_ox-l_uv anti-correlation is real and not a result of
accumulated systematic errors and (2) any a_ox dependence on redshift is
negligible in comparison. We provide the best quantification of the a_ox-l_uv
relation to date for normal radio-quiet AGNs; this should be of utility for
researchers pursuing a variety of studies.",2005-03-01T04:21:01Z
Prospects for Redshifted 21-cm observations of quasar HII regions,"The introduction of low-frequency radio arrays over the coming decade is
expected to revolutionize the study of the reionization epoch. Observation of
the contrast in redshifted 21cm emission between a large HII region and the
surrounding neutral IGM will be the simplest and most easily interpreted
signature. We find that an instrument like the planned Mileura Widefield Array
Low-Frequency Demonstrator (LFD) will be able to obtain good signal to noise on
HII regions around the most luminous quasars, and determine some gross
geometric properties, e.g. whether the HII region is spherical or conical. A
hypothetical follow-up instrument with 10 times the collecting area of the LFD
(MWA-5000) will be capable of mapping the detailed geometry of HII regions,
while SKA will be capable of detecting very narrow spectral features as well as
the sharpness of the HII region boundary. The MWA-5000 will discover
serendipitous HII regions in widefield observations. We estimate the number of
HII regions which are expected to be generated by quasars. Assuming a late
reionization at z~6 we find that there should be several tens of quasar HII
regions larger than 4Mpc at z~6-8 per field of view. Identification of HII
regions in forthcoming 21cm surveys can guide a search for bright galaxies in
the middle of these regions. Most of the discovered galaxies would be the
massive hosts of dormant quasars that left behind fossil HII cavities that
persisted long after the quasar emission ended, owing to the long recombination
time of intergalactic hydrogen. A snap-shot survey of candidate HII regions
selected in redshifted 21cm image cubes may prove to be the most efficient
method for finding very high redshift quasars and galaxies.",2005-06-02T04:27:16Z
"The Size of the Radio-Emitting Region in Low-luminosity Active Galactic
  Nuclei","We have used the VLA to study radio variability among a sample of 18 low
luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs), on time scales of a few hours to 10
days. The goal was to measure or limit the sizes of the LLAGN radio-emitting
regions, in order to use the size measurements as input to models of the radio
emission mechanisms in LLAGNs. We detect variability on typical time scales of
a few days, at a confidence level of 99%, in half of the target galaxies.
Either variability that is intrinsic to the radio emitting regions, or that is
caused by scintillation in the Galactic interstellar medium, is consistent with
the data. For either interpretation, the brightness temperature of the emission
is below the inverse-Compton limit for all of our LLAGNs, and has a mean value
of about 1E10 K. The variability measurements plus VLBI upper limits imply that
the typical angular size of the LLAGN radio cores at 8.5 GHz is 0.2
milliarcseconds, plus or minus a factor of two. The ~ 1E10 K brightness
temperature strongly suggests that a population of high-energy nonthermal
electrons must be present, in addition to a hypothesized thermal population in
an accretion flow, in order to produce the observed radio emission.",2005-04-04T14:15:43Z
"Contribution of pulsars to the gamma-ray background and their
  observation with the space telescopes GLAST and AGILE","Luminosities and uxes of the expected population of galactic gamma-ray
pulsars become foreseeable if physical distributions at birth and evolutive
history are assigned. In this work we estimate the contribution of pulsar uxes
to the gamma-ray background, which has been measured by the EGRET experiment on
board of the CGRO. For pulsar luminosities we select some of the most important
gamma-ray emission models, taking into account both polar cap and outer gap
scenarios. We nd that this contribution strongly depends upon controversial
neutron star birth properties. A comparison between our simulation results and
EGRET data is presented for each model, nding an average contribution of about
10%. In addition, we perform the calculation of the number of new gamma-ray
pulsars detectable by GLAST and AGILE, showing a remarkable di erence between
the two classes of models. Finally, we suggest some improvements in the
numerical code, including more sophisticated galactic m odels and di erent
populations of pulsars like binaries, milliseconds, anomalous pulsars and
magnetars.",2005-03-24T14:31:43Z
"Simulation of the Gravitational Collapse and Fragmentation of Rotating
  Molecular Clouds","In this paper we study the process of the subsequent (runaway) fragmentation
of the rotating isothermal Giant Molecular Cloud (GMC) complex. Our own
developed Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) gas-dynamical model
successfully reproduce the observed Cloud Mass-distribution Function (CMF) in
our Galaxy (even the differences between the inner and outer parts of our
Galaxy). The steady state CMF is established during the collapse within a
free-fall timescale of the GMC. We show that one of the key parameters, which
defines the observed slope of the present day CMF, is the initial ratio of the
rotational (turbulent) and gravitational energy inside the fragmented GMC.",2005-06-08T15:44:07Z
"2D Simulations of the Line-Driven Instability in Hot-Star Winds: II.
  Approximations for the 2D Radiation Force","We present initial attempts to include the multi-dimensional nature of
radiation transport in hydrodynamical simulations of the small-scale structure
that arises from the line-driven instability in hot-star winds. Compared to
previous 1D or 2D models that assume a purely radial radiation force, we seek
additionally to treat the lateral momentum and transport of diffuse
line-radiation, initially here within a 2D context. A key incentive is to study
the damping effect of the associated diffuse line-drag on the dynamical
properties of the flow, focusing particularly on whether this might prevent
lateral break-up of shell structures at scales near the lateral Sobolev angle
of ca. $1^{\rm o}$. We first explore nonlinear simulations that cast the
lateral diffuse force in the simple, local form of a parallel viscosity.
Second, to account for the lateral mixing of radiation associated with the
radial driving, we next explore models in which the radial force is azimuthally
smoothed over a chosen scale. Third, to account for both the lateral line-drag
and the lateral mixing in a more self-consistent way, we explore further a
method first proposed by Owocki (1999), which uses a restricted 3-ray approach
that combines a radial ray with two oblique rays set to have an impact
parameter $p < R_{\ast}$ within the stellar core. From numerical simulations,
we find that, compared to equivalent 1-ray simulations, the high-resolution
3-ray models show systematically a much higher lateral coherence.... (Full

"Radio continuum and far-infrared emission from the galaxies in the
  Eridanus group","The Eridanus galaxies follow the well-known radio-FIR correlation. Majority
(70%) of these galaxies have their star formation rates below that of the Milky
Way. The galaxies having a significant excess of radio emission are identified
as low luminosity AGNs based on their radio morphologies obtained from the GMRT
observations. There are no powerful AGNs (L{20cm} > 10^{23} W Hz^{-1}) in the
group. The two most far-infrared and radio luminous galaxies in the group have
optical and HI morphologies suggestive of recent tidal interactions. The
Eridanus group also has two far-infrared luminous but radio-deficient galaxies.
It is believed that these galaxies are observed within a few Myr of the onset
of an intense star formation episode after being quiescent for at least a 100
Myr. The upper end of the radio luminosity distribution of the Eridanus
galaxies (L_{20cm} ~ 10^{22} W Hz^{-1}) is consistent with that of the field
galaxies, other groups, and late-type galaxies in nearby clusters.",2005-03-24T15:00:21Z
"Early optical-IR emission from GRB 041219a: neutron-rich internal shocks
  and a mildly magnetized external reverse shock","Very early optical and near infrared (IR) emission was discovered
accompanying the long gamma-ray burst (GRB) 041219a. We show that the
optical/IR flash tracking the gamma-ray lightcurve during the prompt emission
could be understood as emission from neutron-rich internal shocks, as has been
suggested by Fan & Wei. The early K_s-band afterglow lightcurve after the
prompt phase could be well-modeled as the superposition of a reverse shock and
a forward shock component. The radio data also support the reverse shock
interpretation.",2005-04-06T22:36:48Z
A New Milky Way Dwarf Galaxy in Ursa Major,"In this Letter, we report the discovery of a new dwarf satellite to the Milky
Way, located at ($\alpha_{2000}, \delta_{2000}$) $=$ (158.72,51.92) in the
constellation of Ursa Major. This object was detected as an overdensity of red,
resolved stars in Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. The color-magnitude diagram of
the Ursa Major dwarf looks remarkably similar to that of Sextans, the lowest
surface brightness Milky Way companion known, but with approximately an order
of magnitude fewer stars. Deeper follow-up imaging confirms this object has an
old and metal-poor stellar population and is $\sim$ 100 kpc away. We roughly
estimate M$_V =$ -6.75 and $r_{1/2} =$ 250 pc for this dwarf. Its luminosity is
several times fainter than the faintest known Milky Way dwarf. However, its
physical size is typical for dSphs. Even though its absolute magnitude and size
are presently quite uncertain, Ursa Major is likely the lowest luminosity and
lowest surface brightness galaxy yet known.",2005-03-25T15:41:12Z
Black Hole Shadows of Charged Spinning Black Holes,"We propose a method for measuring the black hole charge by imaging a black
hole shadow in a galactic center by future interferometers. Even when the black
hole is uncharged, it is possible to confirm the charge neutrality by this
method. We first derive the analytic formulae of the black hole shadow in an
optically thin medium around a charged spinning black hole, and then
investigate how contours of the black hole shadow depend on the spin and the
charge of the black hole for several inclination angles between the rotation
axis of the black hole and the observer. This method only assumes stationary
black hole and general relativity. By fitting the formula of the contours of
the shadow to the observed image of the shadow, in addition to the black hole
charge, one can also determine the black hole spin and the inclination angle
without any degeneracy among the charge, the spin, and the inclination angle
unless the inclination angle is null.",2005-05-16T07:42:08Z
Flares observed with XMM-Newton and the VLA,"We present lightcurves obtained in X-ray by the XMM-Newton EPIC cameras and
simultaneous radio lightcurves obtained with the VLA for five active M-type
flare stars. A number of flare events were observed, and by comparing radio
with X-ray data, we consider various possible flare mechanisms. In cases where
there seems to be a clear correlation between radio and X-ray activity, we use
an energy budget argument to show that the heating which leads to the X-ray
emission could be due to the same particles emitting in the radio. In cases
where there is radio activity without corresponding X-ray activity, we argue
that the radio emission is likely to arise from coherent processes involving
comparatively few particles. In one case, we are able to show from polarization
of the radio emission that this is almost certainly the case. Cases for which
X-ray activity is seen without corresponding radio activity are more difficult
to explain. We suggest that the heating particles may be accelerated to very
high energy, and the resulting synchrotron radio emission may be beamed in
directions other than the line of sight.",2005-03-01T16:12:52Z
"Observed Properties of Exoplanets: Masses, Orbits, and Metallicities","We review the observed properties of exoplanets found by the Doppler
technique which has revealed 152 exoplanets to date. We focus on our ongoing
18-year survey of 1330 FGKM type stars at Lick, Keck, and the Anglo-Australian
Telescopes carried out with a uniform Doppler precision of 3 m/s. The 104
planets detected in our survey have masses as low as 15 M_Earth orbiting
between 0.03 and 5.5 AU. The mass distribution rises toward the lowest
detectable masses as dN/dM is proportional to M^-1.1. Nearly all giant planets
orbiting within 2 AU of all FGK stars within 30 pc have now been discovered.
The distribution of semi-major axes rises from 0.3 -- 3.0 AU (in bins of Delta
log a), but remains unknown for larger orbits. Extrapolation suggests that 12%
of the FGK stars harbor exoplanets within 20 AU. The median orbital
eccentricity is <e>=0.25 (excluding those tidally circularized), lower than
previously measured . Planets orbiting beyond 3 AU continue to exhibit non-zero
eccentricity, suggesting that the circular orbits of giant planets in our Solar
System are unusual. The occurrence rate of ``hot Jupiters'' within 0.1 AU is
1.2$\pm$0.3 %. The probability of occurrence of planets varies as the square of
the stellar metal abundance, $P \propto N^2_Fe, ranging from $<$3% for stars of
subsolar metallicity to 25% for stars with [Fe/H] > +0.3. Nearly 14% of
planet-bearing stars harbor multiple-planet systems, occasionally locked in
resonances. Kepler and Corot should measure the occurrence of earth-sized
planets. The Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) will detect planets with masses
as low as 3 M_ Earth orbiting within 2 AU of nearby stars and will measure
masses, orbits and multiplicity. These candidate rocky planets will motivate
spectroscopic follow-up by the ``Terrestrial Planet Finder'' and Darwin.}",2005-04-29T23:38:45Z
Power of a Turbulent Pulsar,"We speculate that stationary force-free pulsar magnetospheres are screw
unstable, and the spin-down power of real pulsars is carried by turbulent
Poynting jets. The turbulent jet entrains poloidal flux as it propagates away
from the star. Due to poloidal flux entrainment, poloidal field inside the jet
decreases at a slower rate than the dipole's $r^{-3}$, and the pulsar power
increases accordingly: $L\sim (\mu ^2\Omega^4/c^3)(\Omega R/c)^{-\alpha}$,
where $\mu$ is the magnetic dipole, $\Omega$ is the frequency, $R$ is the
neutron star radius, and $\alpha \lesssim 1$ is an index which depends on
spin-dipole angle. Our speculation is of interest because it seems to provide
the only possible explanation (without fine-tuning) of observed pulsar braking
indices.",2005-02-28T01:36:28Z
"Spectrophotometry of Sextans A and B: Chemical Abundances of HII Regions
  and Planetary Nebulae","We present the results of high quality long-slit spectroscopy of planetary
nebulae (PNe) and HII regions in the two dwarf irregular galaxies Sextans A and
B, which belong to a small group of galaxies just outside the Local Group. In
Sextans A we obtained the element abundances in its only known PN and in three
HII regions with the classical Te method. The oxygen abundances in these three
HII regions of Sextans A are all consistent within the individual rms
uncertainties, with the average 12+log(O/H) = 7.54+/-0.06. The oxygen abundance
of the PN in Sextans A is, however, significantly higher: 12+$\log$(O/H) =
8.02+/-0.05. This PN is even more enriched in nitrogen and helium, suggesting a
classification as a PN of Type I. In Sextans B we obtained spectra of one PN
and six HII regions. Element abundances with the Te method could be derived for
the PN and three of the HII regions. For two of these HII regions, which have a
separation of only ~70 pc in projection, the oxygen abundances do not differ
within the rms uncertainties, with a mean of 12+log(O/H) = 7.53+/-0.05. The
third HII region, which is about 0.6 kpc northeast from the former two, is
twice as metal-rich, with 12+log(O/H) = 7.84+/-0.05. This suggests considerable
inhomogeneity in the present-day metallicity distribution in Sextans B.

"The WEBT campaign to observe AO 0235+16 in the 2003-2004 observing
  season","A multiwavelength campaign on the BL Lac object AO 0235+16 has been organized
by the WEBT collaboration during the observing seasons 2003-2004 and 2004-2005.
Here we report on the results of the first season, which saw the participation
of 24 optical and near-IR telescopes and 4 radio telescopes, as well as the
first XMM-Newton pointing, which occurred on January 18-19, 2004. Unpublished
data from previous epochs were also collected. In the optical and near-IR the
source has been very active in the last 3 years, though rather faint most of
the time, with noticeable variations of more than a mag in a few days. In
contrast, in the radio bands it appears ""quiescent"" since early 2000. The X-ray
spectra obtained by the three EPIC detectors are well fitted by a power law
with extra-absorption at z=0.524. No significant variation of the X-ray flux
occurred during the pointing. In contrast, contemporaneous dense radio
monitoring with the 100 m telescope at Effelsberg shows a ~2-3% flux decrease
in 6-7 hours, which, if intrinsic, would imply a brightness temperature well
above the Compton limit. We construct the broad-band spectral energy
distribution of January 18-19, 2004 with simultaneous radio data from
Effelsberg, optical data from the Nordic Optical Telescope, optical-UV data
from the Optical Monitor onboard XMM-Newton, and X-ray data by the EPIC
instruments. Particular care was taken to correct data for extinction due to
both the Milky Way and the z=0.524 absorber. The resulting SED suggests the
existence of a bump in the UV spectral region.",2005-03-15T11:01:19Z
Relativistic SPH Calculations of Compact Binary Mergers,"We review recent progress in understanding the hydrodynamics of compact
binary mergers using relativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) codes.
Recent results are discussed for both double neutron stars and black hole -
neutron star binaries. The gravitational wave signals from these mergers
contain a lot of information about the masses and radii of the stars and the
equation of state of the neutron star fluid. For black hole - neutron star
mergers, the final fate of the fluid and the gravitational wave emission depend
strongly on the mass ratio and the black hole spin.",2005-03-01T03:59:05Z

"Observations of the binary pulsar system PSR B1718-19 -- The Role of
  Tidal Circularisation","We present optical and infrared observations taken with the Very Large
Telescope of the eclipsing binary pulsar system PSR B1718-19. The candidate
companion of the pulsar, identified earlier in Hubble Space Telescope
observations, has been detected in all three bands, R, I, and J. These
detections allowed us to derive constraints on temperature, radius, and mass,
pointing to a companion that has expanded to a radius between one of a main
sequence star and one at the Roche-limit. We focus on the role of tidal
circularisation in the system, which will have transformed the initially
eccentric orbit expected from formation scenarios into the nearly circular
orbit presently observed. Based on simple energy balance arguments, we are able
to draw a picture of the companion's evolution resulting from the energy
deposition in the star due to circularisation. In this picture, our measurement
of the companion's parameters is consistent with the expected initial
eccentricity. However, with the present understanding of tidal dissipation it
remains difficult to account for the short time in which the system was
circularised.",2005-04-11T04:24:20Z
"Kelvin Helmholtz Instability and Circulation Transfer at an
  Isotropic-Anisotropic Superfluid Interface in a Neutron Star","A recent laboratory experiment (Blaauwgeers et al. 2003) suggests that a
Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability at the interface between two superfluids, one
rotating and anisotropic, the other stationary and isotropic, may trigger
sudden spin-up of the stationary superfluid. This result suggests that a KH
instability at the crust-core ($^1S_0$-$^3P_2$-superfluid) boundary of a
neutron star may provide a trigger mechanism for pulsar glitches. We calculate
the dispersion relation of the KH instability involving two different
superfluids including the normal fluid components and their effects on
stability, particularly entropy transport. We show that an entropy difference
between the core and crust superfluids reduces the threshold differential shear
velocity and threshold crust-core density ratio. We evaluate the wavelength of
maximum growth of the instability for neutron star parameters and find the
resultant circulation transfer to be within the range observed in pulsar
glitches.",2005-05-26T10:02:01Z
Cluster scaling and its redshift evolution from XMM-Newton,"We put together the results of XMM-Newton observations of a number of
representative group and cluster samples at low and high redshifts. These
results confirm the entropy ramp as an explanation of the observed scaling
relations. We observe a mild evolution in the entropy of clusters. The observed
degree of evolution is consistent with expectations of the shock heating at a
fixed overdensity (500) with respect to the critical density in LCDM. The study
of the evolution in the pressure scaling imposes strong requirements in the
definition of the average temperature of the cluster. The scaling temperature
should be consistent to better than the 10% level. Once such a consistency is
achieved, no additional evolution in the pressure has been detected in addition
to the prediction of the shock heating in the LCDM Universe.",2005-05-19T20:00:00Z
"Are radio galaxies and quiescent galaxies different? Results from the
  analysis of HST brightness profiles","We present a study of the optical brightness profiles of early type galaxies,
using a number of samples of radio galaxies and optically selected elliptical
galaxies. For the radio galaxy samples--B2 of Fanaroff-Riley type I and 3C of
Fanaroff-Riley type II-- we determined a number of parameters that describe a
""Nuker-law"" profile, which were compared with those already known for the
optically selected objects. We find that radio active galaxies are always of
the ""core"" type (i.e. an inner Nuker law slope gamma < 0.3). However, there are
core-type galaxies which harbor no significant radio source and which are
indistinguishable from the radio active galaxies. We do not find any radio
detected galaxy with a power law profile (gamma > 0.5). This difference is not
due to any effect with absolute magnitude, since in a region of overlap in
magnitude the dichotomy between radio active and radio quiescent galaxies
remains. We speculate that core-type objects represent the galaxies that have
been, are, or may become, radio active at some stage in their lives; active and
non-active core-type galaxies are therefore identical in all respects except
their eventual radio-activity: on HST scales we do not find any relationship
between boxiness and radio-activity. There is a fundamental plane, defined by
the parameters of the core (break radius r_b and break brightness mu_b), which
is seen in the strong correlation between r_b and mu_b. The break radius is
also linearly proportional to the optical Luminosity in the $I$ band. Moreover,
for the few galaxies with an independently measured black hole mass, the break
radius turns out to be tightly correlated with M_{BH}. The black hole mass
correlates even better with the combination of fundamental plane parameters r_b
and mu_b, which represents the central velocity dispersion.",2005-05-18T09:01:44Z
Reconstruction of Objects by Direct Demodulation,"High resolution reconstruction of complicated objects from incomplete and
noisy data can be achieved by solving modulation equations iteratively under
physical constraints. This direct demodulation method is a powerful technique
for dealing with inverse problem in general case. Spectral and image
restorations and computerized tomography are only particular cases of general
demodulation. It is possible to reconstruct an object in higher dimensional
space from observations by a simple lower dimensional instrument through direct
demodulation. Our simulations show that wide field and high resolution images
of space hard X-rays and soft gamma rays can be obtained by a collimated
non-position-sensitive detector without coded aperture masks.",2005-03-06T08:19:48Z
"The Sgr B2 X-ray Echo of the Galactic Center Supernova Explosion that
  Produced Sgr A East","The possible impact Sgr A East is having on the Galactic center has fueled
speculation concerning its age and the energetics of the supernova explosion
that produced it. We have carried out the first in-depth analysis of the
remnant's evolution and its various interactions: with the stellar winds
flowing out from the inner ~2 pc, with the supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, and
with the 50 km/s molecular cloud behind and to the East of the nucleus. We have
found that a rather ""standard"" supernova explosion with energy ~1.5e51 ergs is
sufficient to create the remnant we see today, and that the latter is probably
only ~1,700 years old. The X-ray Ridge between ~9"" and 15"" to the NE of Sgr A*
appears to be the product of the current interaction between the remaining
supernova ejecta and the outflowing winds. Perhaps surprisingly, we have also
found that the passage of the remnant across the black hole would have enhanced
the accretion rate onto the central object by less than a factor 2. Such a
small increase cannot explain the current Fe fluorescence observed from the
molecular cloud Sgr B2; this fluorescence would have required an increase in
Sgr A*'s luminosity by 6 orders of magnitude several hundred years ago.
Instead, we have uncovered what appears to be a more plausible scenario for
this transient irradiation--the interaction between the expanding remnant and
the 50 km/s molecular cloud. The first impact would have occurred about 1,200
years after the explosion, producing a 2-200 keV luminosity of ~1e39 ergs/s.
During the intervening 300-400 years, the dissipation of kinetic energy
subsided considerably, leading to the much lower luminosity (~1e36 ergs/s at
2-10 keV) we see today.",2005-06-10T18:22:49Z
"The VIMOS VLT Deep Survey - Evolution of the luminosity functions by
  galaxy type up to z=1.5 from first epoch data","From the first epoch observations of the VVDS up to z=1.5 we have derived
luminosity functions (LF) of different spectral type galaxies. The VVDS data,
covering ~70% of the life of the Universe, allow for the first time to study
from the same sample and with good statistical accuracy the evolution of the
LFs by galaxy type in several rest frame bands from a purely magnitude selected
sample. The magnitude limit of the VVDS allows the determination of the faint
end slope of the LF with unprecedented accuracy. Galaxies have been classified
in four spectral classes, using their colours and redshift, and LFs have been
derived in the U, B, V, R and I rest frame bands from z=0.05 to z=1.5. We find
a significant steepening of the LF going from early to late types. The M*
parameter is significantly fainter for late type galaxies and this difference
increases in the redder bands. Within each of the galaxy spectral types we find
a brightening of M* with increasing redshift, ranging from =< 0.5 mag for early
type galaxies to ~1 mag for the latest type galaxies, while the slope of the LF
of each spectral type is consistent with being constant with redshift. The LF
of early type galaxies is consistent with passive evolution up to z~1.1, while
the number of bright early type galaxies has decreased by ~40% from z~0.3 to
z~1.1. We also find a strong evolution in the normalization of the LF of latest
type galaxies, with an increase of more than a factor 2 from z~0.3 to z~1.3:
the density of bright late type galaxies in the same redshift range increases
of a factor ~6.6. These results indicate a strong type-dependent evolution and
identifies the latest spectral types as responsible for most of the evolution
of the UV-optical luminosity function out to z=1.5.",2005-06-16T18:46:15Z
Gamma-Ray Bursts from quark stars,"Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to be related to the explosion of
type Ic supernovae, which have been stripped of their hydrogen and helium
envelopes. There appear to be two types of these explosions: those which are
approximately spherical (GRB980425/1998bw), and which are associated with weak
bursts, and the classical GRBs which generate ultrarelativistic jets
(GRB030329/SN2003dh). If this bimodality is real Swift will provide a clear
evidence for it.
  We propose that classical powerful GRBs, which generate ultrarelativistic
outflows, are a result of a formation of quark stars. Quark stars may provide
an additional energy for the explosion of SN Ic, but far more important is a
creation of a surface which acts as a membrane which cannot be penetrated by
baryons. A surface of a quark star allows only ultrarelativistic matter to
escape: photons, neutrinos, electron -- positron pairs and magnetic fields. The
formation of a quark star follows the initial core collapse in several minutes.
Possible evidence for this time delay is provided by BATSE precursors to GRBs,
as analyzed by Lazzati (2005).",2005-02-15T16:09:37Z
Evidence of a counterrotating core in the Large Magellanic Cloud,"Stellar radial velocity in the central region of the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC) is used to estimate the radial velocity curve along various position
angles (PA) including the line of nodes (LON). The central part of the radial
velocity profile, along the LON, shows a V-shaped profile - a clear indication
of counterrotation. The counterrotating region and the secondary bar have
similar location and PA. The origin of the counter-rotating core could be
internal(secondary bar) or external(accretion). To explain the observed
velocity profile, we propose the existence of two disks in the inner LMC, with
one counterrotating. This two disk model is found to match the HI velocities as
well. Two disks with different LON and velocity profiles can create regions
which are kinematically and spatially separated. Predicted such locations are
found to match the observed locations where the HI clouds are found to have two
velocities.",2005-03-29T04:18:12Z
"Detectable neutrino fluxes due to enhanced cosmic ray densities in the
  Galactic Center region","We examine in detail the detectability of a signal of diffuse high energy
neutrinos produced in the Milky Way by the interaction of cosmic rays (CRs)
with the interstellar medium (ISM). We show that highly inhomogeneous galactic
CR densities arise naturally from large scale drift effects and the
inhomogeneous distribution of CR sources. In particular, the CR density in the
Galactic Center region (where the ISM density is maximal) could be an order of
magnitude larger than the local CR density. Hence, the expected diffuse flux of
neutrinos from the Galactic Center region becomes enhanced and could be
detected at energies above $\sim 10^4$ GeV in a km$^3$-size neutrino telescope
within 10 years of operation. The galactic anisotropy, which is the main
signature of this flux, allows to discriminate this signal from other possible
extraterrestrial diffuse fluxes of high energy neutrinos.",2005-05-17T12:00:29Z
"Concentration of toroidal magnetic field in the solar tachocline by
  eta-quenching","We show that if the turbulent magnetic diffusivity used in solar dynamos is
assumed to be 'quenched' by increasing toroidal fields, much larger amplitude
and more concentrated toroidal fields can be induced by differential rotation
from an assumed poloidal field than if there is no quenching. This
amplification and concentration mechanism is weakened and bounded by j x B
feedbacks on the differential rotation. Nevertheless, it is strong enough to
contribute to the creation of ~100 kG toroidal fields near the base of the
convection zone, perhaps in conjunction with the 'exploding flux tube' process.
Such high fields are necessary for sunspots to occur in low solar latitudes.",2005-03-31T22:58:09Z
"High Orbital Eccentricities of Extrasolar Planets Induced by the Kozai
  Mechanism","One of the most remarkable properties of extrasolar planets is their high
orbital eccentricities. Observations have shown that at least 20% of these
planets, including some with particularly high eccentricities, are orbiting a
component of a wide binary star system. The presence of a distant binary
companion can cause significant secular perturbations to the orbit of a planet.
In particular, at high relative inclinations, a planet can undergo a
large-amplitude eccentricity oscillation. This so-called ""Kozai mechanism"" is
effective at a very long range, and its amplitude is purely dependent on the
relative orbital inclination. In this paper, we address the following simple
question: assuming that every host star with a detected giant planet also has a
(possibly unseen, e.g., substellar) distant companion, with reasonable
distributions of orbital parameters and masses, how well could secular
perturbations reproduce the observed eccentricity distribution of planets? Our
calculations show that the Kozai mechanism consistently produces an excess of
planets with very high (e >0.6) and very low (e < 0.1) eccentricities. The
paucity of near-circular orbits in the observed sample cannot be explained
solely by the Kozai mechanism, because, even with high enough inclinations, the
Kozai mechanism often fails to produce significant eccentricity perturbations
when there are other competing sources of orbital perturbations on secular
timescales, such as general relativity. On the other hand, the Kozai mechanism
can produce many highly eccentric orbits. Indeed the overproduction of high
eccentricities observed in our models could be combined with plausible
circularizing mechanisms (e.g., friction from residual gas) to create more
intermediate eccentricities (e=0.1-0.6).",2005-02-21T10:36:24Z
An Infrared Coronagraphic Survey for Substellar Companions,"We have used the F160W filter (1.4-1.8 um) and the coronagraph on the
Near-InfraRed Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) on the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) to survey 45 single stars with a median age of 0.15 Gyr, an
average distance of 30 pc, and an average H-magnitude of 7 mag. For the median
age we were capable of detecting a 30 M_Jup companion at separations between 15
and 200 AU. A 5 M_Jup object could have been detected at 30 AU around 36% of
our primaries. For several of our targets that were less than 30 Myr old, the
lower mass limit was as low as a Jupiter mass, well into the high mass planet
region. Results of the entire survey include the proper motion verification of
five low-mass stellar companions, two brown dwarfs (HR7329B and TWA5B) and one
possible brown dwarf binary (Gl 577B/C).",2005-06-15T22:32:01Z
The broadening of Fe II lines by neutral hydrogen collisions,"Data for the broadening of 24188 Fe II lines by collisions with neutral
hydrogen atoms have been computed using the theory of Anstee & O'Mara as
extended to singly ionised species and higher orbital angular momentum states
by Barklem & O'Mara. Data have been computed for all Fe II lines between
observed energy levels in the line lists of Kurucz with log gf > -5 for which
the theory is applicable. The variable energy debt parameter Ep used in
computing the second order perturbation theory potential is chosen to be
consistent with the long range dispersion interaction constant C6 computed
using the f-values from Kurucz.",2005-02-04T13:06:08Z
Inhomogeneous models of interacting dark matter and dark energy,"We derive and analyze a class of spherically symmetric cosmological models
whose source is an interactive mixture of inhomogeneous cold dark matter (DM)
and a generic homogeneous dark energy (DE) fluid. If the DE fluid corresponds
to a quintessense scalar field, the interaction term can be associated with a
well motivated non--minimal coupling to the DM component. By constructing a
suitable volume average of the DM component we obtain a Friedman evolution
equation relating this average density with an average Hubble scalar, with the
DE component playing the role of a repulsive and time-dependent $\Lambda$ term.
Once we select an ``equation of state'' linking the energy density ($\mu$) and
pressure ($p$) of the DE fluid, as well as a free function governing the radial
dependence, the models become fully determinate and can be applied to known
specific DE sources, such as quintessense scalar fields or tachyonic fluids.
Considering the simple equation of state $p= (\gamma-1) \mu$ with $0\leq\gamma
<2/3$, we show that the free parameters and boundary conditions can be selected
for an adequate description of a local DM overdensity evolving in a suitable
cosmic background that accurately fits current observational data. While a DE
dominated scenario emerges in the asymptotic future, with total $\Omega$ and
$q$ tending respectively to 1 and -1/2 for all cosmic observers, the effects of
inhomogeneity and anisotropy yield different local behavior and evolution rates
for these parameters in the local overdense region. We suggest that the models
presented can be directly applied to explore the effects of various DE
formalisms on local DM cosmological inhomogeneities.",2005-03-29T06:14:46Z
A Catalog of Distant Compact Groups Using DPOSS,"In this paper we present an objectively defined catalog of 459 small, high
density groups of galaxies out to z~0.2 in a region of 6260 square degrees in
the northern sky derived from the Digitized Second Palomar Observatory Sky
Survey. Our catalog extends down to r = 19.0 and has a median redshift of z_med
= 0.12, making it complementary to Hickson's catalog for the nearby universe
(z_med = 0.03). The depth and angular coverage of this catalog makes it
valuable for studies of the general characteristics of small groups of galaxies
and how galaxies evolve in and around them. We also examine the relationship
between compact groups and large scale structure.",2005-04-11T17:58:08Z
"Discovery of an extended halo of metal-poor stars in the Andromeda
  spiral galaxy","Understanding galaxy formation involves look-back and fossil-record studies
of distant and nearby galaxies, respectively. Debris trails in our Galaxy's
spheroidal halo of old stars provide evidence of ""bottom-up"" formation via
tidal disruption/merging of dwarf satellite galaxies, but it is difficult to
study our Galaxy's large-scale structure from within. Studies of our
neighbouring Andromeda galaxy have concluded that its spheroid contains
chemically enriched (""metal-rich"") stars out to a radius of 30 kiloparsecs with
an exponential r^1/4 fall-off in density thereby resembling a galactic ""bulge"".
Were Andromeda's true halo to be found, our detailed yet global view of its
stellar dynamics, substructure, chemical abundance, and age distribution would
directly constrain hierarchical halo formation models. We report here on the
discovery of a hitherto elusive halo of metal-poor Andromeda stars, distinct
from its bulge, with a power-law brightness profile extending beyond r = 160
kiloparsecs. This is 3 - 5 times larger than any previously mapped Andromeda
spheroidal/disk component. Together, the Galactic and Andromeda halos span >1/3
of the distance between them, suggesting that stars occupy a substantial volume
fraction of our Local Group, and possibly most galaxy groups.",2005-02-18T20:55:59Z
"Elemental Abundance Ratios in Stars of the Outer Galactic Disk. I. Open
  Clusters","We summarize radial velocity studies of selected stars in the old, distant
clusters Berkeley 20, Berkeley 21, NGC 2141, Berkeley 29, and Berkeley 31.
Three members of M67 were observed similarly, and those velocities compare
extremely well with prior measures. We measured the chemical compositions of
all six clusters for [Fe/H] as well as abundances of alpha elements, iron-peak
elements, and those synthesized in either the s-process or the r-process.
  For the outer disk, the abundance gradient for [Fe/H] deviates from the trend
defined near the solar neighborhood. Rather than declining with increasing
Galactocentric distance, [Fe/H] appears to reach a ""basement"" at [Fe/H]=-0.5
beyond R_GC = 10 to 12kpc. We find enhanced [O/Fe], [alpha/Fe], and [Eu/Fe] in
the outer disk revealing a rapid star formation history.
  An intriguing, but tentative, conclusion is that the outer disk open cluster
abundance ratios are consistent with the outer disk being formed via a merger
event. The basement in [Fe/H] and enhanced [alpha/Fe] suggest that the outer
disk formed from a reservoir of gas with a star formation history distinct from
the solar neighborhood. The open clusters may have formed as a result of star
formation triggered by a merger event in the outer disk. The ages of the outer
disk open clusters would then be a measure of when the merger occurred.

"Evidence for a long duration component in the prompt emission of short
  Gamma-Ray Bursts detected with BeppoSAX","A statistical study on the light curves of all the short Gamma-Ray Bursts
detected with the Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GRBM) aboard BeppoSAX is reported.
Evidence for a very weak and long duration component associated with these
events in the two 1 s counters of the GRBM (40-700 keV and >100 keV) is found.
It starts a few tens of seconds before the burst and continues for about 30 s
after the burst. The overall hardness of this component is comparable with that
of the event itself. The detection of a signal before the onset time and the
similar hardness are consistent with an interpretation of the long duration
component in terms of prompt emission associated with short GRBs.",2005-04-08T12:36:27Z
Modified Newtonian Dynamics In Dimensionless Form,"Modified Newtonian dynamics proposed that gravitational field needs
modifications when the field strength $g$ is weaker than a critical value
$g_0$. This has been shown to be a good candidate as an alternative to cosmic
dark matter. There is another way to look at this theory as a length scale
dependent theory. One will show that modification of the Newtonian field
strength depends on the mass distribution and the coordinate scale of the
system. It is useful to separate the effective gravitation field $g(r)$ into a
small scale (or short-distance)$g_s$ field and a large scale (or a
long-distance) $g_l$ field that should be helpful for a better understanding of
the underlying physics. The effective potential is also derived.",2005-04-01T15:27:14Z
The application of slim disk models to ULX: the case of M33 X-8,"A comparative XMM-Newton archival data spectral study of the ultraluminous
X-ray source (ULX) M33 X-8 has been performed by using both the standard disk

Astrophysical Observations: Lensing and Eclipsing Einstein's Theories,"Albert Einstein postulated the equivalence of energy and mass, developed the
theory of special relativity, explained the photoelectric effect, and described
Brownian motion in five papers, all published in 1905, 100 years ago. With
these papers, Einstein provided the framework for understanding modern
astrophysical phenomena. Conversely, astrophysical observations provide one of
the most effective means for testing Einstein's theories. Here, I review
astrophysical advances precipitated by Einstein's insights, including
gravitational redshifts, gravitational lensing, gravitational waves, the
Lense-Thirring effect, and modern cosmology. A complete understanding of
cosmology, from the earliest moments to the ultimate fate of the universe, will
require developments in physics beyond Einstein, to a unified theory of gravity
and quantum physics.",2005-03-15T13:11:50Z
Recovering Solar Toroidal Field Dynamics From Sunspot Location Patterns,"We analyze both Kitt Peak magnetogram data and MDI continuum intensity
sunspot data to search for the following solar toroidal band properties: width
in latitude and the existence of a tipping instability (longitudinal m=1 mode)
for any time during the solar cycle. To determine the extent which we can
recover the toroidal field dynamics, we forward model artificially generated
sunspot distributions from subsurface toroidal fields we assigned certain
properties. We analyzed two sunspot distribution parameters using MDI and model
data: the average latitudinal separation of sunspot pairs as a function of
longitudinal separation, and the number of sunspot pairs creating a given angle
with respect to the E-W direction. A toroidal band of 10 degrees width with a
constant tipping of 5 degrees best fits MDI data early in the solar cycle. A
toroidal band of 20 degrees width with a tipping amplitude decreasing in time
from 5 to 0 degrees best fits MDI data late in the solar cycle. Model data
generated by untipped toroidal bands cannot fit MDI high latitude data and can
fit only one parameter at low latitudes. Tipped toroidal bands satisfy chi
squared criteria at both high and low latitudes. We conclude this is evidence
to reject the null hypothesis - that toroidal bands in the solar tachocline do
not experience a tipping instability - in favor of the hypothesis that the
toroidal band experiences an m=1 tipping instability. Our finding that the band
widens from ~10 degrees early in the solar cycle to ~20 degrees late in the
solar cycle may be explained in theory by magnetic drag spreading the toroidal
band due to altered flow along the tipped field lines.",2005-06-01T18:16:18Z
GRB Progenitors and Environment,"The study and knowledge of the environment of Gamma-Ray Bursts is of great
interest from many points of view. For high redshift (z>0.5) events, the
structure of the ambient medium is one of the best indicators of the nature and
properties of the progenitor. It also tells us about the last stages of the
pre-explosion evolution of the progenitor. In addition, it is interesting in
its own as a sample of the interstellar medium in a high redshift galaxy.
Measures of the density and structure of the GRB environment are however
sparse, and different methods yield different, often incompatible, results. I
will review the methods and results with particular emphasis on the case of GRB
021004, a puzzling but highly informative event. I will finally underline the
advancements that will be possible in the Swift era.",2005-05-03T18:36:31Z
"Infrared afterglow of GRB041219 as a result of reradiation on dust in a
  circumstellar cloud","Observations of gamma ray bursts (GRB) afterglows in different spectral bands
provide a most valuable information about their nature, as well as about
properties of surrounding medium. Powerful infrared afterglow was observed from
the strong GRB041219. Here we explain the observed IR afterglow in the model of
a dust reradiation of the main GRB signal in the envelope surrounding the GRB
source. In this model we do not expect appearance of the prompt optical
emission which should be absorbed in the dust envelope. We estimate the
collimation angle of the gamma ray emission, and obtain restrictions on the
redshift (distance to GRB source), by fitting the model parameters to the
observational data.",2005-03-18T15:10:16Z
"Warm-Dense Molecular Gas in the ISM of Starbursts, LIRGs and ULIRGs","The role of star formation in luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies is
a hotly debated issue: while it is clear that starbursts play a large role in
powering the IR luminosity in these galaxies, the relative importance of
possible enshrouded AGNs is unknown. It is therefore important to better
understand the role of star forming gas in contributing to the infrared
luminosity in IR-bright galaxies. The J=3 level of 12CO lies 33K above ground
and has a critical density of ~1.5 X 10^4 cm^-3. The 12CO(J=3-2) line serves as
an effective tracer for warm-dense molecular gas heated by active star
formation. Here we report on 12CO (J=3-2) observations of 17 starburst spirals,
LIRGs and ULIRGs which we obtained with the Heinrich Hertz Submillimeter
Telescope on Mt. Graham, Arizona.
  Our main results are the following: 1. We find a nearly linear relation
between the infrared luminosity and warm-dense molecular gas such that the
infrared luminosity increases as the warm-dense molecular gas to the power
0.92; We interpret this to be roughly consistent with the recent results of Gao
& Solomon (2004a,b). 2. We find L_IR/M_H2 ratios ranging from ~10 to ~128
L_sun/M_sun using a standard CO-H2 conversion factor of 3 X 10^20 cm^-2 (K km
s^-1)^-1. If this conversion factor is ~an order of magnitude less, as
suggested in a recent statistical survey (Yao et al. 2003), then 2-3 of our
objects may have significant contributions to the L_IR by dust-enshrouded AGNs.",2005-04-19T13:32:10Z
Radio synchrotron spectra for a leaky box approximation,"The synchrotron emission observed from many astrophysical objects is commonly
modelled to arise from relativistic electrons in an emission region occupied by
a spatially homogeneous, but tangled magnetic field. However, we know that
magnetic fields embedded in ionised gases tend to form flux ropes interspersed
with regions of much lower magnetic field strengths. Here we develop a full
description of the evolution of the energy distribution of relativistic
electrons in a plasma divided into two distinct regions with different
strengths of the magnetic field. Electrons are able to continuously leak from
the low-field region into the high-field region. The model becomes fully
analytic for physically reasonable assumptions. We show that such a leaky box
model produces two distinct breaks in the electron energy distributions which
give rise to three breaks in the resulting synchrotron spectrum. The spectral
slopes in between the breaks are in general not constant and thus allow for
significant curvature of the spectrum. These spectra are consistent with
spatially resolved observations of the radio spectra of the lobes of radio
galaxies. The exact form of the spectra depends on the adopted diffusion rate.
The leaky box model significantly extends the time over which synchrotron
emission can be detected at a given frequency compared to the usually assumed
case of homogeneous magnetic fields. The spectral ages inferred for the
electron population from standard techniques for the leaky box model are
considerably younger than their real age.",2005-03-17T14:58:48Z
"A multiwavlength study of PSR B0628-28: The first overluminous
  rotation-powered pulsar?","The ROSAT source RX J0630.8-2834 was suggested by positional coincidence to
be the X-ray counterpart of the old field pulsar PSR B0628-28. This
association, however, was regarded to be unlikely based on the computed
energetics of the putative X-ray counterpart. In this paper we report on
multiwavelength observations of PSR B0628-28 made with the ESO/NTT observatory
in La Silla, the Jodrell Bank radio observatory and XMM-Newton. Although the
optical observations do not detect any counterpart of RX J0630.8-2834 down to a
limiting magnitude of V=26.1 mag and B=26.3 mag, XMM-Newton observations
finally confirmed it to be the pulsar's X-ray counterpart by detecting X-ray
pulses with the radio pulsar's spin-period. The X-ray pulse profile is
characterized by a single broad peak with a second smaller peak leading the
main pulse component by ~144 degree. The fraction of pulsed photons is (38 +-
7)% with no strong energy dependence in the XMM-Newton bandpass. The pulsar's
X-ray spectrum is well described by a single component power law with photon
index 2.63^{+0.23}_{-0.15}, indicating that the pulsar's X radiation is
dominated by non-thermal emission processes. A low level contribution of
thermal emission from residual cooling or from heated polar caps, cannot be
excluded. The pulsar's spin-down to X-ray energy conversion efficiency is
obtained to be ~16% for the radio dispersion measure inferred pulsar distance.
If confirmed, PSR B0628-28 would be the first X-ray overluminous
rotation-powered pulsar identified among all ~1400 radio pulsars known today.",2005-05-24T13:45:14Z
"Statistical Mechanics of the self-gravitating gas: thermodynamic limit,
  phase diagrams and fractal structures","We provide a complete picture to the self-gravitating non-relativistic gas at
thermal equilibrium using Monte Carlo simulations, analytic mean field methods
(MF) and low density expansions. The system is shown to possess an infinite
volume limit in the grand canonical (GCE), canonical (CE) and microcanonical
(MCE) ensembles when (N, V) -> infty, keeping N/V^{1/3} fixed. We compute the
equation of state (we do not assume it as is customary in hydrodynamics), as
well as the energy, free energy, entropy, chemical potential, specific heats,
compressibilities and speed of sound; we analyze their properties, signs and
singularities. All physical quantities turn out to depend on a single variable
eta = G m^2 N /[V^{1/3} T} that is kept fixed in the N -> infty and V -> infty
limit. The system is in a gaseous phase for eta < eta_T and collapses into a
dense object for eta > eta_T in the CE with the pressure becoming large and
negative. At eta \simeq eta_T the isothermal compressibility diverges and the
gas collapses. Our Monte Carlo simulations yield eta_T \simeq 1.515. We find
that PV/[NT] = f(eta). The function f(eta) has a second Riemann sheet which is
only physically realized in the MCE. In the MCE, the collapse phase transition
takes place in this second sheet near eta_{MC} = 1.26 and the pressure and
temperature are larger in the collapsed phase than in the gaseous phase. Both
collapse phase transitions (in the CE and in the MCE) are of zeroth order since
the Gibbs free energy has a jump at the transitions.",2005-05-27T17:01:22Z
A Separate Universe Approach to Quintessence Perturbations,"There is some observational evidence that the dark energy may not be smooth
on large scales. This makes it worth while to try and get as simple and as
intuitive a picture of how dark energy perturbations behave so as to be able to
better constrain possible models of dark energy and the generation of large
scale perturbations. The separate Universe method provides an easy way to
evaluate cosmological perturbations, as all that is required is an
understanding of the background behavior. Here, this method is used to show how
the size of the dark energy perturbations, preferred by observations, is larger
than would be expected, and so some mechanism may be required to amplify them.",2005-03-30T23:28:16Z
The Prevalence of Cooling Cores in Clusters of Galaxies at z~0.15-0.4,"We present a Chandra study of 38 X-ray luminous clusters of galaxies in the
ROSAT Brightest Cluster Sample (BCS) that lie at z~0.15-0.4. We find that the
majority of clusters at moderate redshift generally have smooth, relaxed
morphologies with some evidence for mild substructure perhaps indicative of
recent minor merger activity. Using spatially-resolved spectral analyses, cool
cores appear to still be common at these redshifts. At a radius of 50 kpc, we
find that at least 55 per cent of the clusters in our sample exhibit signs of
mild cooling [t(cool)<10 Gyr], while in the central bin at least 34 per cent
demonstrate signs of strong cooling [t(cool)<2 Gyr]. These percentages are
nearly identical to those found for luminous, low-redshift clusters of
galaxies, suggesting little evolution in cluster cores since z~0.4 and that
heating and cooling mechanisms may already have stabilised by this epoch.
Comparing the central cooling times to central Halpha emission in BCS clusters,
we find a strong correspondence between the detection of Halpha and central
cooling time. (Abridged)",2005-03-10T02:30:47Z
Simultaneous Multi-Wavelength Observations of Sgr A*,"We observed Sgr A* using the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Giant Metrewave
Radio Telescope (GMRT) at multiple cm and mm wavelengths on 17 June 2003. The
measured flux densities of Sgr A*, together with those obtained from the
Submillimeter Array (SMA) and the Keck II 10 m telescope on the same date, are
used to construct a simultaneous spectrum of Sgr A* from 90 cm to 3.8 $\mu$m.
The simultaneous spectrum shows a spectral break at about 3.6 cm, a possible
signature of synchrotron self-absorption of the strong radio outburst which
occurred near epoch 17 July 2003. At 90 cm, the flux density of Sgr A* is
$0.22\pm0.06$ Jy, suggesting a sharp decrease in flux density at wavelengths
longer than 47 cm. The spectrum at long cm wavelengths appears to be consistent
with free-free absorption by a screen of ionized gas with a cutoff $\sim$100
cm. This cutoff wavelength appears to be three times longer than that of
$\sim$30 cm suggested by Davies, Walsh & Booth based on observations in 1974
and 1975. Our analysis suggests that the flux densities of Sgr A* at
wavelengths longer than 30 cm could be attenuated and modulated by stellar
winds from massive stars close to Sgr A*.",2005-03-24T08:55:25Z
Intergalactic HI Clouds,"Neutral intergalactic clouds are so greatly out numbered by galaxies that
their integral HI content is negligible in comparison to that contained in
optically luminous galaxies. In fact, no HI cloud that is not associated with a
galaxy or grouping of galaxies has yet been identified. This points to a causal
relationship that relies on gravitational potentials that bind galaxies also
being responsible for confining HI clouds to sufficient density that they can
become self-shielding to the ionizing background radiation. Unconfined clouds
of low density become ionized, but confined clouds find themselves vulnerable
to instability and collapse, leading to star formation.",2005-02-16T02:06:01Z
A quasi-time-dependent radiative transfer model of OH104.9+2.4,"We investigate the pulsation-phase dependent properties of the circumstellar
dust shell (CDS) of the OH/IR star OH104.9+2.4 based on radiative transfer
modeling (RTM) using the code DUSTY. Our previous study concerning simultaneous
modeling of the spectral energy distribution (SED) and near-infrared (NIR)
visibilities (Riechers et al. 2004) has now been extended by means of a more
detailed analysis of the pulsation-phase dependence of the model parameters of
OH104.9+2.4. In order to investigate the temporal variation in the spatial
structure of the CDS, additional NIR speckle interferometric observations in
the K' band were carried out with the 6 m telescope of the Special
Astrophysical Observatory (SAO). At a wavelength of 2.12 micron the
diffraction-limited resolution of 74 mas was attained. Several key parameters
of our previous best-fitting model had to be adjusted in order to be consistent
with the newly extended amount of observational data. It was found that a
simple rescaling of the bolometric flux F_bol is not sufficient to take the
variability of the source into account, as the change in optical depth over a
full pulsation cycle is rather high. On the other hand, the impact of a change
in effective temperature T_eff on SED and visibility is rather small. However,
observations, as well as models for other AGB stars, show the necessity of
including a variation of T_eff with pulsation phase in the radiative transfer
models. Therefore, our new best-fitting model accounts for these changes.",2005-02-14T18:14:46Z
"Spatial dependence of 2MASS luminosity and mass functions in the old
  open cluster NGC 188","Luminosity and mass functions in the old open cluster NGC 188 are analysed by
means of J and H 2MASS photometry. Within the uncertainties, the observed
projected radial density profile of NGC 188 departs from the two-parameter King
model in two inner regions, which reflects the non-virialized dynamical state
and possibly, some degree of non-sphericity in the spatial shape of this old
open cluster. Fits with two and three-parameter King models to the radial
distribution of stars resulted in a core radius of 1.3 pc and a tidal radius of
21 pc. The present 2MASS analysis resulted in significant slope variations with
distance in the mass function $\phi(m)\propto m^{-(1+\chi)}$, being flat in the
central parts ($\chi=0.6\pm0.7$) and steep in the cluster outskirts
($\chi=7.2\pm0.6$). The overall mass function has a slope $\chi=1.9\pm0.7$,
slightly steeper than a standard Salpeter mass function. Solar metallicity
Padova isochrone fits to the near-infrared colour-magnitude diagram of NGC 188
resulted in an age of $7.0\pm1.0$ Gyr. The best fit, obtained with the 7.1 Gyr
isochrone, produced a distance modulus $\mM=11.1\pm0.1$, $\ebv=0.0$, and a
distance to the Sun $\ds=1.66\pm0.08$ kpc. The observed stellar mass (in the
range $0.98 \ms - 1.08 \ms$) in NGC 188 is $\mobs=380\pm12 \ms$. A simple
extrapolation of the observed overall mass function to stars with $0.08 \ms$
resulted in a total present mass of $\mtot\sim(1.8\pm0.7)\times10^4 \ms$. On
the other hand, for a more realistic initial mass function which flattens in
the low-mass range, the total mass in NGC 188 drops to
$\mtot\sim(3.8\pm1.6)\times10^3 \ms$.",2005-02-22T12:21:23Z
X-rays from accretion shocks in T Tauri stars: The case of BP Tau,"We present an XMM-Newton observation of the classical T Tauri star BP Tau. In
the XMM-Newton RGS spectrum the O {\sc vii} triplet is clearly detected with a
very weak forbidden line indicating high plasma densities and/or a high UV flux
environment. At the same time concurrent UV data point to a small hot spot
filling factor suggesting an accretion funnel shock as the site of the X-ray
and UV emission. Together with the X-ray data on TW Hya these new observations
suggest such funnels to be a general feature in classical T Tauri stars.",2005-03-07T13:45:33Z
"Optimal Choice of the Softening Length and Time-Step in N-body
  Simulations","A criterion for the choice of optimal softening length $\epsilon$ and
time-step $dt$ for $N$-body simulations of a collisionless stellar system is
analyzed. Plummer and Hernquist spheres are used as models to follow how
changes in various parameters of an initially equilibrium stable model depend
on $\epsilon$ and $dt$. These dependences are used to derive a criterion for
choosing $\epsilon$ and $dt$. The resulting criterion is compared to Merritt's
criterion for choosing the softening length, which is based on minimizing the
mean irregular force acting on a particle with unit mass. Our criterion for
choosing $\epsilon$ and $dt$ indicate that $\epsilon$ must be a factor of 1.5-2
smaller than the mean distance between particles in the densest regions to be
resolved. The time-step must always be adjusted to the chosen $\epsilon$ (the
particle must, on average, travel a distance smaller than $0.5\epsilon$ during
one time-step). An algorithm for solving N-body problems with adaptive
variations of the softening length is discussed in connection with the task of
choosing $\epsilon$, but is found not to be promising.",2005-04-26T11:36:58Z
"Star formation in unbound giant molecular clouds: the origin of OB
  associations?","We investigate the formation of star clusters in an unbound GMC, where the
supporting kinetic energy is twice as large as the cloud's self-gravity. This
cloud manages to form a series of star clusters and disperse, all within
roughly 2 crossing times (10 Myr), supporting recent claims that star formation
is a rapid process. Simple assumptions about the nature of the star formation
occurring in the clusters allows us to place an estimate for the star formation
efficiency at about 5 to 10 %, consistent with observations. We also propose
that unbound clouds can act as a mechanism for forming OB associations. The
clusters that form in the cloud behave as OB subgroups. These clusters are
naturally expanding from one another due to unbound nature of the flows that
create them. The properties of the cloud we present here are are consistent
with those of classic OB associations.",2005-03-07T12:29:54Z
The Modelling of InfraRed Dark Clouds,"This paper presents results from modelling 450 micron and 850 micron
continuum and HCO+ line observations of three distinct cores of an infrared
dark cloud (IRDC) directed toward the W51 GMC. In the sub-mm continuum these
cores appear as bright, isolated emission features. One of them coincides with
the peak of 8.3 micron extinction as measured by the Midcourse Space Experiment
satellite. Detailed radiative transfer codes are applied to constrain the
cores' physical conditions to address the key question: Do these IRDC-cores
harbour luminous sources? The results of the continuum model, expressed in the
$\chi^2$ quality-of-fit parameter, are also constrained by the absence of 100
micron emission from IRAS. For the sub-mm emission peaks this shows that
sources of 300 solar luminosities are embedded within the cores. For the
extinction peak, the combination of continuum and HCO+ line modelling indicates
that a heating source is present as well. Furthermore, the line model provides
constraints on the clumpiness of the medium. All three cores have similar
masses of about 70-150 solar masses and similar density structures. The
extinction peak differs from the other two cores by hosting a much weaker
heating source, and the sub-mm emission core at the edge of the IRDC deviates
from the other cores by a higher internal clumpiness.",2005-05-19T13:33:03Z
"C,N,O in lambda Boo stars and in composite spectra","The selective abundance of C, N, O (almost solar) with respect to that of
other elements (underabundant) in lambda Boo stars has been interpreted as a
characteristic peculiarity of these objects, when considered as single stars.
We show here that a similar selective abundance is predicted from the composite
spectra resulting from two unresolved stars in the same temperature range as
the lambda Boo stars.",2005-04-05T10:05:47Z
Statistics of Quasars Multiply Imaged by Galaxy Clusters,"We compute the expected number of quasars multiply imaged by cluster size
dark halos for current wide field quasar surveys by carrying out a large
ensemble of ray tracing simulations through clusters from a cosmological N-body
simulation of the LCDM cosmology. Our calculation predicts ~ 4 quasar lenses
with splittings theta > 10"" in the SDSS spectroscopic quasar sample, consistent
with the recent discovery of the wide separation lens SDSSJ1004+4112 which has
theta=14.6"". The SDSS faint photometric quasar survey will contain ~12 multiply
imaged quasars with splittings theta > 10"". Of these, ~ 2 will be lenses with

Differential rotation on the lower main sequence,"We compute the differential rotation of main sequence stars of the spectral
types F, G, K, and M by solving the equation of motion and the equation of
convective heat transport in a mean-field formulation. For each spectral type
the rotation rate is varied to study the dependence of the surface shear on
this parameter. The resulting rotation patterns are all solar-type. The
horizontal shear turns out to depend strongly on the effective temperature and
only weakly on the rotation rate. The meridional flow depends more strongly on
the rotation rate and has different directions in the cases of very slow and
very fast rotation, respectively.",2005-04-19T13:10:22Z
"The metal abundance distribution of the oldest stellar component in the
  Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy","(abridged): Low resolution spectroscopy obtained with FORS2 at the Very Large
Telescope (VLT) has been used to measure individual metal abundances ([Fe/H])
for 107 RR Lyrae stars, and trace the metal distribution of the oldest stellar
component in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Their metallicities have an
average value of [Fe/H]=-1.83 +/- 0.03 (r.m.s. 0.26 dex) and cover the
metallicity range -2.40<[Fe/H]<-0.85 (only 1 star with [Fe/H]>-1). The
star-to-star scatter is larger than typical errors on individual metallicities
(+/- 0.15-0.16 dex), indicating a real spread in metal abundances. The radial
velocities have a dispersion of 12.9 km/s, consistent with the dispersion
derived in Sculptor by Tolstoy et al. (2004). This along with the metallicity
distribution, suggests that most of the RR Lyr's arise from the same burst of
stellar formation that produced the metal-poor component giving origin to the
galaxy blue horizontal branch, and only a few (if any) come from the centrally
concentrated metal-rich red horizontal branch population. The spectroscopic
metallicities and the apparent luminosities were used to study the
luminosity-metallicity relation, for which we derive a shallow slope of 0.09
mag/dex. This result can be due to a high level of evolution off the zero age
horizontal branch of the RR Lyrae stars in this galaxy, again in agreement with
their origin from the blue horizontal branch population.",2005-06-09T14:15:22Z
GRB-supernovae: a new spin on gravitational waves,"The discovery of the GRB-supernova association poses the question on the
nature of the inner engine as the outcome of Type Ib/c supernovae. These events
are believed to represent core-collapse of massive stars, probably in
low-period stellar binaries and similar but not identical to the Type II event
SN1987A. The branching ratio of Type Ib/c supernovae into GRB-supernovae has
the remarkably small value of less than 0.5%. These observational constraints
point towards a rapidly rotating black hole formed at low probability with low
kick velocity. The putative black hole hereby remains centered, and matures
into a high-mass object with large rotational energy in angular momentum. As
the MeV-neutrino emissions from SN1987A demonstrate, the most powerful probe of
the inner workings of core-collapse events are radiation channels to which the
remnant envelope is optically thin. We here discuss the prospect of
gravitational-wave emissions powered by a rapidly rotating central black hole
which, in contrast to MeV-neutrinos, can be probed to distances as large as
100Mpc through upcoming gravitational-wave detectors LIGO and Virgo. We
identify the GRB-emissions, commonly attributed to ultrarelativistic
baryon-poor ejecta, with a new process of linear acceleration of charged
particles along the axis of rotation of a black hole in response to spin-orbit
coupling. We include some preliminary numerical simulations on internal shocks
produced by intermittent ejecta. The results showing a radial splash, which
points towards low-luminosity and lower-energy radiation at large angles,
possibly related to X-ray flashes.",2005-06-09T00:29:10Z
Ice Age Epochs and the Sun's Path Through the Galaxy,"We present a calculation of the Sun's motion through the Milky Way Galaxy
over the last 500 million years. The integration is based upon estimates of the
Sun's current position and speed from measurements with Hipparcos and upon a
realistic model for the Galactic gravitational potential. We estimate the times
of the Sun's past spiral arm crossings for a range in assumed values of the
spiral pattern angular speed. We find that for a difference between the mean
solar and pattern speed of Omega_Sun - Omega_p = 11.9 +/- 0.7 km/s/kpc the Sun
has traversed four spiral arms at times that appear to correspond well with
long duration cold periods on Earth. This supports the idea that extended
exposure to the higher cosmic ray flux associated with spiral arms can lead to
increased cloud cover and long ice age epochs on Earth.",2005-03-14T23:21:24Z
Abundances in Damped Ly-alpha Galaxies,"Damped Ly_alpha galaxies provide a sample of young galaxies where chemical
abundances can be derived throughout the whole universe with an accuracy
comparable to that for the local universe. Despite a large spread in redshift,
HI column density and metallicity, DLA galaxies show a remarkable uniformity in
the elemental ratios rather suggestive of similar chemical evolution if not of
an unique population. These galaxies are characterized by a moderate, if any,
enhancement of alpha-elements over Fe-peak elemental abundance with [S/Zn]
about 0 and [O/Zn] about 0.2, rather similarly to the dwarfs galaxies in the
Local Group. Nitrogen shows a peculiar behaviour with a bimodal distribution
and possibly two plateaux. In particular, the plateau at low N abundances
([N/H] < -3), is not observed in other atrophysical sites and might be evidence
for primary N production by massive stars.",2005-03-09T13:43:52Z
Fourier Phase Analysis of SDSS Galaxies,"We present a first analysis of the clustering of SDSS galaxies using the
distribution function of the sum of Fourier phases. This statistic was recently
proposed by one of authors as a new method to probe phase correlations of
cosmological density fields. Since the Fourier phases are statistically
independent of Fourier amplitudes, the phase statistic plays a complementary
role to the conventional two-point statistics of galaxy clustering. In
particular, we focus on the distribution functions of phase sum over three
closed wavevectors as a function of the configurations of triangle wavevectors.
We find that the observed distribution functions of phase sum are in good
agreement with the lowest-order approximation from perturbation theory. For
direct comparison with observations, we construct mock catalogs from N-body
simulations taking account of several observational effects such as the survey
geometry, the redshift distortion, and the discreteness due to the limited
number of data. Indeed the observed phase correlations for the galaxies in the
range of absolute magnitude -22<Mr<-18 agree well with those for Lambda CDM
predictions with sigma8=0.9 evolved from Gaussian initial condition. This
agreement implies that the galaxy biasing is approximately linear in redshift
space. Instead, assuming that the galaxy biasing is described by a quadratic
deterministic function at scale larger than 30Mpc/h, we can constrain the ratio
of the quadratic biasing parameter b2 to the linear biasing parameter b1. We
find that resulting b2/b1 is mainly dependent on sigma8 and that it is well
fitted by b2/b1=0.54(+-0.06)-0.62(+-0.08)sigma8 in CDM models. Indeed, b2/b1 is
nearly zero when sigma8=0.9.",2005-06-09T09:18:41Z
Resolving the mystery of the dwarf galaxy HIZSS003,"The nearby galaxy HIZSS003 was recently discovered during a blind HI survey
of the zone of avoidance (Henning et al. 2000). Follow up VLA as well as
optical and near-IR imaging and spectroscopy (Massey et al. 2003; Silva et al.
2005) confirm that it is a low metallicity dwarf irregular galaxy. However
there were two puzzling aspects of the observations, (i) current star
formation, as traced by H$\alpha$ emission, is confined to a small region at
the edge of the VLA HI image and (ii) the metallicity of the older RGB stars is
higher than that of the gas in HII region. We present high spatial and velocity
resolution Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) observations that resolve
these puzzles by showing that HIZSS003 is actually a galaxy pair and that the
HII region lies at the center of a much smaller companion galaxy (HIZSS003B) to
the main galaxy (HIZSS003A). The HI emission from these two galaxies overlaps
in projection, but can be separated in velocity space. HIZSS003B has an HI mass
of 2.6 X 10^6 M$_\odot$, and a highly disturbed velocity field. Since the
velocity field is disturbed, an accurate rotation curve cannot be derived,
however, the indicative dynamical mass is ~5 X 10^7 M$_\odot$. For the bigger
galaxy HIZSS003A we derive an HI mass of 1.4 X 10^7 M$_\odot$. The velocity
field of this galaxy is quite regular and from its rotation curve we derive a
total dynamical mass of ~6.5 X 10^8 M$_\odot$.",2005-03-06T05:28:28Z
Power Spectra in V-band and Halpha of Nine Irregular Galaxies,"Fourier transform power spectra of major axis cuts in V and Halpha images
were made for a sample of 9 irregular galaxies. These power spectra reveal
structure over a wide range of scales. For 6 of the galaxies the power spectrum
slopes at intermediate scales (1-400 pc) in the V-band images range from -1.3
to -1.5. The similarity of slopes suggests that the same processes are
structuring these systems. These slopes are slightly shallower than what is
observed in other galaxies in HI, molecular emission, dust extinction, and
optical light. Three of the galaxies have flat power spectra like noise from
the sky; these three galaxies are relatively indistinct in the direct images.
The power spectrum slope for Halpha steepens with increasing star formation
rate, ranging from a shallow value comparable to the noise at low rates to a
steep value with a slope of -1.5 at high rates. This change reflects the
increasing areal filling factor of Halpha emission with increasing star
formation rate, and an apparently universal slope inside the Halpha regions
that is comparable to that for Kolmogorov turbulence. The power spectrum of HI
in one galaxy has a steeper power law, with a slope of -2.9. The fact that the
power laws of star formation are about the same for dwarf galaxies and giant
spiral galaxies suggests the microscopic processes are the same, independent of
spiral density waves and galaxy size.",2005-03-14T20:33:48Z
"Spatial and Temporal Variations in Small-Scale Galactic HI Structure
  Toward 3C~138","We present three epochs of VLBA observations of Galactic HI absorption toward
the quasar 3C~138 with resolutions of 20 mas (~ 10 AU). This analysis includes
VLBA data from observations in 1999 and 2002 along with a reexamination of 1995
VLBA data. Improved data reduction and imaging techniques have led to an order
of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared to previous work. With these
new data we confirm the previously detected milliarcsecond scale spatial
variations in the HI opacity at the level of Delta(tau_{max}) =0.50 \pm 0.05.
The typical size scale of the optical depth variations is ~ 50 mas or 25 AU. In
addition, for the first time we see clear evidence for temporal variations in
the HI opacity over the seven year time span of our three epochs of data. We
also attempted to detect the magnetic field strength in the HI gas using the
Zeeman effect. From this analysis we have been able to place a 3 sigma upper
limit on the magnetic field strength per pixel of ~45 muG. We have also been
able to calculate for the first time the plane of sky covering fraction of the
small scale HI gas of ~10%. We also find that the line widths of the
milliarcsecond sizescale HI features are comparable to those determined from
previous single dish measurements toward 3C~138, suggesting that the opacity
variations cannot be due to changes in the HI spin temperature. From these
results we favor a density enhancement interpretation for the small scale HI
structures, although these enhancements appear to be of short duration and are
unlikely to be in equilibrium.",2005-05-04T18:19:07Z
"Variability of Broad and Blueshifted Component of [OIII]$λ$5007 in
  IZWI","Although the existence of asymmetrical profile of [OIII]$\lambda$5007 has
been discovered for ages, its filiation and physics are poorly understood. Two
new spectra of I ZWI taken on Nov 16, 2001 and on Dec 3, 2002 were compared
with the spectra taken by BG92. Following results are obtained. 1)The certain
variations of broad [OIII] during about 10 years separating the observations
are identified. The inferred length scale of broad [OIII] emitting region
ranges from 0.3pc to 3pc. By assuming a Keplerian motion in emitting region,
the material emitting broad [OIII] is likely to be located at transient
emission line region, between BLR and NLR. 2)We find a positive relation
between the FeII emission and flux of H$\beta$(or continuum). On the other
hand, the parameter RFe decreases with ionizing continuum marginally. 3)We
detect a low ionized NLR in I ZWI, because of the low flux ratios
$\rm{[OIII]_{n}/H\beta_{n}}$($\sim1.7$).",2005-04-04T18:31:57Z
"The Araucaria Project. Near-Infrared Photometry of Cepheid Variables in
  the Sculptor Galaxy NGC 300","We have obtained deep near-infrared images in J and K filters of three fields
in the Sculptor galaxy NGC 300 with the ESO VLT and ISAAC camera. For 16
Cepheid variables in these fields, we have determined J and K magnitudes at two
different epochs, and have derived their mean magnitudes in these bands. The
slopes of the resulting period-luminosity relations are in very good agreement
with the slopes of these relations measured in the LMC by Persson et al.
Fitting the LMC slopes to our data, we have derived distance moduli in J and K.
Using these values together with the values derived in the optical V and I
bands in our previous work, we have determined an improved total reddening for
NGC 300 of E(B-V)=0.096 +/- 0.006 mag, which yields extremely consistent values
for the absorption-corrected distance modulus of the galaxy from VIJK bands.
Our distance result for NGC 300 from this combined optical/near infrared
Cepheid study is (m-M)_0 = 26.37 +/- 0.04 (random) +/- 0.03 (systematic) mag
and is tied to an adopted true LMC distance modulus of 18.50 mag. Both random
and systematic uncertainties are dominated by photometric errors, while errors
due to reddening, metallicity effects and crowding are less important. Our
distance determination is consistent with the earlier result from near-infrared
(H-band) photometry of two Cepheids in NGC 300 by Madore et al., but far more
accurate. Our distance value also agrees with the HST Key Project result of
Freedman et al., and with the recent distance estimate for NGC 300 from Butler
et al. from the TRGB I-band magnitude when our improved reddening is used to
calculate the absorption corrections. Our distance results from the different
optical and near-infrared bands indicate that the reddening law in NGC 300 must
be very similar to the Galactic one.",2005-03-29T19:35:45Z
"Dark energy, chaotic fields, and fundamental constants","To explain the currently observed accelerated expansion of the universe, a
large number of different theoretical models are presently being discussed. In
one way or another, all of these contain `new physics', though at different
levels. The big question is how to select out of infinitely many possible
models the right one. Here we discuss a possibility that has so far been
somewhat neglected, namely that the new physics underlying dark energy arises
out of a gravitationally active amendment of the electroweak and strong sector
of the standard model. This amendment basically consists of a rapidly
fluctuating gravitationally active dynamics of vacuum fluctuations with a
cutoff of the order of the neutrino mass scale. We consider a concrete model
for this based on second-quantized self-interacting scalar fields, which evolve
in a chaotic way. It is shown that expectations with respect to the chaotic
dynamics yield statements on the observed numerical values of the electroweak
coupling constants with amazing precision, thus providing evidence for the
physical relevance of this model.",2005-02-10T10:32:54Z
The Dynamics of the Magnetoviscous Instability,"In dilute astrophysical plasmas, the collisional mean free path of a particle
can exceed its Larmor radius. Under these conditions, the thermal conductivity
and viscosity of the plasma can be dramatically altered. This alteration allows
outwardly decreasing angular velocity or temperature gradients to become
strongly destabilizing. This paper generalizes an earlier, simple analysis of
the viscosity instability, by including the dynamical effects of magnetic field
line tension. Such effects lower the growth rates found in the absence of such
tension, but still allow growth rates in excess of the maximum of the standard
magnetorotational instability. We find very good quantitative agreement with
more complex kinetic treatments of the same process. The combination of large
growth rates and large magnetic Prandtl number suggest that protogalactic disks
are powerful dynamos.",2005-04-29T16:24:14Z
"Helium Recombination Lines as a Probe of Abundance and Temperature
  Problems","The paper presents a simplified formula to determine an electron temperature,
Te(He I), for planetary nebulae (PNe) using the He I 7281/6678 line flux ratio.
In our previous studies of Te(He I) (Zhang et al. 2005), we used the He I line
emission coefficients given by Benjamin et al. (1999). Here we examine the
results of using more recent atomic data presented by Porter et al. (2005). A
good agreement is shown, suggesting that the effect of uncertainties of atomic
data on the resultant Te(He I) is negligible. We also present an analytical
formula to derive electron temperature using the He I discontinuity at 3421 A.
Our analysis shows that Te(He I) values are significantly lower than electron
temperatures deduced from the Balmer jump of H I recombination spectra, Te(H
I), and that inferred from the collisionally excited [O III] nebular-to-auroral
forbidden line flux ratio, Te([O III]). In addition, Te(H I) covers a wider
range of values than either Te(He I) or Te([O III]). This supports the
two-abundance nebular model with hydrogen-deficient material embedded in
diffuse gas of a ``normal'' chemical composition (i.e. ~solar).",2005-06-14T14:24:30Z
High mass X-ray binaries in the SMC: the luminosity function,"We study population of compact X-ray sources in the Small Magellanic Cloud
using the archival data of XMM-Newton observatory. The total area of the survey
is ~1.5 square degrees with the limiting sensitivity of ~10^{-14} erg/s/cm^2,
corresponding to the luminosity of ~4.3\cdot 10^{33} erg/s at the SMC distance.
Out of ~150 point sources detected in the 2--8 keV energy band, ~3/4 are
background CXB sources, observed through the SMC. Based on the properties of
the optical and near-infrared counterparts of the detected sources we
identified likely HMXB candidates, and sources, whose nature is uncertain,
thus, providing a lower and upper limits on the luminosity distribution of
HMXBs in the observed part of the SMC.
  The observed number of HMXBs is consistent with the prediction based on SFR
estimates derived from the supernovae frequency and analysis of color-magnitude
diagrams of the stellar population. If, on the contrary, the true value of the
SFR is better represented by FIR, H_alpha and UV based estimators, then the
abundance of HMXBs in the SMC may significantly (by a factor of as much as ~10)
exceed the value derived for the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies.
  The shape of the observed distribution at the bright end is consistent with
the universal HMXB XLF. At the faint end, L_X>2* 10^{34} erg/sec, the upper
limit on the luminosity function is consistent with while the lower limit is
significantly flatter than the L^{-0.6} power law.",2005-03-22T15:49:40Z
"An Artificial Neural Network Approach to the Solution of Molecular
  Chemical Equilibrium","A novel approach is presented for the solution of instantaneous chemical
equilibrium problems. The chemical equilibrium can be considered, due to its
intrinsically local character, as a mapping of the three-dimensional parameter
space spanned by the temperature, hydrogen density and electron density into
many one-dimensional spaces representing the number density of each species. We
take advantage of the ability of artificial neural networks to approximate
non-linear functions and construct neural networks for the fast and efficient
solution of the chemical equilibrium problem in typical stellar atmosphere
physical conditions. The neural network approach has the advantage of providing
an analytic function, which can be rapidly evaluated. The networks are trained
with a learning set (that covers the entire parameter space) until a relative
error below 1% is reached. It has been verified that the networks are not
overtrained by using an additional verification set. The networks are then
applied to a snapshot of realistic three-dimensional convection simulations of
the solar atmosphere showing good generalization properties.",2005-05-16T15:59:14Z
"A boxy bulge in the Milky Way. Inversion of the stellar statistics
  equation with 2MASS data","Inverting the stellar statistics equation from 2MASS star counts, we obtain
the 3D density distribution of the Galactic bulge as well as its luminosity
function in the K-band. This results in a boxy bulge with axial ratios
1:0.5:0.4 and a major axis angle with respect to the Sun-galactic center of
$20^\circ-35^\circ $.",2005-04-27T17:47:58Z
What we do and do not know about the s-process,"AGB stars are the source for the main component of the $s$-process. Here we
discuss both the properties which are reasonably well known and those which
still suffer from substantial uncertainties. In the former case, we are fairly
sure that the $s$-process contribution from AGB stars comes from masses between
about 1 and 3 $\msun$, and the dominant neutron source is the
$^{13}$C$(\alpha$,n)$^{16}$O reaction. In the latter category remains the
formation mechanism for the $^{13}$C-pocket. Attempts at including rotation
seem to inhibit neutron capture reactions. Explaining the observations seems to
require a spread in the size of the $^{13}$C-pocket so some stochastic process,
such as rotation, must be involved.",2005-05-19T23:41:16Z
"Dust Growth and Settling in Protoplanetary Disks and Disk Spectral
  Energy Distributions. I. Laminar Disks","Dust growth and settling considerably affect the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of protoplanetary disks. We investigated dust growth and
settling in protoplanetary disks through numerical simulations to examine
time-evolution of the disk optical thickness and SEDs. In the present paper, we
considered laminar disks as a first step of a series of papers. As a result of
dust growth and settling, a dust layer forms around the mid-plane of a gaseous
disk. After the formation of the dust layer, small dust grains remain floating
above the layer. Although the surface density of the floating small grains is
much less than that of the dust layer, they govern the disk optical thickness
and the emission. The floating small grains settle onto the dust layer in a
long time scale compared with the formation of the dust layer. Rapid grain
growth in the inner part of disks makes the radial distribution of the disk
optical thickness less steep than that of the disk surface density. At t >
10^6yr, the optical thickness of the inner disk (> a few AU) almost vanishes,
which may correspond to disk inner holes observed by Spitzer Space Telescope.
Furthermore, we examined time-evolution of disk SEDs, using our numerical
results and the two-layer model. The grain growth and settling decrease the
magnitude of the SEDs especially. Our results indicate that grain growth and
settling can explain the decrease in observed energy fluxes at
millimeter/sub-millimeter wavelengths with time scales of 10^{6-7}yr without
depletion of the disks.",2005-02-15T10:12:23Z
"The Origin of Massive O-type Field Stars. Part II: Field O stars as
  runaways","In two papers we try to confirm that all Galactic high-mass stars are formed
in a cluster environment, by excluding that O-type stars found in the Galactic
field actually formed there. In de Wit et al. (2004) we presented deep K-band
imaging of 5 arcmin fields centred on 43 massive O-type field stars that
revealed that the large majority of these objects are single objects. In this
contribution we explore the possibility that the field O stars are dynamically
ejected from young clusters, by investigating their peculiar space velocity
distribution, their distance from the Galactic plane, and their spatial
vicinity to known young stellar clusters. We (re-)identify 22 field O-type
stars as candidate runaway OB-stars. The statistics show that ~4% of all O-type
stars with V < 8 can be considered as formed outside a cluster environment.
Most are spectroscopically single objects, some are visual binaries. The
derived percentage for O-type stars that form isolated in the field based on
our statistical analyses is in agreement with what is expected from
calculations adopting a universal cluster richness distribution with power
index of beta = 1.7, assuming that the cluster richness distribution is
continuous down to the smallest clusters containing one single star.",2005-03-16T09:01:19Z
X-ray Light Curves and Accretion Disk Structure of EX Hydrae,"We present X-ray light curves for the cataclysmic variable EX Hydrae obtained
with the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer and the Extreme
Ultraviolet Explorer Deep Survey photometer. We confirm earlier results on the
shape and amplitude of the binary light curve and discuss a new feature: the
phase of the minimum in the binary light curve, associated with absorption by
the bulge on the accretion disk, increases with wavelength. We discuss several
scenarios that could account for this trend and conclude that, most likely, the
ionization state of the bulge gas is not constant, but rather decreases with
binary phase. We also conclude that photoionization of the bulge by radiation
originating from the white dwarf is not the main source of ionization, but that
it is heated by shocks originating from the interaction between the inflowing
material from the companion and the accretion disk. The findings in this paper
provide a strong test for accretion disk models in close binary systems.",2005-04-19T14:08:41Z
"Chandra Observation of the Cluster of Galaxies MS 0839.9+2938 at
  z=0.194: the Central Excess Iron and SN Ia Enrichment","We present the Chandra study of the intermediately distant cluster of
galaxies MS 0839.9+2938. By performing both the projected and deprojected
spectral analyses, we find that the gas temperature is approximately constant
at about 4 keV in 130-444h_70^-1 kpc. In the inner regions, the gas temperature
descends towards the center, reaching <~ 3 keV in the central 37h_70^-1 kpc.
This infers that the lower and upper limits of the mass deposit rate are 9-34
M_sun yr^-1 and 96-126 M_sun yr^-1, respectively within 74h_70^-1 kpc where the
gas is significantly colder. Along with the temperature drop, we detect a
significant inward iron abundance increase from about 0.4 solar in the outer
regions to about 1 solar within the central 37h_70^-1 kpc. Thus MS 0839.9+2938
is the cluster showing the most significant central iron excess at z>~ 0.2. We
argue that most of the excess iron should have been contributed by SNe Ia. By
utilizing the observed SN Ia rate and stellar mass loss rate, we estimate that
the time needed to enrich the central region with excess iron is 6.4-7.9 Gyr,
which is similar to those found for the nearby clusters. Coinciding with the
optical extension of the cD galaxy (up to about 30h_70^-1 kpc), the observed
X-ray surface brightness profile exhibits an excess beyond the distribution
expected by either the beta model or the NFW model, and can be well fitted with
an empirical two-beta model that leads to a relatively flatter mass profile in
the innermost region.",2005-06-12T10:16:34Z
Spectral Indications of Density Variability in the Corona of AD Leonis,"Direct comparison of high-resolution X-ray spectra of the active dMe star AD
Leo, observed three times with Chandra, shows variability of key
density-sensitive lines, possibly due to flaring activity. In particular, a
significant long-duration enhancement of the coronal density is indicated by
the Ne IX and Si XIII He-like triplets, and possibly also by density-sensitive
Fe XXI line ratios.",2005-02-18T17:51:52Z
Westerbork HI observations of high-velocity clouds near M31 and M33,"We have undertaken high-resolution follow-up of a sample of high velocity HI
clouds apparently associated with M31. Our sample was chosen from the
population of high-velocity clouds (HVCs) detected out to 50 kpc projected
radius of the Andromeda Galaxy by Thilker et al. (2004) with the Green Bank
Telescope. Nine pointings were observed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio
Telescope to determine the physical parameters of these objects and to find
clues to their origin. One additional pointing was directed at a similar object
near M33. At 2' resolution we detect 16 individual HVCs around M31 and 1 HVC
near M33 with typical HI masses of a few times 10^5 solar masses and sizes of
the order of 1 kpc. Estimates of the dynamical and virial masses of some of the
HVCs indicate that they are likely gravitationally dominated by additional mass
components such as dark matter or ionised gas. Twelve of the clouds are
concentrated in an area of only 1 by 1 degree at a projected separation of less
than 15 kpc from the disk of M31. This HVC complex has a rather complicated
morphological and kinematical structure and partly overlaps with the giant
stellar stream of M31, suggesting a tidal origin. Another detected feature is
in close proximity, in both position and velocity, with NGC 205, perhaps also
indicative of tidal processes. Other HVCs in our survey are isolated and might
represent primordial, dark-matter dominated clouds.",2005-03-10T15:11:23Z
Second order perturbation theory for spin-orbit resonances,"We implement Lie transform perturbation theory to second order for the planar
spin-orbit problem. The perturbation parameter is the asphericity of the body,
with the orbital eccentricity entering as an additional parameter. We study
first and second order resonances for different values of these parameters. For
nearly spherical bodies like Mercury and the Moon first order perturbation
theory is adequate, whereas for highly aspherical bodies like Hyperion the spin
is mostly chaotic and perturbation theory is of limited use. However, in
between, we identify a parameter range where second order perturbation theory
is useful and where as yet unidentified objects may be in second order
resonances.",2005-05-27T16:54:56Z
The Geometric Distance and Proper Motion of the Triangulum Galaxy (M33),"We measured the angular rotation and proper motion of the Triangulum Galaxy
(M33) with the Very Long Baseline Array by observing two H2O masers on opposite
sides of the galaxy. By comparing the angular rotation rate with the
inclination and rotation speed, we obtained a distance of 730 +/- 168
kiloparsecs. This distance is consistent with the most recent Cepheid distance
measurement. M33 is moving with a velocity of 190 +/- 59 km/s relative to the
Milky Way. These measurements promise a new method to determine dynamical
models for the Local Group and the mass and dark matter halos of M31, M33 and
the Milky Way.",2005-03-02T22:26:07Z
"The OH (1720 MHz) Supernova Remnant Masers in W44: MERLIN and VLBA
  Polarization Observations","Full-polarization MERLIN and VLBA observations of the 1720-MHz maser emission
from the OH molecule in the supernova remnant W44 are presented. Zeeman
splitting has been directly resolved between right- and left-circularly
polarized spectra indicating magnetic field strengths of B~0.50 mG. The
position angle of the linear polarization is in good agreement with the
orientation of the shocked gas at the supernova remnant/molecular cloud
interface. Based on MERLIN data having a resolution of 200 milliarcseconds
(mas) and VLBA data with a resolution of 15 mas, the masers are measured to
have deconvolved angular sizes of 50 to 350 mas (150 to 1000 AU) with compact
cores 20 mas (60 AU) in size, consistent with theoretical expectation and
previous observations.",2005-03-22T18:28:20Z
The Rigidly Rotating Magnetosphere of Sigma Ori E,"We attempt to characterize the observed variability of the magnetic
helium-strong star sigma Ori E in terms of a recently developed rigidly
rotating magnetosphere model. This model predicts the accumulation of
circumstellar plasma in two co-rotating clouds, situated in magnetohydrostatic
equilibrium at the intersection between magnetic and rotational equators. We
find that the model can reproduce well the periodic modulations observed in the
star's light curve, H alpha emission-line profile, and longitudinal field
strength, confirming that it furnishes an essentially correct, quantitative
description of the star's magnetically controlled circumstellar environment.",2005-03-30T16:47:44Z
MERLIN monitoring of recent core-collapse supernovae,"The star formation rate (SFR) in starburst galaxies can be measured by many
methods, one of which is through the supernova rate. Due to the heavy dust
obscuration in these galaxies, searches for new supernovae in the optical or
infra-red can easily miss events occurring in the central starburst regions. As
part of a long term program to estimate the SFR in a sample of nearby
starbursts we are using MERLIN and the VLA to regularly observe the galaxies
for new radio supernovae. As part of this project, regular MERLIN observations
have been made of two recent optically bright supernovae: 2004dj and 2004et.
Both supernovae are of Type II and have been monitored frequently over periods

"[O II] Emission in Quasar Host Galaxies: Evidence for a Suppressed Star
  Formation Efficiency","The [O II] 3727 line, a commonly used estimator of star formation rate in
extragalactic surveys, should be an equally effective tracer of star formation
in the host galaxies of quasars, whose narrow-line regions are expected to
produce weak low-ionization emission. Quasar spectra generally show little or
no [O II] emission beyond that expected from the active nucleus itself. The
inferred star formation rates in optically selected quasars are typically below
a few solar masses per yr, and some significantly less. Quasars do not appear
to occur coevally with starbursts. Recent observations, on the other hand,
reveal abundant molecular gas in low-redshift quasars. These two results
suggest that the star formation efficiency in quasar host galaxies is somehow
suppressed during the active phase of the nucleus. The low star formation rates
also imply that the nonstellar nucleus powers the bulk of the thermal infrared
emission in radio-quiet quasars.",2005-04-28T17:20:23Z
COUP census of X-ray stars in BN-KL and OMC-1S,"We present a study of the X-ray sources detected in the vicinity of two
density peaks in the Orion Molecular Cloud 1 (OMC-1) behind the Orion Nebula
Cluster (ONC), as seen in the exceptionally deep (~10 days) exposure of the
Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP). We focus on a 40""*50"" region around the
Becklin-Neugebauer object and Kleinmann-Low nebula (collectively BN-KL) and a
60""*75"" region around OMC-1S, a secondary star-forming peak some 90"" south of
BN-KL. Forty-three and sixty X-ray sources were detected in BN-KL and OMC-1S,
respectively, of which half and one-third, respectively, were found to be
foreground members of the ONC, while the remaining sources are identified as
obscured X-ray sources with column densities 22<log(NH)/cm^{-2})<24. All but 5
and 18 of these sources have near-infrared stellar counterparts, and 22 of
these appear to be young stellar objects (YSOs). X-ray sources are found close
to four luminous mid-IR sources namely BN, IRc3-i2, IRc2-C, and Source n; their
X-ray variability and spectral properties are typical of coronal activity in
low-mass stars rather than wind emission from massive stars, suggesting that
the X-ray emission may be arising from companions. The X-ray light curve of the
X-ray source close to BN shows a periodicity of ~8.3 days and from an X-ray
image deconvolution of the region around BN, we conclude that either BN itself
or a low mass companion with a projected separation of ~200 AU was detected. On
the other hand, no emission is seen from the bright radio Source I, held by
some to be the main source of luminosity in BN-KL. In OMC-1S, Chandra unveils a
new subcluster of seven YSOs without infrared counterparts (abridged).",2005-04-08T14:27:36Z
"IRAC Mid-Infrared Imaging of the Hubble Deep Field South: Star Formation
  Histories and Stellar Masses of Red Galaxies at z>2","We present deep 3.6 - 8 micron imaging of the Hubble Deep Field South with
IRAC on the Spitzer Space Telescope. We study Distant Red Galaxies (DRGs) at
z>2 selected by Js - Ks > 2.3 and compare them to a sample of Lyman Break
Galaxies (LBGs) at z=2-3. The observed UV-to-8 micron spectral energy
distributions are fit with stellar population models to constrain star
formation histories and derive stellar masses. We find that 70% of the DRGs are
best described by dust-reddened star forming models and 30% are very well fit
with old and ``dead'' models. Using only the I - Ks and Ks - 4.5 micron colors
we can effectively separate the two groups. The dead systems are among the most
massive at z~2.5 (mean stellar mass <M*> = 0.8 x 10^11 Msun) and likely formed
most of their stellar mass at z>5. To a limit of 0.5 x 10^11 Msun their number
density is ~10 x lower than that of local early-type galaxies. Furthermore, we
use the IRAC photometry to derive rest-frame near-infrared J, H, and K fluxes.
The DRGs and LBGs together show a large variation (a factor of 6) in the
rest-frame K-band mass-to-light ratios (M/L_K), implying that even a Spitzer 8
micron-selected sample would be very different from a mass-selected sample. The
average M/L_K of the DRGs is about three times higher than that of the LBGs,
and DRGs dominate the high-mass end. The M/L_K ratios and ages of the two
samples appear to correlate with derived stellar mass, with the most massive
galaxies being the oldest and having the highest mass-to-light ratios, similar
as found in the low-redshift universe.",2005-04-08T23:53:26Z
"Neutrino masses and the dark energy equation of state - relaxing the
  cosmological neutrino mass bound","Cosmology at present provides the nominally strongest constraint on the
masses of standard model neutrinos. However, this constraint extremely
dependent on the nature of the dark energy component of the Universe. When the
dark energy equation of state parameter is taken as a free (but constant)
parameter, the neutrino mass bound is sum m_nu < 1.48 eV (95% C.L.), compared
with sum m_nu < 0.65 eV (95% C.L.) in the standard model where the dark energy
is in the form of a cosmological constant. This has important consequences for
future experiments aimed at the direct measurement of neutrino masses. We also
discuss prospects for future cosmological measurements of neutrino masses.",2005-05-27T19:54:45Z
X-ray spectroscopy of PSR B1951+32 and its pulsar wind nebula,"We present spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy of PSR B1951+32 and its
pulsar wind nebula (PWN) in supernova remnant (SNR) CTB 80 using a {\sl
Chandra} observation. The {\sl Chandra} X-ray map reveals clearly various
components of a ram-pressure confined PWN embedded in the SNR ejecta: a point
source representing the pulsar, X-ray emission from the bow shock, a luminous
X-ray tail, a 30$\arcsec$ diameter plateau whose northwestern part is absent,
and the outside more diffuse X-ray emission. The plateau is just surrounded by
the radio, [O III], [S II], and [N II] shells, and the outside diffuse emission
is mostly within the H${\alpha}$ shells. While the spectra of all the features
are well fitted with power law models, a power law plus blackbody model can fit
the spectrum of the pulsar significantly better than using a power law model
alone. Generally the spectra of these components obey the trend of steepening
from the inside to the outside. However, the edge of the plateau probably has a
harder spectrum than that of the central region of the plateau. The cause of
the apparent hard spectrum of the plateau edge is unclear, and we speculate
that it might be due to a shock between the PWN and the SNR ejecta. The
possible blackbody radiation component from the pulsar has a temperature of
0.13$\pm0.02$ keV and an equivalent emitting radius of 2.2$^{+1.4}_{-0.8}$ (d/2
kpc) km, and is thus probably from the hot spots on the pulsar. We also show in
this paper that the blackbody temperature of the entire surface of PSR B1951+32
is much lower than those predicted by the standard neutron star cooling models.",2005-04-13T10:26:31Z
"The composition and size distribution of the dust in the coma of comet
  Hale-Bopp","We discuss the composition and size distribution of the dust in the coma of
comet Hale-Bopp. We do this by fitting simultaneously the infrared emission
spectrum measured by the infrared space observatory (ISO) and the measured
degree of linear polarization of scattered light at various phase angles and 12
different wavelengths. The effects of particle shape on the modeled optical
properties of the dust grains are taken into account. We constrain our fit by
forcing the abundances of the major rock forming chemical elements to be solar.
The infrared spectrum at long wavelengths reveals that large grains are needed
in order to fit the spectral slope. The size and shape distribution we employ
allows us to estimate the sizes of the crystalline silicates. The ratios of the
strength of various forsterite features show that the crystalline silicate
grains in Hale-Bopp must be submicron sized. We exclude the presence of large
crystalline silicate grains in the coma. Because of this lack of large
crystalline grains combined with the fact that we do need large amorphous
grains to fit the emission spectrum at long wavelengths, we need only
approximately 4% of crystalline silicates by mass. After correcting for
possible hidden crystalline material included in large amorphous grains, our
best estimate of the total mass fraction of crystalline material is
approximately 7.5%, significantly lower than deduced in previous studies in
which the typical derived crystallinity is 20-30%. The implications of this on
the possible origin and evolution of the comet are discussed. The crystallinity
we observe in Hale-Bopp is consistent with the production of crystalline
silicates in the inner solar system by thermal annealing and subsequent radial
mixing to the comet forming region.",2005-05-30T16:26:58Z
"Tests of a Prototype Multiplexed Fiber-Optic Ultra-fast FADC Data
  Acquisition System for the MAGIC Telescope","Ground-based Atmospheric Air Cherenkov Telescopes (ACTs) are successfully
used to observe very high energy (VHE) gamma rays from celestial objects. The
light of the night sky (LONS) is a strong background for these telescopes. The
gamma ray pulses being very short, an ultra-fast read-out of an ACT can
minimize the influence of the LONS. This allows one to lower the so-called tail
cuts of the shower image and the analysis energy threshold. It could also help
to suppress other unwanted backgrounds.
  Fast 'flash' analog-to-digital converters (FADCs) with GSamples/s are
available commercially; they are, however, very expensive and power consuming.
Here we present a novel technique of Fiber-Optic Multiplexing which uses a
single 2 GSamples/s FADC to digitize 16 read-out channels consecutively. The
analog signals are delayed by using optical fibers. The multiplexed (MUX) FADC
read-out reduces the cost by about 85% compared to using one ultra-fast FADC
per read-out channel.
  Two prototype multiplexers, each digitizing data from 16 channels, were built
and tested. The ultra-fast read-out system will be described and the test
results will be reported. The new system will be implemented for the read-out
of the 17m diameter MAGIC telescope camera.",2005-05-10T19:04:02Z
The ALHAMBRA Survey: For a systematic Study of Cosmic Evolution,"ALHAMBRA is a project to gather data to sample a fraction of the Universe
with enough precision to follow the evolution of its content and properties
with z, a kind of Cosmic Tomography. It is defined as a 4 square degrees
photometric survey with 20 contiguous, equal width, medium band filters
covering from 3500 to 9700 A, plus the JHKs NIR bands. It was optimized to get
(for a fixed observing time) the maximum number of objects with accurate
classification and redshift and to be sensitive to relatively faint emission
features. The observations will be carried out with the 3.5m telescope in Calar
Alto (Spain). We intend to reach the limit AB=25 in all the optical filters
from the bluest to 8300 A, and from 24.7 to 23.4 for the remainder. The
expected limit in the NIR is fixed at Ks=20, H=21, J=22. The homogeneous and
contiguous spectral coverage will result in several hundred thousand objects
with accurate SED identification and z-values. The accuracy of the survey will
allow to make detailed studies, including galactic, without the need for any
further follow-up. Indeed, it will provide exciting targets for large
telescopes, the GTC in particular.",2005-04-25T15:23:58Z
Magnetic Fields in High-Density Stellar Matter,"I briefly review some aspects of the effect of magnetic fields in the high

Unstable Bar and Spiral Modes of Disk Galaxies,"We study bisymmetric modes of angular wavenumber 2 for flat stellar disks in
potentials with smooth cores. Stars either all circulate in the same direction
or a small fraction may counter-rotate. The bisymmetric modes are unstable
unless there is a sufficiently large external halo or bulge. We find two modes
for each disk: a more central fundamental mode and a more extensive and more
spiral (trailing) secondary mode. The fundamental mode is particularly
sensitive to the orbital population in the central part of the disk. Depending
on that population, it varies from a small compact bar to a trailing spiral
that is almost as wound as the secondary mode. All modes rotate too rapidly for
there to be an inner Lindblad resonance. They transfer angular momentum from
the central to the outer regions of the disk. Most of them release
gravitational energy and convert it to kinetic energy, which also flows
outwards through the disk.",2005-03-11T10:28:30Z
Dark matter from extra dimensions,"In brane-world models with low tension, massive branons are natural
candidates for dark matter. The phenomenology of these WIMP-like particles is
completely determined by their mass, the brane tension and, in the case of
effects due to radiative corrections, by the cutoff setting the scale of
validity of the branon effective theory. In this paper, we review the main
constraints on branon physics coming from colliders, astrophysics and
cosmological observations, and include more recent limits obtained from
electroweak precision measurements.",2005-03-29T15:02:51Z
"An X-ray study of magnetic field strengths and particle content in FRII
  radio sources","We present a Chandra and XMM-Newton study of X-ray emission from the lobes of
33 classical double radio galaxies and quasars. We report new detections of
lobe-related X-ray emission in 11 sources. Together with previous detections we
find that X-ray emission is detected from at least one radio lobe in ~75
percent of the sample. For all of the lobe detections, we find that the
measured X-ray flux can be attributed to inverse-Compton scattering of the
cosmic microwave background radiation, with magnetic field strengths in the
lobes between (0.3 - 1.3) B_eq, where the value B_eq corresponds to
equipartition between the electrons and magnetic field assuming a filling
factor of unity. There is a strong peak in the magnetic field strength
distribution at B ~ 0.7 B_eq. We find that > 70 percent of the radio lobes are
either at equipartition or electron dominated by a small factor. The
distribution of measured magnetic field strengths differs for narrow-line and
broad-line objects, in the sense that broad-line radio galaxies and quasars
appear to be further from equipartition; however, this is likely to be due to a
combination of projection effects and worse systematic uncertainty in the X-ray
analysis for those objects. Our results suggest that the lobes of classical
double radio sources do not contain an energetically dominant proton
population, because this would require the magnetic field energy density to be
similar to the electron energy density rather than the overall energy density
in relativistic particles.",2005-03-09T19:51:19Z
A large HI cloud near the centre of the Virgo cluster,"We report the discovery of a large HI cloud in the central regions of the
Virgo cluster. It is 110 x 25 kpc in size and contains 3.4 x 10^8 Msol of HI.
The morphology and kinematics of this cloud strongly suggest that it consists
of HI removed from the galaxy NGC 4388 by ram-pressure stripping. It is more
likely the result of an interaction of the ISM of NGC 4388 with the hot halo of
the M86 group and not with the ICM centred on M87. The large extent of the
plume suggests that gas stripped from cluster galaxies can remain neutral for
at least 10^8 yr. Locally, the column density is well above 10^20 cm^-2,
suggesting that the intra-cluster HII regions known to exist in Virgo may have
formed from gas stripped from cluster galaxies. The existence of the HI plume
suggests that stripping of infalling spirals contributes to the enrichment of
the ICM. The HI object in the Virgo cluster recently reported by Minchin et al.
may have a similar origin and may therefore not be a ``dark galaxy''.",2005-05-19T07:58:26Z
"Effects of collisions and interactions on star formation in galaxy pairs
  in the field","By using cosmological simulations, we studied the effects of galaxy
interactionson the star formation activity in the local Universe. We selected
galaxy pairs from the 3D galaxy distribution according to a proximity
criterion. The 2D galaxy catalog was constructed by projecting the 3D total
galaxy distribution and then selecting projected galaxy pairs. The analysis of
the 3D galaxy pair catalog showed that an enhancement of the star formation
activity can be statistically correlated with proximity.
  The projected galaxy pairs exhibited a similar trend with projected distances
and relative radial velocities. However, the star formation enhancement signal
is diminished with respect to that of the 3D galaxy pair catalog owing to
projection effects and spurious galaxy pairs. Overall, we found that
hierarchical scenarios reproduced the observational dependence of star
formation activity in pairs on orbital parameters and environment. We also
found that geometrical effects due to projection modify the trends more
severely than those introduced by spurious pairs.",2005-04-17T16:39:35Z
A solar active region loop compared with a 2D MHD model,"We analyzed a coronal loop observed with the Normal Incidence Spectrometer
(NIS), which is part of the Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (CDS) on board the
Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The measured Doppler shifts and
proper motions along the selected loop strongly indicate unidirectional flows.
Analysing the Emission Measure Curves of the observed spectral lines, we
estimated that the temperature along the loop was about 380000 K. We adapted a
solution of the ideal MHD steady equations to our set of measurements. The
derived energy balance along the loop, as well as the advantages/disadvantages
of this MHD model for understanding the characteristics of solar coronal loops
are discussed.",2005-03-31T13:35:04Z
The proto--neutron--star dynamo -- viability and impediments,"We study convective motions taken from hydrodynamic simulations of rotating
proto--neutron stars (PNSs) with respect to their ability to excite a dynamo
instability which may be responsible for the giant neutron star magnetic
fields. Since it is impossible to simulate the magnetic field evolution
employing the actual magnetic Reynolds numbers ($\Rm$) resulting from the
hydrodynamic simulations, (smallest) critical $\Rm$s and the corresponding
field geometries are derived on the kinematic level by rescaling the velocity
amplitudes. It turns out that the actual values of $\Rm$ are by many orders of
magnitude larger than the critical values found. A dynamo might therefore start
to act vigorously very soon after the onset of convection. But as in general
dynamo growth rates are non--monotonous functions of $\Rm$ the later fate of
the magnetic field is uncertain. Hence, no reliable statements on the existence
and efficiency of PNS dynamos can be drawn without considering the interplay of
magnetic field and convection from the beginning. Likewise, in so far as
convection inside the PNS is regarded to be essential in re--launching the
supernova explosion, a revision of its role in this respect could turn out to
be necessary.",2005-02-14T21:41:37Z
Evolving turbulence and magnetic fields in galaxy clusters,"We discuss, using simple analytical models and MHD simulations, the origin
and parameters of turbulence and magnetic fields in galaxy clusters. Three
physically distinct regimes can be identified in the evolution of cluster
turbulence and magnetic fields. Firstly, the fluctuation dynamo will produce
microgauss-strong, random magnetic fields during cluster formation and major
mergers. Turbulent velocity of about 300 km/s can be maintained at scales
100-200 kpc. The magnetic field is intermittent, has a smaller scale of 20-30
kpc and average strength of 2 microgauss. Secondly, when major mergers end,
turbulent speed and magnetic field undergo a power-law decay, decreasing in
strength but increasing in scale by a factor of about two. Thirdly,
smaller-mass subclusters and cluster galaxies produce turbulent wakes, with
turbulent speeds and magnetic field strengths similar to those quoted above.
The velocity scales are about 200 kpc and 10 kpc respectively, and the magnetic
field scale is about 6 times smaller. Although these wakes may fill only a
small fraction of the cluster volume, their area covering factor can be close
to unity. So one can potentially reconcile observations that indicate the
coexistence of turbulence with ordered filamentary gas structures, as in the
Perseus cluster. Random Faraday rotation measure is estimated to be typically
100-200 rad/m^2, in agreement with observations. We predict detectable
synchrotron polarization from cluster radio halos at wavelengths 3-6 cm, if
observed at sufficiently high resolution (abridged).",2005-05-07T18:07:23Z
Where Are The M Dwarf Disks Older Than 10 Million Years?,"We present 11.7-micron observations of nine late-type dwarfs obtained at the
Keck I 10-meter telescope in December 2002 and April 2003. Our targets were
selected for their youth or apparent IRAS 12-micron excess. For all nine
sources, excess infrared emission is not detected. We find that stellar wind
drag can dominate the circumstellar grain removal and plausibly explain the
dearth of M Dwarf systems older than 10 Myr with currently detected infrared
excesses. We predict M dwarfs possess fractional infrared excess on the order
of L_{IR}/L_{*}\sim10^{-6} and this may be detectable with future efforts.",2005-06-07T07:23:20Z
Precursors of UCHII regions & the evolution of massive outflows,"Since this contributions was meant to cover two subjects which are both in
the field of massive star formation but which in its details can be discussed
separately, this paper is divided in two sections. First, we present
characteristics of precursors of UCH{\sc ii} regions and their likely
evolutionary properties. The second section discusses massive molecular
outflows, their implications for high-mass star formation, and a possible
evolutionary sequence for massive outflows.",2005-02-10T14:52:33Z
On the mass distribution of neutron stars in HMXBs,"We present the results of a monitoring campaign of three eclipsing high-mass
X-ray binaries (HMXBs: SMC X-1, LMC X-4 and Cen X-3). High-resolution VLT/UVES
spectra are used to measure the radial velocities of these systems with high
accuracy. We show that the subsequent mass determination of the neutron stars
in these systems is significantly improved and discuss the implications of this
result.",2005-02-16T11:41:01Z
On ion-ion correlation effects during stellar core collapse,"The role of ion-ion correlations in suppressing neutrino-nucleus elastic
scattering during stellar core collapse is reinvestigated, using two different
equations of state. We test the improved description by Itoh et al. against the
treatment suggested by Horowitz and find that the stronger cross section
reduction for small momentum transfer in the former case does not lead to
noticeable changes of the core deleptonization and entropy increase during
collapse, because the improvements are relevant below neutrino trapping
conditions only for very low neutrino energies, corresponding to a very small
phase space volume. Treating screening effects for ionic mixtures by the linear
mixing rule, applied to the collection of representative heavy nucleus, alpha
particles, and free nucleons, which is assumed to characterize the composition
in nuclear statistical equilibrium, we cannot determine mentionable differences
during stellar collapse, because alpha particles are not sufficiently abundant
and their coherent scattering opacity is too small.",2005-04-13T08:45:07Z
A Possible Hidden Population of Spherical Planetary Nebulae,"We argue that relative to non-spherical planetary nebulae (PNs), spherical
PNs are about an order of magnitude less likely to be detected, at distances of
several kiloparsecs. Noting the structure similarity of halos around
non-spherical PNs to that of observed spherical PNs, we assume that most
unobserved spherical PNs are also similar in structure to the spherical halos
around non-spherical PNs. The fraction of non-spherical PNs with detected
spherical halos around them, taken from a recent study, leads us to the claim
of a large (relative to that of non-spherical PNs) hidden population of
spherical PNs in the visible band. Building a toy model for the luminosity
evolution of PNs, we show that the claimed detection fraction of spherical PNs
based on halos around non-spherical PNs, is compatible with observational
sensitivities. We use this result to update earlier studies on the different PN
shaping routes in the binary model. We estimate that ~30% of all PNs are
spherical, namely, their progenitors did not interact with any binary
companion. This fraction is to be compared with the ~3% fraction of observed
spherical PNs among all observed PNs. From all PNs, ~15% owe their moderate
elliptical shape to the interaction of their progenitors with planets, while
\~55% of all PNs owe their elliptical or bipolar shapes to the interaction of
their progenitors with stellar companions.",2005-03-14T13:46:49Z
"Spectroscopic study of the long-period dust-producing WC7pd+O9 binary
  HD192641","We present the results of an optical spectroscopic study of the massive
Wolf-Rayet binary WR137. These data cover the dust-formation maximum in 1997.
Combining all available measurements of radial velocities, we derive, for the
first time, a spectroscopic orbit with period 13.05 +/- 0.18 years. The
resulting masses, adopting i=67degrees, are M(O)= 20 +/- 2 Mo and M(WR)= 4.4+/-
1.5 Mo. These appear, respectively, around normal and on the low side for the
given spectral types. Analysis of the intense multi-site spectroscopic
monitoring in 1999 shows that the CIII5696 and CIV5802/12 lines have the
highest intrinsic variability levels. The periodogram analysis yields a
small-amplitude modulation in the absorption troughs of the CIV5802/12 and
HeI5876 lines with a period of 0.83 days, which could be related either to
pulsations or large-scale rotating structures as seen in the WN4 star EZ Canis
Majoris (WR6).Wavelet analysis of the strong emission lines of CIII5696 and
CIV5802/12 enabled us to isolate and follow for several hours small structures
associated with density enhancements within the wind of the Wolf-Rayet star.
Cross-correlating the variability patterns seen in different lines, we find a
weak but significant correlation between the varability in emission lines with
different ionization potential, i.e. in lines formed at different distances
from the WR stellar core. Adopting a beta wind-velocity law, from the motion of
individual subpeaks we find beta around 5, which is significantly larger than
the canonical value of 1 usually found in O-star winds.",2005-04-21T16:33:23Z
Evolution of field early-type galaxies: The view from GOODS/CDFS,"(Abridged) We explore the evolution of field early-type galaxies on a sample
extracted from GOODS/CDFS. The galaxies are selected by means of a
non-parametric analysis followed by visual inspection. We exclude those
galaxies which are not consistent with an evolution into the Kormendy relation.
The final set comprises 249 galaxies with a median redshift z=0.7. The
distribution of number counts versus apparent magnitude suggests a substantial
decrease of the comoving number density with redshift. The majority of the
galaxies feature passively evolving old stellar populations. One third of those
in the upper half of the redshift distribution have blue colors, in contrast to
only 10% in the lower redshift subsample. An adaptive binning of the color maps
is performed to explore the internal color distribution. We find that most blue
galaxies in our sample feature blue cores whereas most of the red early-types
are passively evolving stellar populations with red cores. The color gradients
and scatter do not evolve with redshift and are compatible with the
observations at z=0 assuming a radial dependence of the metallicity within each
galaxy. This work emphasizes the need for a careful sample selection, as we
found that most of those galaxies which were visually classified as early types
-- but then rejected based on the Kormendy relation -- feature blue colors
characteristic of recent star formation.",2005-04-05T20:17:56Z
Can gamma-ray bursts constrain quintessence?,"Using the narrow clustering of the geometrically corrected gamma-ray energies
released by gamma-ray bursts, we investigate the possibility of using these
sources as standard candles to probe cosmological parameters such as the matter
density Omega_m and the cosmological constant energy density Omega_Lambda. By
simulating different samples of gamma-ray bursts, we find that Omega_m can be
determined with accuracy ~7% with data from 300 sources. We also show that, if
Omega = 1 is due to a quintessence field, some of the models proposed in the
literature may be discriminated from a Universe with cosmological constant, by
a similar-sized sample of gamma-ray bursts.",2005-04-27T08:34:56Z
"Low-Frequency Gravitational Radiation from Coalescing Massive Black
  Holes","We compute the expected low-frequency gravitational wave signal from
coalescing massive black hole (MBH) binaries at the center of galaxies. We
follow the merging history of halos and associated holes via cosmological Monte
Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy from early times to the present in a
LCDM cosmology. MBHs get incorporated through a series of mergers into larger
and larger halos, sink to the centre owing to dynamical friction, accrete a
fraction of the gas in the merger remnant to become more massive, and form a
binary system. Stellar dynamical processes dominates the orbital evolution of
the binary at large separations, while gravitational wave emission takes over
at small radii, causing the final coalescence of the system. We discuss the
observability of inspiraling MBH binaries by a low-frequency gravitational wave
experiment such as the planned Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA),
discriminating between resolvable sources and unresolved confusion noise. Over
a 3-year observing period LISA should resolve this GWB into discrete sources,
detecting ~90 individual events above a S/N=5 confidence level, while expected
confusion noise is well below planned LISA capabilities.",2005-02-22T17:04:40Z
"The evolution of the timing properties of the black-hole transient GX
  339-4 during its 2002/2003 outburst","We present the results of the timing and color analysis of more than two
hundred RXTE/PCA observations of the bright black-hole transient GX 339-4
obtained during its 2002/2003 outburst. The color-intensity evolution of the
system, coupled to the properties of its fast time variability, allow the
identification of four separate states. Depending on the state, strong noise is
detected, together with a variety of quasi-periodic oscillations at frequencies
from 0.2 to 8 Hz. We present a characterization of the timing parameters of
these states and compare them to what has been observed in other systems. These
results, together with those obtained from energy spectra, point towards a
common evolution of black-hole transients through their outbursts.",2005-04-26T18:20:19Z
Exact solution of the standard transfer problem in a stellar atmosphere,"We come back to the analytical solution of the standard transfer problem in a
stellar atmosphere. It consists in solving the radiative transfer equation in a
homogeneous and isothermal plane-parallel atmosphere, with light scattering
taken as isotropic and monochromatic. The literature on the subject is reviewed
and the existing solution in a finite slab is improved thanks to the
introduction of non classical auxiliary functions. Eleven-figure tables of the
solution are given for typical values of the input parameters currently met in
stellar atmospheres.",2005-04-03T13:59:17Z
On virialization with dark energy,"We review the inclusion of dark energy into the formalism of spherical
collapse, and the virialization of a two-component system, made of matter and
dark energy. We compare two approaches in previous studies. The first assumes
that only the matter component virializes, e.g. as in the case of a classic
cosmological constant. The second approach allows the full system to virialize
as a whole. We show that the two approaches give fundamentally different
results for the final state of the system. This might be a signature
discriminating between the classic cosmological constant which cannot virialize
and a dynamical dark energy mimicking a cosmological constant. This signature
is independent of the measured value of the equation of state. An additional
issue which we address is energy non-conservation of the system, which
originates from the homogeneity assumption for the dark energy. We propose a
way to take this energy loss into account.",2005-05-14T13:56:17Z
"Particle Swarm Optimization: An efficient method for tracing periodic
  orbits in 3D galactic potentials","We propose the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as an alternative method for
locating periodic orbits in a three--dimensional (3D) model of barred galaxies.
We develop an appropriate scheme that transforms the problem of finding
periodic orbits into the problem of detecting global minimizers of a function,
which is defined on the Poincar\'{e} Surface of Section (PSS) of the
Hamiltonian system. By combining the PSO method with deflection techniques, we
succeeded in tracing systematically several periodic orbits of the system. The
method succeeded in tracing the initial conditions of periodic orbits in cases
where Newton iterative techniques had difficulties. In particular, we found
families of 2D and 3D periodic orbits associated with the inner 8:1 to 12:1
resonances, between the radial 4:1 and corotation resonances of our 3D Ferrers
bar model. The main advantages of the proposed algorithm is its simplicity, its
ability to work using function values solely, as well as its ability to locate
many periodic orbits per run at a given Jacobian constant.",2005-02-08T15:51:56Z
Modeling the formation of galaxy clusters in MOND,"We use a one dimensional hydrodynamical code to study the evolution of
spherically symmetric perturbations in the framework of Modified Newtonian
Dynamics (MOND). The code evolves spherical gaseous shells in an expanding
Universe by employing a MOND-type relationship between the fluctuations in the
density field and the gravitational force, $g$. We focus on the evolution of
initial density perturbations of the form $\delta_{i}\sim r_{i}^{-s}$ for
$0<s<3$. A shell is initially cold and remains so until it encounters the shock
formed by the earlier collapse of shells nearer to the centre. During the early
epochs $g$ is sufficiently large and shells move according to Newtonian
gravity. As the physical size of the perturbation increases with time, $g$ gets
smaller and the evolution eventually becomes MOND dominated. However, the
density in the inner collapsed regions is large enough that they re-enter the
Newtonian regime. The evolved gas temperature and density profiles tend to a
universal form that is independent of the the slope, $s$, and of the initial
amplitude. An analytic explanation of this intriguing result is offered. Over a
wide range of scales, the temperature, density and entropy profiles in the
simulations, depend on radius roughly like $r^{0.5}$, $r^{-1.5}$ and $r^{1.5}$,
respectively. We compare our results with XMM-{\it Newton} and {\it Chandra}
observations of clusters. The temperature profiles of 16 observed clusters are
either flat or show a mild decrease at $R\gtsim 200\rm kpc$. MOND profiles show
a significant increase that cannot reconciled with the data. Our simulated MOND
clusters are substantially denser than the observed clusters. It remains to be
seen whether these difficulties persist in three-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations with generic initial conditions.",2005-05-05T12:17:41Z
Systematic Effects in CMB Polarization Measurements,"The cosmic microwave background polarization is rich of cosmological
information complementary to those from temperature anisotropies. Linear
polarization can be decomposed uniquely in two components of opposite parities,
called E and B. While E mode allows measurement of cosmological parameters in a
way independent from temperature, B mode allows to detect the primordial
gravitational waves produced during inflation, and thus to determine its energy
scale. However, measuring CMB polarization is complicated by foregrounds, whose
polarization is poorly known, and by systematic effects, which mainly affects B
mode measurement because of its low level. As an example, we show here the
effect of beams uncertainty on polarization measurement in the case of the
Planck HFI instrument, and how we can correct for it.",2005-02-09T14:19:14Z
"The structural and scaling properties of nearby galaxy clusters - II.
  The M-T relation","Using a sample of ten nearby (z< 0.15), relaxed galaxy clusters in the
temperature range [2-9] keV, we have investigated the scaling relation between
the mass at various density contrasts (delta=2500,1000,500,200) and the cluster
temperature. The masses are derived from NFW-type model fits to mass profiles,
obtained under the hydrostatic assumption using precise measurements, with XMM,
at least down to delta=1000. The logarithmic slope of the M-T relation is well
constrained and is the same at all delta, reflecting the self-similarity of the
mass profiles. At delta=500, the slope of the relation for the sub-sample of
hot clusters (kT>3.5 keV) is consistent with the standard self-similar
expectation: alpha= 1.49\pm0.15. The relation steepens when the whole sample is
considered: alpha=1.71\pm0.09. The normalisation of the relation is discrepant
(by ~ 30%), at all density contrasts, with the prediction from purely
gravitation based models. Models that take into account radiative cooling and
galaxy feedback are generally in better agreement with our data. We argue that
remaining discrepancies, in particular at low delta, are more likely due to
problems with models of the ICM thermal structure rather than to an incorrect
estimate of the mass from X-ray data.",2005-02-10T10:26:50Z
"On the effect of the inhomogeneous subsurface flows on the high degree
  solar p-modes","The observed power spectrum of high-degree solar p-modes (l>200) shows
discrepancies with the power spectrum predicted by the stochastic excitement
and damping theory. In an attempt to explain these discrepancies, the present
paper is concerned with the influence of the observed subsurface flows on the
trapped acoustic modes (p-modes). The effect of these inhomogeneous background
flows is investigated by means of a non-modal analysis and a multi-layer model.
It is shown that the rotational and meridional components of the velocity field
change the wavelengths of the oscillation modes which, in turn, results in
modifications of the corresponding modal frequencies. The magnitudes of the
frequency residuals depend on the spatial scales of the modes and on the
gradients of the different components of the flow velocity. Together with other
mechanisms (e.g. the scattering of modes by the large scale convection
(Goldreich & Murray 1994), the non-modal effect of the variation of the
frequencies in time may contribute: 1) to the observed widening of the
corresponding peaks in the observed power spectrum with increasing angular
degree; 2) to the partial dissipation of spectral power, and, as a result, 3)
to the discrepancies between the predicted and the observed power spectrum of
solar p-modes.",2005-04-14T04:21:04Z
Stellar evolutionary models: uncertainties and systematics,"In this last decade, our knowledge of evolutionary and structural properties
of stars of different mass and chemical composition is significantly improved.
This result has been achieved as a consequence of our improved capability in
understanding and describing the physical behavior of stellar matter in the
different thermal regimes characteristic of the different stellar mass ranges
and/or evolutionary stages. This notwithstanding, current generation of stellar
models is still affected by significant and, usually, not negligible
uncertainties. These uncertainties are related to our poor knowledge of some
physical procceses occurring in the real stars such as, for instance, some
thermodynamical processes, nuclear reaction rates, as well as the efficiency of
mixing processes. These drawbacks of stellar models have to be properly taken
into account when comparing theory with observations in order to derive
relevant information about the properties of both resolved and unresolved
stellar populations. In this paper we review current uncertainties affecting
low-mass stellar models, i.e. those structures with mass in the range between
0.6Mo and 1.4Mo. We show what are the main sources of uncertainty along the
main evolutionary stages, and discuss the present level of agreement between
theory and observations concerning some selected features of the
Color-Magnitude Diagram of low-mass stars.",2005-06-08T08:15:49Z
"X-ray Absorption Line Spectroscopy of the Galactic Hot Interstellar
  Medium","We present an X-ray absorption line spectroscopic study of the large-scale
hot interstellar medium (HISM) in the Galaxy. We detect Ne IX K$_\alpha$
absorption lines in the {\sl Chandra} grating spectra of seven Galactic
low-mass X-ray binaries. Three of these sources also show absorption of O VII
K$_\alpha$, O VII K$_\beta$, and/or O VIII K$_\alpha$. Both centroid and width
of the lines are consistent with a Galactic HISM origin of the absorption. By
jointly fitting the multiple lines, accounting for line saturation and assuming
the collisional ionization equilibrium, we estimate the average absorbing gas
temperature as $\sim 2.4\pm0.3\times10^6$ K (90% confidence errors). We further
characterize the spatial density distribution of the gas as ${\rm
6.4_{-1.7}^{+2.4} exp(-|z|/1.2_{-0.5}^{+1.0} kpc) \times10^{-3}{\rm cm^{-3}}} $
(a disk morphology) or ${\rm 6.2_{-2.1}^{+3.8} [ 1 + (R/2.3_{-1.1}^{+1.6}
kpc)^2]^{-1} \times10^{-3} {\rm cm^{-3}}}$ (a sphere morphology), where $z$ and
$R$ are the distances from the Galactic plane and Galactic center (GC)
respectively. Since nearly all the sight-lines with significant absorption
lines detected are somewhat toward GC and at low Galactic latitudes, these
results could be severely biased. More observations toward off-GC sight-lines
and at high latitudes are urgently needed to further the study. Nevertheless,
the results demonstrate the excellent potential of X-ray absorption line
spectroscopy in the study of the HISM.",2005-02-11T21:35:00Z
"Ionization fronts and their interaction with density fluctuations:
  implications for reionization","The propagation of cosmological ionization fronts (I-fronts) during
reionization is strongly influenced by small-scale structure. Here we summarize
our recent attemps to understand the effect of this small-scale structure. We
present high resolution cosmological N-body simulations at high-z (z>6) which
resolve a wide range of halo mass, from minihalos to clusters of large, rare
halos. We also study how minihalos affect I-fronts, through simulations of
minihalo photoevaporation. Furthermore, we modify the I-front propagation
equations to account for evolving small-scale structure, and incorporate these
results into a semi-analytical reionization model. When intergalactic medium
clumping and minihalo clustering around sources are included, small-scale
structure affects reionization by slowing it down and extending it in time.
This helps to explain observations by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe,
which imply an early and extended reionization epoch. We also study how source
clustering affects the evolution and size of H II regions, finding, in
agreement with simulations, that H II regions usually expand, rarely shrinking.
Hence, ""relic H II regions'' are an exception, rather than the rule. When the
suppression of small-mass sources in already-ionized regions by Jeans-mass
filtering is accounted for, H II regions are smaller, delaying overlap. We also
present a new numerical method for radiative transfer which is fast, efficient,
and easily coupled to hydrodynamics and N-body codes, along with sample tests
and applications.",2005-05-06T19:37:45Z
"The Redshift Distribution of Distant Supernovae and its Use in Probing
  Reionization","We model the number of detectable supernovae (SNe) as a function of redshift
at different flux thresholds, making use of the observed properties of local
SNe, such as their lightcurves, fiducial spectra, and peak magnitude
distributions. We obtain a rate of 0.4-2.3 SNe/arcmin^2/yr at z > 5 at the near
infrared (4.5 micron) flux density threshold of 3 nJy (achievable with the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in a 10^5 s integration). In a hypothetical
one-year survey, it should be possible to detect up to several thousand SNe per
unit redshift at z > 6. We discuss the possible application of such a large
sample of distant SNe as a probe of the epoch of reionization. By heating the
intergalactic medium and raising the cosmological Jeans mass, the process of
reionization can suppress star formation in low-mass galaxies. This could have
produced a relatively sharp drop in the SNR around the redshift of
reionization. We quantify the detectability of this feature in future surveys
of distant SNe by varying the redshift and duration of the feature, as well as
its impact on the SFR in low-mass halos, which results in different redshifts,
widths, and sizes of the drop in the expected SFR. We find that the drop can be
detected out to z_re ~ 13, as long as (i) the reionization history contains a
relatively rapid feature which is synchronized over different regions to within
\Delta z < 1 - 3, (ii) the star-formation efficiency in halos that dominate
reionization is ~ 10%, and (iii) reionization significantly suppresses the star
formation in low-mass halos. Depending on the details of (i) - (iii), this
could be achieved with a survey lasting less than two weeks. Detecting this
signature would also help elucidate the feedback mechanism that regulates
reionization.",2005-05-06T19:50:00Z
"Charges in gravitational fields: from Fermi, via Hanni-Ruffini-Wheeler,
  to the ""electric Meissner effect""","Recent developments in obtaining a detailed model for gamma ray bursts have
shown the need for a deeper understanding of phenomena described by solutions
of the Einstein-Maxwell equations, reviving interest in the behavior of charges
close to a black hole. In particular a drastic difference has been found
between the lines of force of a charged test particle in the fields of
Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom black holes. This difference characterizes
a general relativistic effect for the electric field of a charged test particle
around a (charged) Reissner-Nordstrom black hole similar to the ""Meissner
effect"" for a magnetic field around a superconductor. These new results are
related to earlier work by Fermi and Hanni-Ruffini-Wheeler.",2005-03-21T17:43:59Z
Supernovae Shedding Light on Gamma-Ray Bursts,"We review the observational status of the Supernova (SN)/Gamma-Ray Burst
(GRB) connection. In section 2 we provide a short summary of the observational
properties of core-collapse SNe. In sections 3-6 we review the circumstantial
evidences and the direct observations that support the existence of a deep
connection between the death of massive stars and GRBs. Present data suggest
that SNe associated with GRBs form a heterogeneous class of objects including
both bright and faint Hypernovae and perhaps also `standard' Ib/c events. In
section 7, we provide an empirical estimate of the rate of Hypernovae, for a
``MilkyWay-like'' galaxy, of about $\sim 2.6\times 10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$ that may
imply the ratio GRB/Hypernovae to be in the range $\sim 0.03-0.7$. In the same
framework we find the ratio GRB/SNe-Ibc to be $\sim 0.008\div 0.05$. In section
8 we discuss the possible existence of a lag between the SN explosion and the
associated gamma-ray event. In the few SN/GRB associations so far discovered
the SN explosions and GRB events appear to go off simultaneously. In section 9
we present the conclusions and highlight the open problems that Swift hopefully
will allow us to solve.",2005-04-23T09:38:11Z
"Cosmic gamma-ray background from Type Ia supernovae revisited: Evidence
  for missing gamma-rays at MeV","The observed cosmic gamma-ray background at ~ MeV has often been attributed
to Type Ia supernovae (SNIa). Since SNIa is close to a standard candle, one can
calculate the gamma-ray intensity of SNIa integrated over redshifts fairly
accurately, once the evolution of the SNIa rate is known. The latest SNIa rate
measured at z < ~1.6 (Dahlen et al. 2004) indicates that the previous
calculations of the gamma-ray background consistently overestimated the SNIa
rate. With the new rate, we find that the SNIa contribution is an order of
magnitude smaller than observed, and thus new population(s) of sources should
be invoked.",2005-06-06T20:20:19Z
"Evidence for Granulation and Oscillations in Procyon from Photometry
  with the WIRE satellite","We report evidence for the granulation signal in the star Procyon A, based on
two photometric time series from the star tracker on the WIRE satellite. The
power spectra show evidence of excess power around 1 milliHz, consistent with
the detection of p-modes reported from radial velocity measurements. We see a
significant increase in the noise level below 3 milliHz, which we interpret as
the granulation signal. We have made a large set of numerical simulations to
constrain the amplitude and timescale of the granulation signal and the
amplitude of the oscillations. We find that the timescale for granulation is
T(gran) = 750(200) s, the granulation amplitude is 1.8(0.3) times solar, and
the amplitude of the p-modes is 8(3) ppm. We found the distribution of peak
heights in the observed power spectra to be consistent with that expected from
p-mode oscillations. However, the quality of the data is not sufficient to
measure the large separation or detect a comb-like structure, as seen in the
p-modes of the Sun. Comparison with the recent negative result from the MOST
satellite reveal that the MOST data must have an additional noise source that
prevented the detection of oscillations.",2005-04-21T13:54:58Z
The [Fe IV] Discrepancy: Constraining the Iron Abundances in Nebulae,"We study the current discrepancy between the model-predicted and measured
concentrations of Fe++ and Fe3+ in ionized nebulae. We calculate a set of
photoionization models, updated with the atomic data relevant to the problem,
and compare their results with those derived for the available nebulae where
both [Fe III] and [Fe IV] lines have been measured. Our new model results are
closer to the measured values than the results of previous calculations, but a
discrepancy remains. This discrepancy translates into an uncertainty in the
derived Fe abundances of a factor up to ~4. We explore the possible causes of
this discrepancy and find that errors in the Fe atomic data may be the most
likely explanation. The discrepancy can be fully accounted for by any of the
following changes: (1) an increase by a factor of ~10 in the recombination rate
(radiative plus dielectronic, or charge transfer) for Fe3+, (2) an increase by
a factor of 2-3 in the effective collision strengths for Fe++, or (3) a
decrease by a factor of 2-3 in the effective collision strengths for Fe3+. We
derive the Fe abundances implied by these three explanations and use the
results to constrain the degree of depletion of Fe in our sample nebulae. The
Galactic H II regions and planetary nebulae are found to have high depletion
factors, with less than 5% of their Fe atoms in the gas phase. The
extragalactic H II regions (LMC 30 Doradus, SMC N88A, and SBS 0335-052) have
somewhat lower depletions. The metal-deficient blue compact galaxy SBS 0335-052
could have from 13% to 40% of Fe in the gas phase. The depletions derived for
the different objects define a trend of increasing depletion at higher
metallicities.",2005-04-05T23:10:44Z
"Inhomogeneous distribution of mercury on the surfaces of rapidly
  rotating HgMn stars","Starspots are usually associated with the action of magnetic fields at the
stellar surfaces. However, recently an inhomogeneous chemical distribution of
mercury was found for the mercury-manganese (HgMn) star alpha And -- a
well-established member of a non-magnetic subclass of the chemically peculiar
stars of the upper main sequence. In this study we present first results of the
high-resolution survey of the HgII 3984 resonance line in the spectra of
rapidly rotating HgMn stars with atmospheric parameters similar to those of
alpha And. We use spectrum synthesis modelling and take advantage of the
Doppler resolution of the stellar surfaces to probe horizontal structure of
mercury distribution. Clear signatures of spots are found in the HgII 3984 line
profiles of HR 1185 and HR 8723. Two observations of the latter star separated
by two days give evidence for the line profile variability. We conclude that
inhomogeneous distribution of Hg is a common phenomenon for the rapidly
rotating HgMn stars in the 13000--13800 K effective temperature range
independently of the stellar evolutionary stage. These results establish
existence of a new class of spectrum variable spotted B-type stars. It is
suggested that the observed Hg inhomogeneities arise from dynamical
instabilities in the chemical diffusion processes and are unrelated to magnetic
phenomena.",2005-05-06T12:38:52Z
External Compton Radiation from Rapid Nonthermal Flares in Blazars,"In this paper we extend our approach to modeling multifrequency emission
variability from blazars to include external-radiation Compton (ERC) emission
and electron energy losses from inverse Compton scattering of seed photons
originating outside the jet. We consider seed-photon emission from a dusty
molecular torus and the broad line region (BLR) surrounding the central engine.
We establish constraints on the properties of the molecular torus and BLR under
which synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission dominates such that the results
obtained in our previous paper are applicable. The focus of this study is on
relative time delays between the light curves observed at different
frequencies. For definiteness, we consider emission resulting from a collision
between relativistic shocks, but the results apply more generally to conditions
involving acceleration of relativistic electrons and/or magnetic field
amplification at any type of front. Unlike SSC emission, ERC flares involving a
constant field of seed photons are not delayed by light travel time of the seed
photons. The main cause of delays is from radiative energy losses, which result
in frequency stratification behind the front and quench the flare first at the
highest frequencies, progressing to lower frequencies as time advances.
However, if the spectrum of electrons injected at the shock front is
characterized by a relatively high value of the minimum energy (a Lorentz
factor $\gamma_{min}\sim100$ is sufficient), the ERC flare in the X-ray band
can be delayed and may even peak after the injection has ceased. This effect is
strongly frequency dependent, with a longer lag at lower frequencies and an
X-ray spectral index that changes rapidly from positive (inverted spectrum) to
steep values.",2005-04-28T16:25:05Z
Oscillations of Thick Accretion Discs Around Black Holes - II,"We present a numerical study of the global modes of oscillation of thick
accretion discs around black holes. We have previously studied the case of
constant distributions of specific angular momentum. In this second paper, we
investigate (i) how the size of the disc affects the oscillation
eigenfrequencies, and (ii) the effect of power-law distributions of angular
momentum on the oscillations. In particular, we compare the oscillations of the
disc with the epicyclic eigenfrequencies of a test particle with different
angular momentum distributions orbiting around the central object. We find that
there is a frequency shift away from the epicyclic eigenfrequency of the test
particle to lower values as the size of the tori is increased. We have also
studied the response of a thick accretion disc to a localized external
perturbation using non constant specific angular momentum distributions within
the disc. We find that in this case it is also possible (as reported previously
for constant angular momentum distributions) to efficiently excite internal
modes of oscillation. In fact we show here that the local perturbations excite
global oscillations (acoustic p modes) closely related to the epicyclic
oscillations of test particles. Our results are particularly relevant in the
context of low mass X-ray binaries and microquasars, and the high frequency
Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) observed in them. Our computations make use
of a Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code in azimuthal symmetry, and use a
gravitational potential that mimics the effects of strong gravity.",2005-05-21T21:11:01Z
Dissipationless Merging and the Assembly of Central Galaxies,"We reanalyze the galaxy-mass correlation function measured by the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey to obtain host dark matter halo masses at galaxy and galaxy
group scales. We extend the data to galaxy clusters in the 2MASS catalog and
study the relation between central galaxy luminosity and halo mass. While the
central galaxy luminosity scales as ~M^{0.7-0.8} at low masses, the relation
flattens to ~M^{<0.3} above ~4x10^{13} M_sun. The total luminosity of galaxies
in the halo, however, continues to grow as a power-law ~M^{0.8-0.9}. Starting
from the hypothesis that the central galaxies grow by merging (""galactic
cannibalism""), we develop a simple model for the evolution of their
luminosities as a consequence of the accretion of satellite galaxies. The
luminosity-mass relation flattens when the time scale on which dynamical
friction induces orbital decay in the satellite galaxies exceeds the age of the
dark matter halo. Then, the growth of the central galaxy is suppressed as it
can cannibalize only the rare, massive satellite galaxies. The model takes the
dependence of the total luminosity of galaxies in a halo on its mass and the
global galaxy luminosity function as input, and reproduces the observed central
galaxy luminosity-mass relation over three decades in halo mass,
(10^{12}-10^{15}) M_sun.
  The success of the model suggests that gas cooling and subsequent star
formation did not play an important role in the final assembly of central
galaxies from sub-L_star precursors.",2005-03-29T05:32:03Z
"On the Meaning and Inapplicability of the Zeldovich Relations of
  Magnetohydrodynamics","Considering a plasma with an initially weak large scale field subject to
nonhelical turbulent stirring, Zeldovich (1957), for two-dimensions, followed
by others for three dimensions, and Zeldovich et al. (1983) have presented
formulae of the form $<b^2>=f(R_M){Bbar}^2$. Such ``Zeldovich relations'' have
sometimes been interpreted to provide steady-state relations between the energy
associated with the fluctuating magnetic field and that associated with a large
scale or mean field multiplied by a function $f$ that depends on spatial
dimension and a magnetic Reynolds number $R_M$. Here we dissect the origin of
these relations and pinpoint pitfalls that show why they are inapplicable to
realistic, dynamical MHD turbulence and that they disagree with many numerical
simulations. For 2-D, we show that when the total magnetic field is determined
by a vector potential, the standard Zeldovich relation applies only
transiently, characterizing a maximum possible value that the field energy can
reach before necessarily decaying. in relation to a seed value $Bbar$. In 3-D,
we show that the standard Zeldovich relations are derived by balancing
subdominant terms. In contrast, balancing the dominant terms shows that the
fluctuating field can grow to a value independent of $R_M$ and the initially
imposed $Bbar$, as seen in numerical simulations. We also emphasize that these
Zeldovich relations of nonhelical turbulence imply nothing about the amount
mean field growth in a helical dynamo. In short, by re-analyzing the origin of
the Zeldovich relations, we highlight that they are inapplicable to realistic
steady-states of large $R_M$ MHD turbulence.",2005-04-22T18:43:15Z
"The effective temperature scale of FGK stars. II. Teff : color : [Fe/H]
  calibrations","We present up-to-date metallicity-dependent temperature vs. color
calibrations for main sequence and giant stars based on temperatures derived
with the infrared flux method (IRFM). Seventeen colors in the following
photometric systems: UBV, uvby, Vilnius, Geneva, RI(Cousins), DDO,
Hipparcos-Tycho, and 2MASS, have been calibrated. The spectral types covered
range from F0 to K5 (7000 K<Teff<4000 K) with some relations extending below
4000 K or up to 8000 K. Most of the calibrations are valid in the metallicity
range -3.5<[Fe/H]<0.4, although some of them extend to as low as [Fe/H]=-4.0.
All fits to the data have been performed with more than 100 stars; standard
deviations range from 30 K to 120 K. Fits were carefully performed and
corrected to eliminate the small systematic errors introduced by the
calibration formulae. Tables of colors as a function of Teff and [Fe/H] are

"RR Lyrae search and stellar populations study in Canis Major:
  Preliminary Results","We present preliminary results of a RR Lyrae star search and stellar
populations study performed in the Canis Major overdensity, spanning an area of
8.35sq deg. The observations were made in R and V bands, with the QUEST camera

further observations obtained at the 1.0 and 1.3m telescopes of the SMARTS

The influence of non-uniform reionization on the CMB,"We investigate the impact of spatial variations in the ionized fraction
during reionization on temperature anisotropies in the CMB. We combine
simulations of large scale structure to describe the underlying density field
with an analytic model based on extended Press-Schechter theory to track the
reionization process. We find that the power spectrum of the induced CMB
anisotropies depends sensitively on the character of the reionization epoch.
Models that differ in the extent of the ""patchy phase"" could be distinguished
by future experiments such as the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the
South Pole Telescope (SPT). In our models, the patchy signal peaks at $l\simeq
2000$, where it can be four times larger than the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
(kSZ)/Ostriker-Vishniac (OV) signal ($\Delta T_{\rm tot} \simeq 2.6 \mu K$). On
scales beyond $l \simeq 4000$ the total Doppler signal is dominated by kSZ/OV,
but the patchy signal can contribute up to 30% to the power spectrum. The
effect of patchy reionization is largest on scales where the primordial CMB
anisotropies dominate. Ignoring this contribution could lead to significant
biases in the determination of cosmological parameters derived from CMB

"Low-Luminosity AGN as analogues of Galactic Black Holes in the low/hard
  state: Evidence from X-ray timing of NGC 4258","We present a broadband power spectral density function (PSD) measured from
extensive RXTE monitoring data of the low-luminosity AGN NGC 4258, which has an
accurate, maser-determined black hole mass of 3.9+/-0.1 * 10^7 solar masses. We
constrain the PSD break timescale to be greater than 4.5 d at >90% confidence,
which appears to rule out the possibility that NGC 4258 is an analogue of black
hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) in the high/soft state. In this sense, the PSD of
NGC 4258 is different to those of some more-luminous Seyferts, which appear
similar to the PSDs of high/soft state X-ray binaries. This result supports
previous analogies between LLAGN and X-ray binaries in the low/hard state based
on spectral energy distributions, indicating that the AGN/BHXRB analogy is
valid across a broad range of accretion rates.",2005-04-06T15:49:10Z
"The Liverpool Telescope Automatic Pipeline for Real-time GRB Afterglow
  Detection","The 2-m robotic Liverpool Telescope (LT) is ideally suited to the rapid
follow-up of unpredictable and transient events such as GRBs. Our GRB follow-up
strategy is designed to identify optical/IR counterparts in real time; it
involves the automatic triggering of initial observations, on receipt of an
alert from Gamma Ray Observatories HETE-2, INTEGRAL and Swift, followed by
automated data reduction, analysis, OT identification and subsequent observing
mode choice. The lack of human intervention in this process requires robustness
at all stages of the procedure. Here we describe the telescope, its
instrumentation and GRB pipeline.",2005-02-24T13:32:23Z
"Constraints on the metagalactic hydrogen ionization rate from the
  Lyman-alpha forest opacity","Understanding the sources responsible for reionizing the Universe is a key
goal of observational cosmology. A discrepancy has existed between the
metagalactic hydrogen ionization rate, Gamma_HI, predicted by early
hydrodynamical simulations of the Lyman-alpha forest if scaled to appropriate
assumptions for the IGM temperature, when compared to values predicted from the
proximity effect. We present new estimates for Gamma_HI in the redshift range
2<z<4 based on hydrodynamical simulations of the Lyman-alpha forest opacity.
Within the current concordance cosmology, and assuming updated QSO emissivity
rates, a substantial contribution to the UV background from young star-forming
galaxies appears to be required over the entire redshift range. Our results are
consistent with lower-end estimates from the proximity effect. It is also found
that the errors on the ionization rate are dominated by uncertainties in the
thermal state of the intergalactic medium and the r.m.s fluctuation amplitude
at the Jeans scale.",2005-04-20T12:00:25Z
Orbital Parameters of the Microquasar LSI +61 303,"New optical spectroscopy of the HMXB microquasar LSI +61 303 is presented.
Eccentric orbital fits to our radial velocity measurements yield updated
orbital parameters in good agreement with previous work. Our orbital solution
indicates that the periastron passage occurs at radio phase 0.23 and the
X-ray/radio outbursts are triggered 2.5--4 days after the compact star passage.
The spectrum of the optical star is consistent with a B0 V spectral type and
contributes ~65 percent of the total light, the remaining due to emission by a
circumstellar disc. We also measure the projected rotational velocity to be v
sin i = 113 km/s.",2005-04-14T16:20:26Z
Underground Searches for Cold Relics of the Early Universe,"We have strong evidence on all cosmic scales, from galaxies to the largest
structures ever observed, that there is more matter in the universe than we can
see. Galaxies and clusters would fly apart unless they would be held together
by material which we call dark, because it does not shine in photons. Although
the amount of dark matter and its distribution are fairly well established, we
are clueless regarding its composition. Leading candidates are Weakly
Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which are 'cold' thermal relics of the
Big Bang, ie moving non-relativistically at the time of structure formation.
These particles can be detected via their interaction with nuclei in
deep-underground, low-background detectors. Experiments dedicated to observe
WIMP interactions for the first time reach sensitivities allowing to probe the
parameter space predicted by supersymmetric theories of particle physics.
Current results of high sensitivity direct detection experiments are discussed
and the most promising projects of the future are presented. If a stable new
particle exists at the weak scale, it seems likely to expect a discovery within
this decade.",2005-03-24T17:08:50Z
The Amplitude of Dark Energy Perturbations,"We propose a model which produces dark energy perturbations large enough to
explain the lack of power seen at the quadrupole scale in the cosmic microwave
background. If the dark energy is frozen from horizon exit during inflation
until dark energy domination, then it is not possible to have perturbations in
the dark energy which are large enough. We propose using a tachyonic
amplification mechanism to overcome this. The dark energy is taken to be a
complex scalar field, where the radial field has a Mexican hat potential.
During inflation, the radial component is trapped near the maximum of its
potential. At the end of inflation, it rolls down to the minimum. The dark
energy today is taken to be a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson. The perturbations
generated during inflation are amplified by the rolling of the radial field. We
also examine the use of the variable decay mechanism in order to generate an
anti-correlation between the dark energy perturbations and the curvature
perturbation. We show that using this mechanism then constrains the properties
of the dark energy and its evolution from redshift one until today.",2005-04-06T00:11:31Z
"A simple parameterization of the consequences of deleptonization for
  simulations of stellar core collapse","A simple and computationally efficient parameterization of the
deleptonization, the entropy changes, and the neutrino stress is presented for
numerical simulations of stellar core collapse. The parameterization of the
neutrino physics is based on a bounce profile of the electron fraction as it
results from state-of-the-art collapse simulations with multi-group Boltzmann
neutrino transport in spherical symmetry. Two additional parameters include an
average neutrino escape energy and a neutrino trapping density. The
parameterized simulations reproduce the consequences of the delicate neutrino
thermalization/diffusion process during the collapse phase and provide a by far
more realistic alternative to the adiabatic approximation, which has often been
used in the investigation of the emission of gravitational waves, of
multi-dimensional general relativistic effects, of the evolution of magnetic
fields, or even of the nucleosynthesis in simulations of core collapse and
bounce. For supernova codes that are specifically designed for the postbounce
phase, the parameterization builds a convenient bridge between the point where
the applicability of a stellar evolution code ends and the point where the
postbounce evolution begins.",2005-04-04T15:44:42Z
"Predicting Single-Temperature Fit to Multi-Component Thermal Plasma
  Spectra","Observed X-ray spectra of hot gas in clusters, groups, and individual
galaxies are commonly fit with a single-temperature thermal plasma model even
though the beam may contain emission from components with different
temperatures. Recently, Mazzotta et al. pointed out that thus derived T_spec
can be significantly different from commonly used definitions of average
temperature, such as emission- or emission measure-weighted T, and found an
analytic expression for predicting T_spec for a mixture of plasma spectra with
relatively hot temperatures (T>3 keV). In this Paper, we propose an algorithm
which can accurately predict T_spec in a much wider range of temperatures
(T>0.5 keV), and for essentially arbitrary abundance of heavy elements. This
algorithm can be applied in the deprojection analysis of objects with the
temperature and metallicity gradients, for correction of the PSF effects, for
consistent comparison of numerical simulations of galaxy clusters and groups
with the X-ray observations, and for estimating how emission from undetected
components can bias the global X-ray spectral analysis.",2005-04-05T07:16:58Z
"The Magnetic Field in Galaxies, Galaxy Clusters, and the InterGalactic
  Space","Magnetic fields of debated origin appear to permeate the Universe on all
large scales. There is mounting evidence that supernovae produce not only
roughly spherical ejecta and winds, but also highly relativistic jets of
ordinary matter. These jets, which travel long distances, slow down by
accelerating the matter encountered on their path to cosmic-ray energies. We
show that, if the turbulent motions induced by the winds and the cosmic rays
generate magnetic fields in rough energy equipartition, the predicted
magnetic-field strengths coincide with the ones observed not only in galaxies
(5 $\mu$G in the Milky Way) but also in galaxy clusters (6 $\mu$G in Coma). The
prediction for the intergalactic (or inter-cluster) field is 50 nG.",2005-04-21T17:52:53Z
"On the relation between circular velocity and central velocity
  dispersion in high and low surface brightness galaxies","In order to investigate the correlation between the circular velocity Vc and
the central velocity dispersion of the spheroidal component sigma_c, we
analyzed these quantities for a sample of 40 high surface brightness disc
galaxies (hereafter HSB), 8 giant low surface brightness spiral galaxies
(hereafter LSB), and 24 elliptical galaxies characterized by flat rotation
curves. We find that the Vc-sigma_c relation is descri ed by a linear law out
to velocity dispersions as low as sigma_c~50km/s, while in previous works a
power law was adopted for galaxies with sigma_c>80k/ms.
  Elliptical galaxies with Vc based on dynamical models or directly derived
from the HI rotation curves follow the same relation as the HSB galaxies in the
Vc-sigma_c plane. On the contrary, the LSB galaxies follow a different
relation, since most of them show either higher Vc (or lower sigma_c) with
respect to the HSB galaxies. This argues against the relevance of baryon
collapse in the radial density profile of the dark matter haloes of LSB
galaxies. (abridged)",2005-03-30T11:55:00Z

"Exploring Halo Substructure with Giant Stars. VI. Extended Distributions
  of Giant Stars Around the Carina Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy -- How Reliable Are
  They?","The question of the existence of active tidal disruption around various dSph
galaxies remains controversial. That debate often centers on the nature (bound
vs. unbound) of extended populations of stars. However, the more fundamental
issue of the very existence of the extended populations is still contentious.
We present an evaluation of the debate centering on one particular dSph,
Carina, for which claims both for and against the existence of stars beyond the
King radius have been made. Our review includes an examination of all previous
studies bearing on the Carina radial profile and shows that the survey method
which achieves the highest detected dSph signal-to-background in the outer
parts of the galaxy is the Washington M, T2 + DDO51 (MTD) filter approach from
Paper II in this series. We then address statistical methods used to evaluate
the reliability of MTD surveys in the presence of photometric errors and for
which a new, a posteriori statistical analysis methodology is provided.
Finally, these statistical methods are tested by new spectroscopy of stars in
the MTD-selected Carina candidate sample. Of 74 candidate giants with follow-up
spectroscopy, the MTD technique identified 61 new Carina members, including 8
stars outside the King radius. From a sample of 29 stars not initially
identified as candidate Carina giants but that lie just outside of our
selection criteria, 12 have radial velocities consistent with membership,
including 5 extratidal stars. Carina is shown to have an extended population of
giant stars extending to a major axis radius of 40' (1.44x the nominal King
radius).",2005-03-29T19:55:12Z
"Statistical Analysis of Galaxy Surveys-II. The 3-point galaxy
  correlation function measured from the 2dFGRS","We present new results for the 3-point correlation function, \zeta, measured
as a function of scale, luminosity and colour from the final version of the
two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dFGRS). The reduced three point
correlation function, Q_3 is estimated for different triangle shapes and sizes,
employing a full covariance analysis. The form of Q_3 is consistent with the
expectations for the \Lambda-cold dark matter model, confirming that the
primary influence shaping the distribution of galaxies is gravitational
instability acting on Gaussian primordial fluctuations. However, we find a
clear offset in amplitude between Q_3 for galaxies and the predictions for the
dark matter. We are able to rule out the scenario in which galaxies are
unbiased tracers of the mass at the 9-sigma level. On weakly non-linear scales,
we can interpret our results in terms of galaxy bias parameters. We find a
linear bias term that is consistent with unity, b_1 = 0.93^{+0.10}_{-0.08} and
a quadratic bias c_2 = b_2 /b_1 = -0.34^{+0.11}_{-0.08}. This is the first
significant detection of a non-zero quadratic bias, indicating a small but
important non-gravitational contribution to the three point function. Our
estimate of the linear bias from the three point function is independent of the
normalisation of underlying density fluctuations, so we can combine this with
the measurement of the power spectrum of 2dFGRS galaxies to constrain the
amplitude of matter fluctuations. We find that the rms linear theory variance
in spheres of radius 8Mpc/h is \sigma_8 = 0.88^{+0.12}_{-0.10}, providing an
independent confirmation of values derived from other techniques. On non-linear
scales, where \xi>1, we find that Q_3 has a strong dependence on scale, colour
and luminosity.",2005-06-12T21:38:42Z
GMOS-IFU Spectroscopy of 167-317 (LV2) Proplyd in Orion,"We present high spatial resolution spectroscopic observations of the proplyd
167-317 (LV2) near the Trapezium cluster in the Orion nebula, obtained during
the System Verification run of the Gemini Multi Object Spectrograph (GMOS)
Integral Field Unit (IFU) at the Gemini South Observatory. We have detected 38
forbidden and permitted emission lines associated with the proplyd and its
redshifted jet. We have been able to detect three velocity components in the
profiles of some of these lines: a peak with a 28-33 km/s systemic velocity
that is associated with the photoevaporated proplyd flow, a highly redshifted
component associated with a previously reported jet (which has receding
velocities of about 80-120 km/s with respect to the systemic velocity and is
spatially distributed to the southeast of the proplyd) and a less obvious,
approaching structure, which may possibly be associated with a faint
counter-jet with systemic velocity of (-75 +/- 15) km/s. We find evidences that
the redshifted jet has a variable velocity, with slow fluctuations as a
function of the distance from the proplyd. We present several background
subtracted, spatially distributed emission line maps and we use this
information to obtain the dynamical characteristics over the observed field.
Using a simple model and with the extinction corrected Halpha fluxes, we
estimate the mass loss rate for both the proplyd photoevaporated flow and the
redshifted microjet, obtaining (6.2 +/- 0.6) x 10^{-7} M_sun/year and (2.0 +/-
0.7) x 10^{-8} M_sun/year, respectively.",2005-06-14T16:24:16Z
A dwarf galaxy with a giant HI disk,"We present Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) HI 21cm images of a nearby
dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 3741 (M_B ~ -13.13 mag) which show it to have a gas
disk that extends to ~ 8.3 times its Holmberg radius. This makes it probably
the most extended gas disk known. Our observations allow us to derive the
rotation curve (which is flat in the outer regions) out to ~ 38 optical scale
lengths. NGC 3741 has a dynamical mass to light ratio of ~ 107 and is one of
the ``darkest'' irregular galaxies known. However, the bulk of the baryonic
mass in NGC 3741 is in the form of gas and the ratio of the dynamic mass to the
baryonic mass (~ 8), falls within the range that is typical for galaxies. Thus
the dark matter halo of NGC 3741 has acquired its fair share of baryons, but
for some reason, these baryons have been unable to collapse to form stars. A
comparison of NGC 3741's dark halo properties with those of a sample of
galaxies with well measured rotation curves suggests that if one has to
reconcile the observations with the expectation that low mass galaxies suffer
fractionally greater baryon loss then baryon loss from halos occurs in such a
way that, in the net, the remaining baryons occupy a fractionally smaller
volume of the total halo.",2005-02-16T04:15:43Z
"Doppler imaging of Speedy Mic using the VLT, Fast spot evolution on a
  young K-dwarf star","We study the short-term evolution of starspots on the ultrafast-rotating star
HD197890 (""Speedy Mic"" = BO Mic, K 0-2V, P_rot = 0.380 d) based on two Doppler
images taken about 13 stellar rotations apart. Each image is based on spectra
densely sampling a single stellar rotation. The images were reconstructed by
our Doppler imaging code CLDI (Clean-like Doppler imaging) from line profiles
extracted by spectrum deconvolution. Our Doppler images constructed from two
independent wavelength ranges agree well on scales down to 10 degrees on the
stellar surface. In conjunction with nearly parallel V-band photometry our
observations reveal a significant evolution of the spot pattern during as
little as two stellar rotations. We suggest that such a fast spot evolution
demands care when constructing Doppler images of highly active stars based on
spectral time series extending over several stellar rotations. The fast
intrinsic spot evolution on BO Mic impedes the determination of a surface
differential rotation; in agreement with earlier results by other authors we
determine an upper limit of |alpha| < 0.004 +- 0.002.",2005-04-05T13:03:29Z
"An Analysis of the Shapes of Ultraviolet Extinction Curves. IV.
  Extinction without Standards","We present a new method for deriving UV-through-IR extinction curves, based
on the use of stellar atmosphere models to provide estimates of the intrinsic
(i.e., unreddened) stellar spectral energy distributions (SEDs), rather than
unreddened (or lightly reddened) standard stars. We show that this
``extinction-without-standards'' technique greatly increases the accuracy of
the derived extinction curves and allows realistic estimations of the
uncertainties. An additional benefit of the technique is that it simultaneously
determines the fundamental properties of the reddened stars themselves, making
the procedure valuable for both stellar and interstellar studies. We
demonstrate how the extinction-without-standards curves make it possible to: 1)
study the uniformity of extinction in localized spatial regions with
unprecedented precision; 2) determine the relationships between different
aspects of curve morphology; 3) produce high quality extinction curves from low
color excess sightlines; and 4) derive reliable extinction curves for mid-late
B stars, thereby increasing spatial coverage and allowing the study of
extinction in open clusters and associations dominated by such stars. The
application of this technique to the available database of UV-through-IR SEDs,
and to future observations, will provide valuable constraints on the nature of
interstellar grains and on the processes which modify them, and will enhance
our ability to remove the multi-wavelength effects of extinction from
astronomical energy distributions.",2005-06-17T15:21:28Z
Finding outlier light-curves in catalogs of periodic variable stars,"We present a methodology to discover outliers in catalogs of periodic
light-curves. We use cross-correlation as measure of ``similarity'' between two
individual light-curves and then classify light-curves with lowest average
``similarity'' as outliers. We performed the analysis on catalogs of variable
stars of known type from the MACHO and OGLE projects and established that our
method correctly identifies light-curves that do not belong to those catalogs
as outliers. We show how our method can scale to large datasets that will be
available in the near future such as those anticipated from Pan-STARRS and
LSST.",2005-05-24T20:06:42Z
Can a photometric redshift code reliably determine dust extinction?,"Photometric redshifts can be routinely obtained to accuracies of better than
0.1 in Delta(z)/(1+z). However, the issue of dust extinction is one that has
still not been well quantified. In this paper the success of two
template-fitting photometric redshift codes (IMPZ and HYPERZ) at reliably
returning Av in addition to redshift is explored. New data on the CNOC2
spectroscopic sample of 0.2<z<0.7 galaxies are presented. These data allow us
to estimate Av values from the observed Balmer decrements. We also investigate
whether the empirical value of gamma=0.44, the ratio between gas- and star-
derived extinction, as determined by Calzetti (2001), is necessarily the best
value for this sample.
  When comparing the two codes to the Balmer-derived Av, a correlation between
the photometrically derived Av, Phot-Av, and the Balmer-Av is found. The
correlation is improved when the empirical value of gamma=0.44 is allowed to
vary. From least-squares-fitting the minimum in the reduced chi^2 distribution
is found for gamma~0.25 +/- 0.2. For the sample of galaxies here, the factor of
two difference in covering factor implied by the Calzetti ratio is found to be
plausible. The CNOC2 galaxies with detected Balmer lines have some preference
for an increased covering factor difference, which would perhaps imply they are
undergoing more rapid, `bursty' star formation than the galaxies Calzetti used
in her derivation.",2005-05-05T20:00:16Z
Relativistic Aberration Effect in Astrophysics and Cosmology,"Relativistic aberration influences apparent luminosities of objects moving
with relativistic relative velocities. The superluminosity or dimming of
incoming or receding jets ejected from Active Galactic Nuclei is believed to be
the manifestation of the effect. Redshifted cosmological objects, such as
high-z galaxies and supernovae in high-z galaxies, are also subjected to
luminosity dimming due to relativistic aberration, although the correcting
terms encompassing spectral redshift and time dilation are used to scale the
observed magnitudes in the restframe template. The Universe's expansion results
in elongation of distances to the objects from the moment of emission to the
present time related to the z = 0 local space; this elongation is equal to the
apparent increase of the distance from the apparent size to the restframe
distance in the theory of special relativity due to the effect of relativistic
aberration. Contrary to the standard Big Bang model with stationary space, the
effect of relativistic aberration zeroes in the expending space model; if local
spaces and local objects expand together with the Universe, the luminosity
distances to high-redshifted objects appear to be smaller then in the Big Bang
model.",2005-05-10T18:09:33Z
"QPOs and firehose instabilities in neutron star magnetospheres in
  accreting systems","We show that the interaction of an accretion disk with the magnetosphere of a
neutron star can excite resonant shear Alfven waves with Hz-kHz frequencies in
a region of enhanced density gradients. This is the the region where accretion
material flows along the magnetic field lines in the magnetosphere. We argue
that due to the pressure anisotropy produced by the plasma flow, firehose
instabilities are likely to occur. Furthermore, for a dipolar field topology,
we show that a new instability develops due to both magnetic field curvature
and the plasma flow.",2005-06-04T06:05:56Z
A dearth of planetary transits in the direction of NGC 6940,"We present results of our survey for planetary transits in the field of NGC
6940. We think nearly all of our observed stars are field stars. We have
obtained high precision (3-10 millimags at the bright end) photometric
observations of 50,000 stars spanning 18 nights in an attempt to identify low
amplitude and short period transit events. We have used a matched filter
analysis to identify 14 stars that show multiple events, and four stars that
show single transits. Of these 18 candidates, we have identified two that
should be further researched. However, none of the candidates are convincing

Varying Electromagnetic Coupling and Primordial Magnetic Fields,"We study the effect of variations of the electromagnetic coupling on the
process of generation of primordial magnetic fields. We find that only through
a significant growth of the electromagnetic coupling minimum seed fields can be
produced. We also show that, if through some process in the early Universe the
photon acquires a mass that leads, thanks to inflation, to the generation of
primordial magnetic fields, then the influence of variations of the
electromagnetic coupling amounts essentially to the results due to the photon
effective mass alone.",2005-04-08T17:01:27Z
"Three routes to jet collimation by the Balbus-Hawley magnetorotational
  instability","Three completely different lines of work have recently led to the conclusion
that the magnetorotational instability (MRI) may create a hoop-stress that
collimates jets. One argument is based upon consideration that
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, in general, and turbulence driven by the MRI,
in particular, is more nearly viscoelastic than it is viscous. Another argument
is based upon the dispersion relation for the MRI in the context of 1D
simulations of core collapse. Yet a third argument rests in the results of
direct numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations of collapsars and thick
accretion flows. I elaborate on my previous work regarding the first argument
above and I briefly discuss how these three sets of results are all related. I
also discuss the different roles played by the magnetic tension and the
magnetic pressure within the context of this work. I point out that this leads
to consideration of the normal stress difference between the hoop stress and
the radial stress, in preference to a focus on just the hoop stress itself.
Additionally, I argue that simulations of thick accretion flows and collapsars
are not self-consistent if they include a phenomenological model for an
MRI-induced viscous stress but disregard these other MRI-induced stress
components. I comment briefly on the RHESSI observation of polarization in the
gamma-ray burst GRB0212206. I argue that this polarization is consistent with a
tangled field, and does not require a large-scale organized field. Finally I
suggest that the role of magnetic fields in creating jets, as described here,
should be understood not to work within the confines of magnetocentrifugal
models of jets, but rather as an alternative to them.",2005-06-09T17:10:57Z
"Metallicity of M dwarfs I. A photometric calibration and impact on the
  mass-luminosity relation at the bottom of the main sequence","We obtained high resolution ELODIE and CORALIE spectra for both components of
20 wide visual binaries composed of an F-, G- or K-dwarf primary and an M-dwarf
secondary. We analyse the well understood spectra of the primaries to determine
metallicities ([Fe/H]) for these 20 systems, and hence for their M dwarf
components. We pool these metallicities with determinations from the literature
to obtain a precise (+- 0.2 dex) photometric calibration of M dwarf
metallicities. This calibration represents a breakthrough in a field where
discussions have had to remain largely qualitative, and it helps us demonstrate
that metallicity explains most of the large dispersion in the empirical V-band
mass-luminosity relation. We examine the metallicity of the two known M-dwarf
planet-host stars, Gl 876 (+0.02 dex) and Gl 436 (-0.03 dex), in the context of
preferential planet formation around metal-rich stars. We finally determine the
metallicity of the 47 brightest single M dwarfs in a volume limited sample, and
compare the metallicity distributions of solar-type and M-dwarf stars in the
solar neighbourhood.",2005-03-11T13:24:50Z
The Evolution of the M-sigma Relation,"(Abridged) We examine the evolution of the black hole mass - stellar velocity
dispersion (M-sigma) relation over cosmic time using simulations of galaxy
mergers that include feedback from supermassive black hole growth. We consider
mergers of galaxies varying the properties of the progenitors to match those
expected at redshifts z=0-6. We find that the slope of the resulting M-sigma
relation is the same at all redshifts considered. For the same feedback
efficiency that reproduces the observed amplitude of the M-sigma relation at
z=0, there is a weak redshift-dependence to the normalization that results from
an increasing velocity dispersion for a given galactic stellar mass. We develop
a formalism to connect redshift evolution in the M-sigma relation to the
scatter in the local relation at z=0. We show that the scatter in the local
relation places severe constraints on the redshift evolution of both the
normalization and slope of the M-sigma relation. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that cosmic downsizing introduces a black hole mass-dependent dispersion in the
M-sigma relation and that the skewness of the distribution about the locally
observed M-sigma relation is sensitive to redshift evolution in the
normalization and slope. In principle, these various diagnostics provide a
method for differentiating between theories for producing the M-sigma relation.
In agreement with existing constraints, our simulations imply that hierarchical
structure formation should produce the relation with small intrinsic scatter.",2005-06-01T22:22:43Z
"Extragalactic Globular Clusters: Old Spectroscopic Ages and New Views on
  Their Formation","We present the results of a meta-analysis of Keck spectra of extragalactic
globular clusters (GCs) in a sample of eight galaxies, ranging from dwarfs to
massive ellipticals. We infer ages for the metal-poor and metal-rich GCs in
these galaxies through comparisons to Galactic GCs. Both subpopulations appear
to be no younger than their Galactic counterparts, with ages ~> 10 Gyr. This is
the largest sample of galaxies for which ages have been constrained
spectroscopically. Our results support the formation of most GCs in massive
galaxies at high redshift. We propose a scenario for the formation of GC
subpopulations that synthesizes aspects of both accretion and in situ
approaches in the context of galaxy formation through hierarchical merging.",2005-06-13T20:00:01Z
"Three-dimensional modeling of Type Ia supernovae - The power of late
  time spectra","Late time synthetic spectra of Type Ia supernovae, based on three-dimensional
deflagration models, are presented. We mainly focus on one
model,""c3_3d_256_10s"", for which the hydrodynamics (Roepke 2005) and
nucleosynthesis (Travaglio et al. 2004) was calculated up to the homologous
phase of the explosion. Other models with different ignition conditions and
different resolution are also briefly discussed. The synthetic spectra are
compared to observed late time spectra. We find that while the model spectra
after 300 to 500 days show a good agreement with the observed Fe II-III
features, they also show too strong O I and C I lines compared to the observed
late time spectra. The oxygen and carbon emission originates from the
low-velocity unburned material in the central regions of these models. To get
agreement between the models and observations we find that only a small mass of
unburned material may be left in the center after the explosion. This may be a
problem for pure deflagration models, although improved initial conditions, as
well as higher resolution decrease the discrepancy. The relative intensity from
the different ionization stages of iron is sensitive to the density of the
emitting iron-rich material. We find that clumping, with the presence of low
density regions, is needed to reproduce the observed iron emission, especially
in the range between 4000 and 6000 AA. Both temperature and ionization depend
sensitively on density, abundances and radioactive content. This work therefore
illustrates the importance of including the inhomogeneous nature of realistic
three-dimensional explosion models. We briefly discuss the implications of the
spectral modeling for the nature of the explosion.",2005-04-14T10:05:52Z
"Early Re-brightenings in GRB Afterglows as Signatures of Low-to-High
  Density Boundary","The association of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with star forming regions and
the idea of massive stars as progenitors of GRBs are widely accepted. Because
of their short lifetimes, it is very likely that massive stars are still
embedded in dense molecular clouds when they give birth to GRBs. Stellar winds
from GRB progenitors can create low-density bubbles with sizes and densities
strongly depending on the initial ambient density. A boundary between the
bubble and the dense molecular cloud must exist with the density at the
boundary increasing from that of the bubble to that of the outer cloud. We have
calculated the lightcurves of the afterglows in such environments with three
regions: the stellar wind region, the boundary, and the molecular cloud. We
show that the interaction between the cylindrical jet and the density boundary
can result in a re-brightening of the afterglow occurring as early as ~1 day
after the GRB. We compare our models with the optical afterglows of GRB970508,
GRB000301C, and GRB030226. We find that the values of our model parameters,
including the radius of the wind bubble, the densities in the bubble and in the
outer molecular cloud are within typical ranges.",2005-04-01T17:31:13Z
FUSE Observations of RX J0513.9-6951,"FUSE observations were obtained in July 2003 during 1.2 cycles of the
0.76-day binary orbit of RX J0513.9-6951. Radial velocity measurements of the
broad O VI emission profile show a semiamplitude of K~26 km/sec, which is much
smaller than the value of 117 km/sec measured from 2001 FUSE data. Narrow O VI
emissions show no measurable velocity variation. The mean velocity of the broad
O VI emission is red-shifted by ~500 km/sec with respect to both the systemic
and narrow emission-line velocities. Spectral difference plots show
phase-related changes in the broad emission profile. Other phase-related
changes such as line and continuum variations are also smaller than in the 2001
spectra. We describe a moving broad absorption feature near 1020A as possible O
VI outflow associated with a precessing jet. We discuss the implications for
the stellar masses if the 2003 broad O VI velocities outline the compact star's
orbital motion.",2005-03-18T16:51:47Z
"An Analysis of Fundamental Waffle Mode in Early AEOS Adaptive Optics
  Images","Adaptive optics (AO) systems have significantly improved astronomical imaging
capabilities over the last decade, and are revolutionizing the kinds of science
possible with 4-5m class ground-based telescopes. A thorough understanding of
AO system performance at the telescope can enable new frontiers of science as
observations push AO systems to their performance limits. We look at recent
advances with wave front reconstruction (WFR) on the Advanced Electro-Optical
System (AEOS) 3.6 m telescope to show how progress made in improving WFR can be
measured directly in improved science images. We describe how a ""waffle mode""
wave front error (which is not sensed by a Fried geometry Shack-Hartmann wave
front sensor) affects the AO point-spread function (PSF). We model details of
AEOS AO to simulate a PSF which matches the actual AO PSF in the I-band, and
show that while the older observed AEOS PSF contained several times more waffle
error than expected, improved WFR techniques noticeably improve AEOS AO
performance. We estimate the impact of these improved WFRs on H-band imaging at
AEOS, chosen based on the optimization of the Lyot Project near-infrared
coronagraph at this bandpass.",2005-05-10T14:46:56Z
On the Sr I 4607 A Hanle depolarization signals in the quiet Sun,"The Hanle depolarization signals of Sr 4607 A have been used to estimate the
unsigned magnetic flux and magnetic energy existing in the quiet Sun
photosphere. However, the Sr 4607 A Hanle signals are not sensitive to the
unsigned flux and energy. They only bear information on the fraction of
photosphere occupied by magnetic field strengths smaller than the Hanle
saturation, which do not contribute to the unsigned flux and energy. We deduce
an approximate expression for the relationship between magnetic fill factor and
Hanle signal. When applied to existing Hanle depolarization measurements, it
indicates that only 40% of the quiet Sun is filled by magnetic fields with a
strength smaller than 60 G. The remaining 60% of the surface has field
strengths above this limit. Such constraint will be needed to determine the
distribution of magnetic field strengths existing in the quiet Sun.",2005-04-15T08:37:11Z
Parameter Study of Star-Discs Encounters,"Interactions between disc-surrounded stars might play a vital role in the
formation of planetary systems. Here a first parameter study of the effects of
encounters on low-mass discs is presented. The dependence of the mass and
angular momentum transport on the periastron distance, the relative mass of the
encountering stars and eccentricity of the encounter is investigated in detail.
This is done for prograde and retrograde coplanar encounters as well as
non-coplanar encounters. For distant coplanar encounters our simulation results
agree with the analytical approximation of the angular momentum loss by
Ostriker(1994). However, for close or high-mass encounters, significant
differences to this approximation are found. This is especially so in the case
of retrograde encounters, where the analytical result predict no angular
momentum loss regardless of the periastron distance whereas the simulations
find up to ~ 20% loss for close encounters. For the non-coplanar case a more
complex dependency on the inclination between orbital path and disc plane is
found than for distant encounters. For the coplanar prograde case new fitting
formulae for the mass and angular momentum loss are obtained, which cover the
whole range from grazing to distant encounters. In addition, the final disc
size and the mass exchange between discs is examined, demonstrating that for
equal mass stars in encounters as close as 1.5 the disc radius, the disc size
only is reduced by approximately 10%.",2005-04-13T06:01:57Z
"Fast Edge Corrected Measurement of the Two-Point Correlation Function
  and the Power Spectrum","We present two related techniques to measure the two-point correlation
function and the power spectrum with edge correction in any spatial dimensions.
The underlying algorithm uses fast Fourier transforms for calculating the
two-point function with an heuristically weighted edge corrected estimator.
Once the correlation function is measured, we estimate the power spectrum via
numerical integration of the Hankel transform connecting the two. We introduce
an efficient numerical technique based on Gauss-Bessel-quadrature and double
exponential transformation. This, combined with our, or any similar, two-point
function estimator leads to a novel edge corrected estimator for power spectra.
The pair of techniques presented are the Euclidean analogs of those developed
and widely used in cosmic microwave background research for spherical maps.",2005-05-18T20:00:06Z
Stringy Dark Energy Model with Cold Dark Matter,"Cosmological consequences of adding the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) to the exactly
solvable stringy Dark Energy (DE) model are investigated. The model is
motivated by the consideration of our Universe as a slowly decaying D3-brane.
The decay of this D-brane is described in the String Field Theory framework.
Stability conditions of the exact solution with respect to small fluctuations
of the initial value of the CDM energy density are found. Solutions with large
initial value of the CDM energy density attracted by the exact solution without
CDM are constructed numerically. In contrast to the LambdaCDM model the Hubble
parameter in the model is not a monotonic function of time. For specific
initial data the DE state parameter w_{DE} is also not monotonic function of
time. For these cases there are two separate regions of time where w_{DE} being
less than -1 is close to -1.",2005-05-30T17:36:38Z
Particle Acceleration in Relativistic Flows,"A property common to several different astrophysical sources of high-energy
gamma-rays is the presence of bulk motion at relativistic speed. The intrinsic
spectra of the nonthermal radiating particles also show interesting
similarities, with a pronounced hardening towards lower energies. This suggests
two distinct acceleration mechanisms could be at work in these sources. At high
energies, the stochastic first-order Fermi process at shocks seems to provide a
reasonable explanation. I will briefly review the status of this mechanism
before discussing the possibility that, at lower energies, non-stochastic
acceleration in the induced electric field of a relativistic current sheet
plays a role.",2005-03-15T14:49:49Z
"Discovery of Rapid X-ray Oscillations in the Tail of the SGR 1806-20
  Hyperflare","We have discovered rapid Quasi Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) in RXTE/PCA
measurements of the pulsating tail of the 27th December 2004 giant flare of SGR
1806-20. QPOs at about 92.5Hz are detected in a 50s interval starting 170s
after the onset of the giant flare. These QPOs appear to be associated with
increased emission by a relatively hard unpulsed component and are seen only
over phases of the 7.56s spin period pulsations away from the main peak. QPOs
at about 18 and 30Hz are also detected, 200-300s after the onset of the giant
flare. This is the first time that QPOs are unambiguously detected in the flux
of a Soft Gamma-ray Repeater, or any other magnetar candidate. We interpret the
highest QPOs in terms of the coupling of toroidal seismic modes with Alfven
waves propagating along magnetospheric field lines. The lowest frequency QPO
might instead provide indirect evidence on the strength of the internal
magnetic field of the neutron star.",2005-05-12T13:30:30Z
C and N Abundances in Stars At the Base of the Red Giant Branch in M15,"We present an analysis of a large sample of moderate resolution Keck LRIS
spectra of subgiants and stars at the base of the RGB in M15, most within the
range 16.5 < V < 19.5 (1.2 < M_V < 4.2), with the goal of deriving C abundances
(from the G band of CH) and N abundances (from the NH band at 3360 A).
Star-to-star stochastic variations with significant range in both [C/Fe] and
[N/Fe] are found at all luminosities extending to the subgiants at M_V ~ +3.
The C and N abundances appear anti-correlated, as would be expected from the
CN-cycle processing of stellar material. Yet these M15 stars are considerably
fainter than the RGB bump, the point at which deep mixing is believed to set
in. On this basis, while the observed abundance pattern is consistent with
proton capture nucleosynthesis, we infer that the site of the reactions is
likely not within the present sample. The range of variation of the N
abundances is very large and the sum of C+N increases as C decreases. To
reproduce this requires the incorporation not only of CN but also of
ON-processed material. Combining our work with that of Trefzger et al (1983)
for the brighter giants in M15, we find strong evidence for additional
depletion of C among the most luminous giants. This presumably represents the
first dredge up (with enhanced deep mixing) expected for such luminous cluster
RGB stars in the course of normal stellar evolution as they cross the RGB bump.
We compare the behavior of these patterns for C and N in globular clusters
covering a wide range of metallicity and of current mass and discuss possible
scenarios to reproduce the observed behavior of these key elements. (abridged)",2005-05-12T17:07:35Z
"The SAURON project - IV. The mass-to-light ratio, the virial mass
  estimator and the fundamental plane of elliptical and lenticular galaxies","We investigate with unprecedented accuracy the correlations between the
dynamical mass-to-light ratio M/L and other global observables of E and S0
galaxies. We construct two-integral Jeans and three-integral Schwarzschild
dynamical models for a sample of 25 E/S0 galaxies with SAURON integral-field
stellar kinematics. We find a tight correlation of the form
(M/L)=(3.80+/-0.14)*(sigma/200 km/s)^(0.84+/-0.07) between the dynamical M/L
(in the I-band) and the luminosity-weighted second moment (sigma) of the
line-of-sight velocity-distribution within Re. The observed rms scatter in M/L
for our sample is 18%, while the inferred intrinsic scatter is ~13%. The
(M/L)-sigma relation can be included in the remarkable series of tight
correlations between sigma and other galaxy global observables. The comparison
of the observed correlations with the predictions of the Fundamental Plane
(FP), and with simple virial estimates, shows that the `tilt' of the FP of
early-type galaxies, is due to a real M/L variation, while structural and
orbital non-homology have a negligible effect. The virial mass is a reliable
estimator of the mass in the central regions of galaxies. The best-fitting
virial relation has the form (M/L)_vir=(5.0+/-0.1)*Re*sigma^2/(L*G). The
comparison of the dynamical M/L with the (M/L)_pop inferred from the analysis
of the stellar population, indicates a median dark matter fraction in
early-type galaxies of ~30% of the total mass inside one Re. (Abridged)",2005-05-03T17:03:25Z
The SDSS View of the Palomar-Green Bright Quasar Survey,"We investigate the extent to which the Palomar-Green (PG) Bright Quasar
Survey (BQS) is complete and representative of the general quasar population by
comparing with imaging and spectroscopy from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. A
comparison of SDSS and PG photometry of both stars and quasars reveals the need
to apply a color and magnitude recalibration to the PG data. Using the SDSS
photometric catalog, we define the PG's parent sample of objects that are not
main-sequence stars and simulate the selection of objects from this parent
sample using the PG photometric criteria and errors. This simulation shows that
the effective U-B cut in the PG survey is U-B < -0.71 (rather than the intended
U-B < -0.44), implying a color-related incompleteness. As the color
distribution of bright quasars peaks near U-B=-0.7 and the 2-sigma error in U-B
is comparable to the full width of the color distribution of quasars, the color
incompleteness of the BQS is approximately 50% and essentially random with
respect to U-B color for z<0.5. There is, however, a bias against bright
quasars at 0.5 < z < 1, which is induced by the color-redshift relation of
quasars (although quasars at z>0.5 are inherently rare in bright surveys in any
case). We find no evidence for any other systematic incompleteness when
comparing the distributions in color, redshift, and FIRST radio properties of
the BQS and a BQS-like subsample of the SDSS quasar sample. However, the
application of a bright magnitude limit biases the BQS toward the inclusion of
objects which are blue in g-i, in particular compared to the full range of g-i
colors found among the i-band limited SDSS quasars, and even at i-band
magnitudes comparable to those of the BQS objects.",2005-06-01T19:38:32Z
"Fourier Resolved Spectroscopy of the XMM-Newton Observations of MCG
  -6-30-15","We study the Frequency Resolved Spectra of the Seyfert galaxy MCG -6-30-15
obtained during two recent XMM-Newton observations. Splitting the Fourier
spectra in soft (<2 keV) and hard (>2 keV) bands, we find that the soft band
has a variability amplitude larger than the hard one on time scales longer than
10 ksec, while the opposite is true on time scales shorter than 3 ksec. Both
the soft and hard band spectra are well fitted by power laws of different
indices. The spectra of the hard band become clearly softer as the Fourier
Frequency decreases from 7x10^{-4} Hz to 10^{-5} Hz, while the spectral slope
of the soft band power law component is independent of the Fourier frequency.
The well known broad Fe Ka feature is absent at all frequency bins; this result
implies that this feature is not variable on time scales shorter than ~10^5
sec, in agreement with recent line variability studies. Strong spectral
features are also present in the soft X-ray band (at E~0.7), clearly
discernible in all Fourier Frequency bins. This fact is consistent with the
assumption that they are due to absorption by intervening matter within the
source.",2005-06-14T08:32:56Z
"Synthesis of H-alpha absorption in old stellar systems: Formation of the
  cluster red sequence by ""Downsizing""","We compute population synthesis models for the variation of H-alpha
absorption indices (HaA and HaF), as a function of age and metallicity in old
stellar systems. The models are based on the STELIB spectral library, and
defined at resolution of 3 Angstrom FWHM. The indices are found to be highly
sensitive to age variation, with only moderate response to metallicity. For
galaxies uncontaminated by nebular emission, our HaA index is more powerful in
breaking the age/metallicity degeneracy than H-beta or H-gamma_F. Using a
sample of red cluster galaxies carefully selected to exclude objects with
emission, we find a steep decline of HaA with velocity dispersion (slope -0.75
+/- 0.07 Angstrom/dex). The slope can be translated to constraints on age and
metallicity scaling relations, incorporating measurement and model errors. If
the HaA-sigma slope is due only to age, we obtain Age proportional to
sigma^{0.95 +/- 0.12}. Because HaA depends quite weakly on [Fe/H], a
metallicity interpretation would require Fe/H proportional to sigma^1.2 or
steeper. The HaA-sigma slope is consistent with the combined age and
metallicity scaling relations reported by Nelan et al. from classical Lick
indices. The relations obtained by Thomas et al. significantly under-predict
the observed slope. The discrepancy could arise from differences in the sample
compositions.We discuss in detail the effects of emission contamination on the
results, and conclude that these are unlikely to yield the observed behaviour
in the Ha-sigma relations. The steep age--mass relation supports a ""downsizing""
formation scenario: fainter red-sequence galaxies became quiescent at lower
redshifts, z < 0.5. This picture accords with recent observations of truncated
red sequences in clusters at z ~ 0.7.",2005-02-21T17:40:48Z
"The ACS Virgo Cluster Survey. VII. Resolving the Connection Between
  Globular Clusters and Ultra-Compact Dwarf Galaxies","We investigate the connection between globular clusters and ultra-compact
dwarf galaxies (UCDs) by examining the properties of several compact objects
associated with M87, all of which were previously classified as globular
clusters. Combining imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope with ground-based
Keck spectroscopy, we find two objects to have half-light radii, velocity
dispersions and mass-to-light ratios that are consistent with the predictions
of population synthesis models for old, metal-rich, luminous globular clusters.
Three other objects are much larger, with half-light radii of approximately
20pc, and have V-band mass-to-light ratios in the range 6-9. These objects,
which we consider to be UCDs, resemble the nuclei of nucleated dwarf elliptical
galaxies in Virgo, having similar mass-to-light ratios, luminosities and
colors. These UCDs are found to obey the extrapolated scaling relations of
galaxies more closely than those of Galactic globular clusters. There appears
to be a transition between the two types of stellar systems at a mass of about
two million solar masses. If the UCDs are gravitationally bound, then we
suggest that the presence of dark matter is the fundamental property
distinguishing globular clusters from UCDs. More than half of the UCD
candidates uncovered in the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey are associated with a
single galaxy -- M87 -- which suggests that proximity to the Virgo center may
be of critical importance for the formation of these objects. These results
show that distinguishing bonafide UCDs from bright globular clusters requires a
careful analysis of their detailed structural and dynamical properties,
particularly their mass-to-light ratios. (ABRIDGED)",2005-03-25T18:19:15Z
"Spectroscopic Redshifts to z > 2 for Optically Obscured Sources
  Discovered with the Spitzer Space Telescope","We have surveyed a field covering 9.0 degrees^2 within the NOAO Deep
Wide-Field Survey region in Bootes with the Multiband Imaging Photometer on the
Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) to a limiting 24 um flux density of 0.3 mJy.
Thirty one sources from this survey with F(24um) > 0.75 mJy which are optically
very faint (R > 24.5 mag) have been observed with the low-resolution modules of
the Infrared Spectrograph on SST. Redshifts derived primarily from strong
silicate absorption features are reported here for 17 of these sources; 10 of
these are optically invisible (R > 26 mag), with no counterpart in B_W, R, or
I. The observed redshifts for 16 sources are 1.7 < z < 2.8. These represent a
newly discovered population of highly obscured sources at high redshift with
extreme infrared to optical ratios. Using IRS spectra of local galaxies as
templates, we find that a majority of the sources have mid-infrared spectral
shapes most similar to ultraluminous infrared galaxies powered primarily by
AGN. Assuming the same templates also apply at longer wavelengths, bolometric
luminosities exceed 10^13 L(solar).",2005-02-10T15:27:52Z
Dwarf spheroidal galaxies in nearby groups imaged with HST,"An all-sky list of 88 nearby dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies with distances
D < 10 Mpc is considered. Most of the objects have recently been found by
Karachentseva & Karachentsev based on POSSII/ESO-SERC survey. A hundred more
dSph galaxies are expected in this volume, being missed so far because of their
low luminosity and low surface brightness. Apart from 22 dSph members of the
Local Group, there are 33 dSphs in other nearby groups that have been resolved
recently into stars with HST. Only 5% of the local dSphs are situated outside
the known groups. We discuss observational correlation between basic parameters
of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies, in particular, absolute magnitude, surface
brightness, metallicity, and so-called ""tidal index"". The observed number of
dSphs in group increases with luminosity of its brightest galaxy. In a
""synthetic"" nearby group, dwarf spheroidal galaxies are distributed in depth
quite symmetrically about the principal galaxy, having an rms distance scatter
of 200 kpc. Projected radial distribution of dSphs in the synthetic group
follows the profile N(R) ~ exp(-R/200 kpc).",2005-04-15T06:49:22Z
"A possible observational evidence for $θ^{-2}$ angular distribution
  of opening half-angle of GRB jets","We propose a method to estimate the pseudo jet opening half-angle of GRBs
using the spectral peak energy ($\Ep$)--peak luminosity relation (so called
Yonetoku relation) as well as the $\Ep$--collimation-corrected $\gamma$-ray
energy relation (so called Ghirlanda relation). For bursts with known jet break
times and redshifts, we compared the pseudo jet opening half-angle with the
standard one and found that the differences are within a factor 2. We apply the
method to 689 long GRBS. We found that the distribution function of the pseudo
jet opening half-angle obeys $f(\theta_j)\propto\theta_j^{-2.2 \pm 0.2}$ with
possible cutoffs for $\theta_j < 0.04$ and $\theta_j > 0.3$ although the
log-normal fit is also possible. $\theta^{-2}$ distribution is compatible with
the structured jet model. From the distribution function we found that the
beaming correction for the rate of GRBs is $\sim 340$, which means $\sim
10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$ galaxy$^{-1}$ or only one in $10^2$ type Ib/c supernovae. We
also found the evolution of the distribution function as a function of the
redshift.",2005-03-11T06:55:27Z
"Evidence of vorticity and shear at large angular scales in the WMAP
  data: a violation of cosmological isotropy?","Motivated by the large-scale asymmetry observed in the cosmic microwave
background sky, we consider a specific class of anisotropic cosmological models
-- Bianchi type VII_h -- and compare them to the WMAP first-year data on large
angular scales. Remarkably, we find evidence of a correlation which is ruled
out as a chance alignment at the 3sigma level. The best fit Bianchi model
corresponds to x=0.55, Omega_0=0.5, a rotation axis in the direction
(l,b)=(222degr,-62degr), shear (sigma/H)_0=2.4e-10 and a right--handed
vorticity (omega/H)_0=6.1e-10. Correcting for this component greatly reduces
the significance of the large-scale power asymmetry, resolves several anomalies
detected on large angular scales (ie. the low quadrupole amplitude and
quadrupole/octopole planarity and alignment), and can account for a
non--Gaussian ""cold spot"" on the sky. Despite the apparent inconsistency with
the best-fit parameters required in inflationary models to account for the
acoustic peaks, we consider the results sufficiently provocative to merit
further consideration.",2005-03-09T13:59:37Z
A new inflaton model beginning near the Planck epoch,"The Starobinsky model predicts a primordial inflation period without the
presence of an inflaton field. The modified version of this model predicts a
simple time dependence for the Hubble parameter $H(t)$, which decreases slowly
between the Planck epoch and the end of the inflation, $H(t)=M_{\rm Pl}-\beta
M_{\rm Pl}^2 t$, where $\beta$ is a dimensionless constant to be adjusted from
observations. We investigate an inflaton model which has the same time
dependence for $H(t)$. A reverse engineered inflaton potential for the time
dependence of $H$ is derived. Normalization of the derived inflaton potential
is determined by the condition that the observed density fluctuations,
$\delta\rho/\rho\approx 10^{-5}$, are created at $\sim 60 e$-folds before the
end of inflation. The derived potential indicates an energy (mass) scale,
$M_{\rm end}\sim 10^{13} {\rm GeV}$, at the end of inflation. Using the slow
roll parameters, which are obtained from this potential, we calculate the
spectral index for the scalar modes $n_S$ and the relative amplitude of the
tensor to scalar modes $r$. A tensor contribution, $r\simeq 0.13$, and an
approximately Harrison-Zeldovich density perturbation spectrum, $n_S \simeq
0.95$, are predicted.",2005-05-23T18:00:15Z
Neutrino asymmetry around black holes: Neutrinos interact with gravity,"Propagation of a fermion in curved space-time generates a gravitational
interaction due to coupling of its spin with the space-time curvature
connection. This gravitational interaction, which is an axial-four-vector
multiplied by a four gravitational vector potential, appears as a CPT violating
term in the Lagrangian which generates an opposite sign and thus asymmetry
between the left-handed and the right handed partners under the CPT
transformation. In the case of neutrinos, this property can generate a neutrino
asymmetry in the Universe. If the background metric is of the rotating black
hole, i.e. the Kerr geometry, this interaction for the neutrino is non-zero.
Therefore, the dispersion energy relations for the neutrino and its
anti-neutrino are different which give rise to the difference in their number
densities and the neutrino asymmetry in the Universe in addition to the known
relic asymmetry.",2005-05-21T21:15:25Z
"Constraint on Cosmological Model with Matter Creation Using
  Complementary Astronomical Observations","The universe with adiabatic matter creation is considered. It is thought that
the negative pressure caused by matter creation can play the role of a dark
energy component, and drive the accelerating expansion of the universe. Using
the Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data, the observational Hubble parameter data,
the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data and the Baryonic Acoustic
Oscillation (BAO) data, we make constraints on the cosmological parameters,
assuming a spatially flat universe. Our results show that the model with matter
creation is consistent with the SNe Ia data, while the joint constraints of all
these observational data disfavor this model. If the cosmological constant is
taken into account, a traditional model without matter creation is favored by
the joint observations.",2005-03-06T03:51:49Z
"""Missing Link"" Clouds in the Southern Galactic Plane Survey","We present an automated routine to search for HI self-absorption features
within the Southern Galactic Plane Survey (SGPS). The data were taken with the
Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and the Parkes Radio Telescope and
encompass 3 deg by 105 deg of sky in the Galactic plane. We apply our routine
to this entire region and derive spin temperatures and column densities for 70
of the larger HISA complexes, finding spin temperatures ranging from 6-41 K
with HI number densities of a few cm^-3. These `missing link' clouds fill in
the spin temperature and density gaps between dense molecular clouds and
diffuse atomic clouds. We compare the HI emission with 12CO emission and find
that 60% of detected HI self-absorption is correlated in space and in velocity
with a molecular counterpart. This is potentially due to a molecular/atomic gas
transition. We also compare HI self-absorption with Galactic spiral arms and
discuss the possibility of using it as a spiral arm tracer.",2005-03-24T22:09:57Z
"Supernova Neutrino-Effects on R-Process Nucleosynthesis in Black Hole
  Formation","Stars with a wide range of masses provide a variety of production sites for
intermediate-to-heavy mass elements. Very massive stars with mass $\geq 8
M_{\odot}$ culminate their evolution by supernova explosions which are presumed
to be the most viable candidate astrophysical sites of r-process
nucleosynthesis. If the models for the supernova r-process are correct, then
nucleosynthesis results could also pose a significant constraint on the remnant
of supernova explosions, $i.e.$ neutron star or black hole. In the case of very
massive core collapse, a remnant stellar black hole is thought to be formed.
Intense neutrino flux from the neutronized core and the neutrino sphere might
suddenly cease during the Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling phase because of the black
hole formation. It is interesting to explore observable consequences of such a
neutrino flux truncation. Arguments have recently been given in the literature
that even the neutrino mass may be determined from the time delay of deformed
neutrino energy spectrum after the cease of neutrino ejection (neutrino cutoff
effect). Here, we study the expected theoretical response of the r-process
nucleosynthesis to the neutrino cutoff effect in order to look for another
independent signature of this phenomenon. We found a sensitive response of the
r-process yield if the neutrino cutoff occurs after the critical time when the
expanding materials in the neutrino-driven wind drop out of the Nuclear
Statistical Equilibrium (NSE). The r-process nucleosynthesis yields change
maximally if the cutoff occurs during the r-process. Using this result,
connected with future detection of the time-variation of SN neutrino spectrum,
we are able to identify when the black hole formation occurs in the course of
SN collapse.",2005-06-05T08:25:21Z
"On Mechanics and Thermodynamics of a stellar galaxy in a two-component
  virial system and the Fundamental Plane","The paper confirms the existence of a special configuration (among the
infinite number of virial states) which a B stellar(Baryonic) component may
assume inside a given D dark halo potential well.This satisfies the d'Alembert
Principle of virtual works and its typical dimension works as a scale length
(tidal radius)induced on the gravitational field of the bright component by the
dark one.Its dynamic and thermodynamic properties are here analyzed in
connection with the physical reason for the existence of the Fundamental Plane

two power-law density profiles and two homogeneous cores and compared with some
observable scaling relations for pressure supported ellipticals.The virial
equilibrium stages of the 2-component system have to occur after a previous
violent relaxation phase. If the stellar B component is allowed to cool slowly
its virial evolution consists of a sequence of contractions with enough time to
rearrange the virial equilibrium after any step. The thermodynamic process
during the dynamical evolution is so divided into a sequence of transformations
which are irreversible but occur between two quasi-equilibrium stages.The
analysis allows the conclusion that the induced scale length is a real
confinement for the stellar system. The presence of this specific border on the
space of the baryonic luminous component has to be regarded as the physical
reason why a stellar galaxy belongs to the FP and why astrophysical objects,
with a completely different history and formation, but characterized by a tidal
radius (as the globular clusters are) lie on the same FP. An other problem
addressed is how this special configuration may be reached and why an
elliptical is not completely relaxed in respect to its dark halo.",2005-03-23T12:13:59Z
"Reduced magnetic braking and the magnetic capture model for the
  formation of ultra-compact binaries","A binary in which a slightly evolved star starts mass transfer to a neutron
star can evolve towards ultra-short orbital periods under the influence of
magnetic braking. This is called magnetic capture. In a previous paper we
showed that ultra-short periods are only reached for an extremely small range
of initial binary parameters, in particular orbital period and donor mass. Our
conclusion was based on one specific choice for the law of magnetic braking,
and for the loss of mass and angular momentum during mass transfer. In this
paper we show that for less efficient magnetic braking it is impossible to
evolve to ultra-short periods, independent of the amount of mass and associated
angular momentum lost from the binary.",2005-06-16T09:10:43Z
An absorbed view of a new class of INTEGRAL sources,"The European gamma-ray observatory INTEGRAL has found a group of hard X-ray
sources which are highly absorbed, i.e., with column densities higher than
about 10^{23}/cm^2. Here I give an overview of this class of INTEGRAL sources.
The X-ray, as well as the optical/IR, properties of these sources and their
location in the sky suggest that they belong to the class of high-mass X-ray
binaries, some of them possibly long-period X-ray pulsars. The donors in these
binaries are most probably giant or supergiant stars. I suggest that the soft
X-ray spectrum below ~5 keV of IGR J16318-4848, as well as in several other
X-ray binaries (e.g., XTE J0421+56), can be described by emission from a
compact object which is strongly absorbed by a partionally ionised dense
envelope.",2005-04-28T08:05:33Z
"The History of the Baryon Budget: Cosmic Logistics in a Hierarchical
  Universe","Using a series of high-resolution N-body hydrodynamical numerical
simulations, we investigate several scenarios for the evolution of the baryon
budget in galactic halos. We derive individual halo star formation history
(SFH), as well as the global star formation rate in the universe. We develop a
simple analytical model that allows us to compute surprisingly accurate
predictions, when compared to our simulations, but also to other simulations
presented in Springel & Hernquist (2003). The model depends on two main
parameters: the star formation time scale t* and the wind efficiency eta_w. We
also compute, for halos of a given mass, the baryon fraction in each of the
following phases: cold disc gas, hot halo gas and stars. Here again, our
analytical model predictions are in good agreement with simulation results, if
one correctly takes into account finite resolution effect.
  We compare predictions of our analytical model to several observational
constraints, and conclude that a very narrow range of the model parameters is
allowed. The important role played by galactic winds is outlined, as well as a
possible `superwind' scenario in groups and clusters. The `anti-hierarchical'
behavior of observed SFH is well reproduced by our best model with t*=3Gyr and
eta_w=1.5. We obtain in this case a present-day cosmic baryon budget of Omega*=
0.004, Omega_cold=0.0004, Omega_hot=0.01 and Omega_back=0.02 (diffuse
background).",2005-05-23T14:57:56Z
The dark energy-dominated Universe,"In this paper we investigate the epochs in which the Universe started
accelerating and when it began to become dark energy-dominated (i.e., the
dynamics of the expansion of the Universe dominated by the dark energy). We
provide analytic expressions to calculate the redshifts of these epochs as a
function of density parameters. Moreover, we review and discuss cosmological
models with a dark energy component, which can have an interesting
characteristic, namely, they never stop accelerating. This holds even if the
Universe is at present time either flat, open, or closed. If the dark energy is
the cosmological constant the Universe will eventually end up undergoing an
exponentially expansion phase, and the total density parameter converging to
$\Omega=1$. This is exactly what is considered in inflationary scenario to
generate the initial conditions for the big bang. One can then argue that the
Universe begun with an inflationary phase and will end up with another
inflationary phase. Thus, it follows that in both the early and the late
Universe $\Omega \to 1$. We also discuss the above issues in the context of the
XCDM parametrization.",2005-03-04T14:22:07Z
Chemical differentiation along the CepA-East outflows,"We present the results of a multiline survey at mm-wavelengths of the Cepheus
A star forming region. Four main flows have been identified: three pointing in
the SW, NE, and SE directions and accelerating high density CS clumps. The
fourth outflow, revealed by high-sensitivity HDO observations, is pointing
towards South and is associated with conditions particularly favourable to a
chemical enrichment. The analysis of the line profiles shows that the SiO
molecule dominates at the highest velocities and at the highest excitation
conditions, confirming its close association with shocks. H2S, SO2, and SO
preferentially trace more quiescent regions than SiO, and in particular a lack
of bright H2S emission at the highest velocities is found. OCS and H2CS emit at
quite high velocities, where the abundances of three shock tracers like SiO,
CH3OH, and HDO are higher. These results may indicate that H2S is not the only
major sulphur carrier in the grain mantles, and that OCS and H2CS may probably
play an important role on the grains; or that alternatively they rapidly form
once the mantle is evaporated after the passage of a shock. Finally, the
outflow peak emission has been compared with recent time-dependent sulphur
chemistry models: the results indicate that, if associated with accurate
measurements of the physical conditions, the CH3OH/H2CS column density ratio
can be used as an effective chemical clock to date the age of shocked gas.",2005-05-09T14:14:02Z
"CMB Tomography: Reconstruction of Adiabatic Primordial Scalar Potential
  Using Temperature and Polarization Maps","Assuming linearity of the perturbations at the time of decoupling, we
reconstruct the primordial scalar potential from the temperature and
polarization anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation. In
doing so we derive an optimal linear filter which, when operated on the
spherical harmonic coefficients of the anisotropy maps, returns an estimate of
the primordial scalar potential fluctuations in a spherical slice. The
reconstruction is best in a thick shell around the decoupling epoch; the
quality of the reconstruction depends on the redshift of the slice within this
shell. With high quality maps of the temperature and polarization anisotropies
it will be possible to obtain a reconstruction of potential fluctuation on
scales between l=2 and l ~ 300 at the redshift of decoupling, with some
information about the three-dimensional shapes of the perturbations in a shell
of width 250Mpc.",2005-05-18T17:49:34Z
Dark Energy Constraints from the CTIO Lensing Survey,"We perform a cosmological parameter analysis of the 75 square degree CTIO
lensing survey in conjunction with CMB and Type Ia supernovae data. For Lambda
CDM cosmologies, we find that the amplitude of the power spectrum at low
redshift is given by sigma_8 = 0.81 (+0.15,-0.10, 95% c.l.), where the error
bar includes both statistical and systematic errors. The total of all
systematic errors is smaller than the statistical errors, but they do make up a
significant fraction of the error budget. We find that weak lensing improves
the constraints on dark energy as well. The (constant) dark energy equation of
state parameter, w, is measured to be -0.89 (+0.16,-0.21, 95% c.l.).
Marginalizing over a constant $w$ slightly changes the estimate of sigma_8 to
0.79 (+0.17, -0.14, 95% c.l.). We also investigate variable w cosmologies, but
find that the constraints weaken considerably; the next generation surveys are
needed to obtain meaningful constraints on the possible time evolution of dark
energy.",2005-02-14T20:57:31Z
A Survey for Planetary Transits in the Field of NGC 7789,"We present results from 30 nights of observations of the open cluster NGC
7789 with the WFC camera on the INT telescope in La Palma. From ~900 epochs, we
obtained lightcurves and Sloan r-i colours for ~33000 stars, with ~2400 stars
with better than 1% precision. We expected to detect ~2 transiting hot Jupiter
planets if 1% of stars host such a companion and that a typical hot Jupiter
radius is ~1.2RJ. We find 24 transit candidates, 14 of which we can assign a
period. We rule out the transiting planet model for 21 of these candidates
using various robust arguments. For 2 candidates we are unable to decide on
their nature, although it seems most likely that they are eclipsing binaries as
well. We have one candidate exhibiting a single eclipse for which we derive a
radius of 1.81+0.09-0.00RJ. Three candidates remain that require follow-up
observations in order to determine their nature.",2005-03-02T13:03:43Z
"Filter design for the detection of compact sources based on the
  Neyman-Pearson detector","This paper considers the problem of compact source detection on a Gaussian
background in 1D. Two aspects of this problem are considered: the design of the
detector and the filtering of the data. Our detection scheme is based on local
maxima and it takes into account not only the amplitude but also the curvature
of the maxima. A Neyman-Pearson test is used to define the region of
acceptance, that is given by a sufficient linear detector that is independent
on the amplitude distribution of the sources. We study how detection can be
enhanced by means of linear filters with a scaling parameter and compare some
of them (the Mexican Hat wavelet, the matched and the scale-adaptive filters).
We introduce a new filter, that depends on two free parameters (biparametric
scale-adaptive filter). The value of these two parameters can be determined,
given the a priori pdf of the amplitudes of the sources, such that the filter
optimizes the performance of the detector in the sense that it gives the
maximum number of real detections once fixed the number density of spurious
sources. The combination of a detection scheme that includes information on the
curvature and a flexible filter that incorporates two free parameters (one of
them a scaling) improves significantly the number of detections in some
interesting cases. In particular, for the case of weak sources embedded in
white noise the improvement with respect to the standard matched filter is of
the order of 40%. Finally, an estimation of the amplitude of the source is
introduced and it is proven that such an estimator is unbiased and it has
maximum efficiency. We perform numerical simulations to test these theoretical
ideas and conclude that the results of the simulations agree with the
analytical ones.",2005-03-07T15:07:48Z
Destruction of formic acid by soft X-rays in star-forming regions,"Formic acid is much more abundant in the solid state, both in interstellar
ices and cometary ices, than in the interstellar gas (ice/gas ~ 10^{4}) and
this point remains a puzzle. The goal of this work is to experimentally study
ionization and photodissociation processes of HCOOH (formic acid), a glycine
precursor molecule. The measurements were taken at the Brazilian Synchrotron
Light Laboratory (LNLS), employing soft X-ray photons from toroidal grating
monochromator TGM) beamline (200 - 310 eV). Mass spectra were obtained using
photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) method. Kinetic energy
distributions and abundances for each ionic fragment have been obtained from
the analysis of the corresponding peak shapes in the mass spectra.
Photoionization and photodissociation cross sections were also determined. Due
to the large photodissociation cross section of HCOOH it is possible that in
PDRs regions, just after molecules evaporation from the grain surface, formic
acid molecules are almost totally destroyed by soft X-rays, justifying the
observed low abundance of HCOOH in the gaseous phase. The preferential path for
the glycine formation from formic acid may be through the ice phase reaction.

"Evolution in the Color-Magnitude Relation of Early-Type Galaxies in
  Clusters of Galaxies at z~=1","We present a study of the color evolution of elliptical and S0 galaxies in
six clusters of galaxies inside the redshift range 0.78 < z < 1.27. For each
cluster, we used imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope to determine
morphological types by both an automated technique and from visual inspection.
We performed simulations to determine the accuracy of the automated
classifications and found a success rate of ~75% at m(L*) or brighter
magnitudes for most of our HST imaging data with the fraction of late--type
galaxies identified as early--type galaxies to be ~10% at m(L*) to ~20% at
m(L*)+2. From ground based optical and near-infrared imaging, we measured the
zero-point and scatter in the color--magnitude relation of the early-type
populations, which when combined with Stanford et al. (1998), yields a sample
of cluster early--type galaxies that span a lookback time of 9 gigayears from
the present. We see the colors of the early--type cluster members become bluer
with increasing redshift. We fit a set of models to the change in the color as
a function of redshift with the best fitting values ranging from a formation
redshift of 3^+2_-1 to 5_-3. The large scatter in resulting formation epochs,
which depends on the details of the models used, implies that we can conclude
that the oldest stars in the elliptical galaxies appear to have formed at
redshifts of z>3. We find possible evolution in the scatter of the colors, with
some high redshift clusters showing scatter as small as the Coma cluster but
others showing much larger scatter. Those clusters with a small scatter imply
either a formation redshift of at least z ~ 3 or a smaller spread in the range
of formation redshifts at lower redshifts, assuming a Gaussian distribution of
star-formation around the mean epoch.",2005-03-16T19:23:11Z
Duality extended Chaplygin cosmologies with a big rip,"We consider modifications to the Friedmann equation motivated by recent
proposals along these lines pursuing an explanation to the observed late time
acceleration. Here we show those modifications can be framed within a theory
with self-interacting gravity, where the term self-interaction refers here to
the presence of functions of $\rho$ and $p$ in the right hand side of the
Einstein equations. We then discuss the construction of the duals of the
cosmologies generated within that framework. After that we investigate the
modifications required to generate generalized and modified Chaplygin
cosmologies and show that their duals belong to a larger family of cosmologies
we call extended Chaplygin cosmologies. Finally, by letting the parameters of
those models take values not earlier considered in the literature we show some
representatives of that family of cosmologies display sudden future
singularities, which indicates their behavior is rather different from
generalized or modified Chaplygin gas cosmologies. This reinforces the idea
that modifications of gravity can be responsible for unexpected evolutionary
features in the universe.",2005-05-12T12:19:04Z
"An Extremely Large Excess of 18O in the Hydrogen-Deficient Carbon Star,
  HD 137613","We report the discovery of a uniquely large excess of 18O in the
hydrogen-deficient carbon (HdC) star, HD 137613, based on a spectrum of the
first overtone bands of CO at 2.3-2.4 micron in which three strong absorption
bands of 12C18O are clearly present. Bands of 12C16O also are present but no
bands of 13C16O or 12C17O are seen. We estimate an isotopic ratio 16O/18O ~1.
The Solar value of this ratio is ~500. Neither He-core burning nor He-shell
flash burning can produce the isotopic ratios of oxygen and carbon observed in
HD 137613. However, a remarkable similarity exists between the observed
abundances and those found in the outer layers of the broad He-shell of
early-AGB stars, soon after the end of He-core burning. It is not known how the
outer envelope down to the He-shell could be lost but some mechanism of
enhanced mass loss must be involved. HD 137613 may be a post-early-AGB star
with the outer layers of the former He-burning shell as its photosphere.
  The unusual elemental abundances of the HdC stars resemble those of the R
Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars, but HdC stars do not produce clouds of dust that
produce declines in brightness. None of the other RCB or HdC stars observed
shows significant 18O.",2005-03-08T23:13:22Z
Using gravitational-wave standard sirens,"Gravitational waves (GWs) from supermassive binary black hole (BBH) inspirals
are potentially powerful standard sirens (the GW analog to standard candles)
(Schutz 1986, 2002). Because these systems are well-modeled, the space-based GW
observatory LISA will be able to measure the luminosity distance (but not the
redshift) to some distant massive BBH systems with 1-10% accuracy. This
accuracy is largely limited by pointing error: GW sources generally are poorly
localized on the sky. Localizing the binary independently (e.g., through
association with an electromagnetic counterpart) greatly reduces this
positional error. An electromagnetic counterpart may also allow determination
of the event's redshift. In this case, BBH coalescence would constitute an
extremely precise (better than 1%) standard candle visible to high redshift. In
practice, gravitational lensing degrades this precision, though the candle
remains precise enough to provide useful information about the
distance-redshift relation. Even if very rare, these GW standard sirens would
complement, and increase confidence in, other standard candles.",2005-04-27T20:22:30Z
Magnetars origin and progenitors with enhanced rotation,"Among a dozen known magnetar candidates there are no binary objects. As an
estimate of a fraction of binary neutron stars is about 10% it is reasonable to
address the question of solitarity of magnetars, to estimate theoretically the
fraction of binary objects among them, and to mark o probable companions. We
present population synthesis calculations of binary systems. Our goal is to
estimate the number of neutron stars originated from progenitors with enhanced
rotation, as such compact objects can be expected to have large magnetic
fields, ie. they can be magnetars. The fraction of such neutron stars in our
calculations is about 13-16%. Most of these objects are isolated due to
coalescences of components prior to a neutron star formation, or due to a
system disruption after a supernova explosion. The fraction of such neutron
stars in survived binaries is about 1% or lower. Their most numerous companions
are black holes.",2005-05-19T13:33:03Z
"Sensitivity of r-Process Nucleosynthesis to Light-Element Nuclear
  Reactions","We study the efficiency and sensitivity of r-process nucleosynthesis to 18
light-element nuclear reaction rates. We adopt empirical power-law relations to
parameterize the reaction sensitivities. We utilize two different hydrodynamic
models for the neutrino-driven winds in order to study the dependence of our
result on supernova wind models. We also utilize an exponential model to
approximate a wide variety of other plausible conditions for the r-process. We
identify several specific nuclear reactions among light neutron-rich nuclei
that play a critical role in determining the final r-process nucleosynthesis
yields. As an illustration, we examine ``semi-waiting'' points among the carbon
isotopes. We show that not only neutron capture and
  $\beta$-decay, but also $(\alpha, \mathrm{n})$ reactions are important in
determining waiting points along the r-process path. Our numerical results from
this sensitivity analysis serve foremost to clarify which light nuclear
reactions are most influential in determining the final r-process abundances.
We also quantify the effects of present nuclear uncertainties on the final
r-process abundances. This study thus emphasizes and motivates which future
determinations of nuclear reaction rates will most strongly impact our
understanding of r-process nucleosynthesis.",2005-04-24T04:58:38Z
"Radiative Effect on Particle Acceleration via Relativistic
  Electromagnetic Expansion","The radiation damping effect on the diamagnetic relativistic pulse
accelerator (DRPA) is studied in two-and-half dimensional Particle-in-Cell
(PIC) simulation with magnetized electron-positron plasmas. Self-consistently
solved radiation damping force converts particle energy to radiation energy.
The DRPA is still robust with radiation, and the Lorentz factor of the most
high energy particles reach more than two thousand before they decouple from
the electromagnetic pulse. Resulted emitted power from the pulse front is lower
in the radiative case than the estimation from the non-radiative case due to
the radiation damping. The emitted radiation is strongly linearly polarized and
peaked within few degrees from the direction of Poynting flux.",2005-04-25T23:09:48Z
Gamma-Ray Observations of a Giant Flare from The Magnetar SGR 1806-20,"Magnetars comprise two classes of rotating neutron stars (Soft Gamma
Repeaters (SGRs) and Anomalous X-ray Pulsars), whose X-ray emission is powered
by an ultrastrong magnetic field, B ~ 10^15 G. Occasionally SGRs enter into
active episodes producing many short X-ray bursts; extremely rarely (about once
per 50 years per source), SGRs emit a giant flare, an event with total energy
at least 1000 times higher than their typical bursts. Here we report that, on
2004 December 27, SGR 1806-20 emitted the brightest extra-solar transient event
ever recorded, even surpassing the full moon brightness for 0.2 seconds. The
total (isotropic) flare energy is 2x10^46 erg, 100 times higher than the only
two previous events, making this flare a once in a century event. This colossal
energy release likely occurred during a catastrophic reconfiguration of the
magnetar's magnetic field. Such an event would have resembled a short, hard
Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) if it had occurred within 40 Mpc, suggesting that
extragalactic SGR flares may indeed form a subclass of GRBs.",2005-03-02T02:54:08Z
"Time variations of the narrow FeII and HI spectral emission lines from
  the close vicinity of Eta Carinae during the spectral event of 2003","The spectrum of Eta Carinae and its ejecta shows slow variations over a
period of 5.5 years. However, the spectrum changes drastically on a time scale
of days once every period called the 'spectral event'. We report on variations
in the narrow emission line spectrum of gas condensations (the Weigelt blobs)
close to the central star during a spectral event. The rapid changes in the
stellar radiation field illuminating the blobs make the blobs a natural
astrophysical laboratory to study atomic photoprocesses. The different
responses of the HI Paschen lines, fluorescent <FeII> lines and forbidden
[FeII] lines allow us to identify the processes and estimate physical
conditions in the blobs. This paper is based on observations from the Pico dos
Dias Observatory (LNA/Brazil) during the previous event in June 2003.",2005-03-18T12:17:31Z
Absorption Systems In Radio-Selected QSO Surveys,"Radio-selected samples of quasars with complete optical identifications offer
an ideal dataset with which to investigate dust bias associated with
intervening absorption systems. Here, we review our work on the Complete
Optical and Radio Absorption Line System (CORALS) survey whose aim is to
quantify this bias and assess the impact of dust on absorber statistics. First,
we review previously published results on the number density and gas content of
high column density absorbers over the redshift range 0.6 < z < 3.5. We then
present the latest results from CORALS which focus on measuring the metal
content of our unbiased absorber sample and an investigation of their
optical--IR colours. Overall we find that although dust is unarguably present
in absorption galaxies, the level appears to be low enough that the statistics
of previous magnitude limited samples have not been severely affected and that
the subsequent reddening of background QSOs is small.",2005-05-05T20:41:27Z
"Full computation of massive AGB evolution. II. The role of mass loss and
  cross-sections","In the course of a systematic exploration of the uncertainties associated to
the input micro- and macro-physics in the modeling of the evolution of
intermediate mass stars during their Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase, we
focus on the role of the nuclear reactions rates and mass loss. We consider
masses 3<M/Msun<6.5 for a metallicity typical for Globular Cluster, Z=0.001,
and compare the results obtained by computing the full nucleosynthesis with hot
bottom burning (HBB), for a network of 30 elements, using either the NACRE or
the Cameron & Fowler (1988) cross-sections. The results differ in particular
with respect to the Na23 nucleosynthesis (which is more efficient in the NACRE
case) and the magnesium isotopes ratios. For both choices, however, the CNO
nucleosynthesis shows that the C+N+O is constant within a factor of two, in our
models employing a very efficient convection treatment. Different mass loss
rates alter the physical conditions for HBB and the length of the AGB phase,
changing indirectly the chemical yields. These computations show that the
predictive power of our AGB models is undermined by these uncertainties. In
particular, it appears at the moment very difficult to strongly accept or
dismiss that these sources play a key-role in the pollution of Globular
Clusters (GCs)",2005-05-11T07:08:35Z
"Distributions of the Hardness Ratio of short and Long Gamma-Ray Bursts
  in Different Time Intervals within the First 2 Seconds","In the present paper, we investigated the distribution of hardness ratio (HR)
for short and long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in different time scales for the
first two seconds. After including and subtracting the background count, we
performed a Kolmogorov--Smirnov (K-S) test to the HR distributions of the two
classes of GRBs in each time interval. Our analysis shows that the
probabilities of the KS test to the distributions are very small, suggesting
that the two classes of bursts are unlikely to arise from the same HR
distributions, and indicating that they probably originate from the different
physical processes and central engine. In addition, we found that the hardness
ratio of short bursts within the time interval of 0$-$0.96 seconds changes
hard-to-soft, on the other hand long bursts do not. The two kinds of bursts
have different characteristics in the first 2 seconds which might be associated
with different physical mechanisms.",2005-03-16T09:53:14Z
Bright X-ray Flares in Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows,"Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows have provided important clues to the nature
of these massive explosive events, providing direct information on the nearby
environment and indirect information on the central engine that powers the
burst. We report the discovery of two bright X-ray flares in GRB afterglows,
including a giant flare comparable in total energy to the burst itself, each
peaking minutes after the burst. These strong, rapid X-ray flares imply that
the central engines of the bursts have long periods of activity, with strong
internal shocks continuing for hundreds of seconds after the gamma-ray emission
has ended.",2005-06-07T00:48:14Z
Can the initial singularity be detected by cosmological tests?,"In the present paper we raise the question whether initial cosmological
singularity can be proved from the cosmological tests. The classical general
relativity predict the existence of singularity in the past if only some energy
conditions are satisfied. On the other hand the latest quantum gravity
applications to cosmology suggest of possibility of avoiding the singularity
and replace it with the bounce. The distant type Ia supernovae data are used to
constraints on bouncing evolutional scenario where square of the Hubble
function $H^2$ is given by formulae
$H^2=H^2_0[\Omega_{m,0}(1+z)^{m}-\Omega_{n,0}(1+z)^{n}]$, where $\Omega_{m,0},
\Omega_{n,0}>0$ are density parameters and $n>m>0$. We show that the on the
base of the SNIa data standard bouncing models can be ruled out on the
$4\sigma$ confidence level. If we add the cosmological constant to the standard
bouncing model then we obtain as the best-fit that the parameter $\Omega_{n,0}$
is equal zero which means that the SNIa data do not support the bouncing term
in the model. The bounce term is statistically insignificant the present epoch.
We also demonstrate that BBN offer the possibility of obtaining stringent
constraints of the extra term $\Omega_{n,0}$. The other observational test
methods like CMB and the age of oldest objects in the Universe are used. We
also use the Akaike informative criterion to select a model according to the
goodness of fit and we conclude that this term should be ruled out by Occam's
razor, which makes that the big bang is favored rather then bouncing scenario.",2005-04-21T11:20:07Z
"Ultraviolet, Optical, and X-Ray Observations of the Type Ia Supernova
  2005am with Swift","We present ultraviolet and optical light curves in six broadband filters and
grism spectra obtained by Swift's Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope for the Type Ia
supernova SN2005am. The data were collected beginning about four days before
the B-band maximum, with excellent coverage of the rapid decline phase and
later observations extending out to 69 days after the peak. The optical and
near UV light curve match well those of SN1992A. The other UV observations
constitute the first set of light curves shorter than 2500 Angstroms and allow
us to compare the light curve evolution in three UV bands. The UV behavior of
this and other low redshift supernovae can be used to constrain theories of
progenitor evolution or to interpret optical light curves of high redshift
supernovae. Using Swift's X-Ray Telescope, we also report the upper limit to
SN2005am's X-ray luminosity to be 1.77 x 10^40 erg s^-1 in the 0.3--10 keV
range from 58,117 s of exposure time.",2005-06-01T19:21:30Z
"The Oxford-Dartmouth Thirty Degree Survey II: Clustering of Bright Lyman
  Break Galaxies - Strong Luminosity Dependent Bias at z=4","We present measurements of the clustering properties of bright ($L>L_{*}$)
z$\sim$4 Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) selected from the Oxford-Dartmouth Thirty
Degree Survey (ODT). We describe techniques used to select and evaluate our
candidates and calculate the angular correlation function which we find best
fitted by a power law, $\omega(\theta)=A_{w}\theta^{-\beta}$ with $A_{w}=15.4$
(with $\theta$ in arcseconds), using a constrained slope of $\beta=0.8$. Using
a redshift distribution consistent with photometric models, we deproject this
correlation function and find a comoving $r_{0}=11.4_{-1.9}^{+1.7}$
h$_{100}^{-1}$ Mpc in a $\Omega_m=0.3$ flat $\Lambda$ cosmology for
$i_{AB}\leq24.5$. This corresponds to a linear bias value of
$b=8.1_{-2.6}^{+2.0}$ (assuming $\sigma_{8}=0.9$). These data show a
significantly larger $r_{0}$ and $b$ than previous studies at $z\sim4$. We
interpret this as evidence that the brightest LBGs have a larger bias than
fainter ones, indicating a strong luminosity dependence for the measured bias
of an LBG sample. Comparing this against recent results in the literature at
fainter (sub-$L_{*}$) limiting magnitudes, and with simple models describing
the relationship between LBGs and dark matter haloes, we discuss the
implications on the implied environments and nature of LBGs. It seems that the
brightest LBGs (in contrast with the majority sub-$L_{*}$ population), have
clustering properties, and host dark matter halo masses, that are consistent
with them being progenitors of the most massive galaxies today.",2005-05-02T09:17:10Z
"Evaluating Gaia performances on eclipsing binaries. IV. Orbits and
  stellar parameters for SV Cam, BS Dra and HP Dra","This is the fourth in a series of papers that aim both to provide reasonable
orbits for a number of eclipsing binaries and to evaluate the expected
performance of Gaia of these objects and the accuracy that is achievable in the
determination of such fundamental stellar parameters as mass and radius. In
this paper, we attempt to derive the orbits and physical parameters for three
eclipsing binaries in the mid-F to mid-G spectral range. As for previous
papers, only the Hp, Vt, Bt photometry from the Hipparcos/Tycho mission and
ground-based radial velocities from spectroscopy in the region 8480-8740 A are
used in the analyses. These data sets simulate the photometric and
spectroscopic data that are expected to be obtained by Gaia, the approved ESA
Cornerstone mission to be launched in 2011. The systems targeted in this paper
are SV Cam, BS Dra and HP Dra. SV Cam and BS Dra have been studied previously,
allowing comparisons of the derived parameters with those from full scale and
devoted ground-based investigations. HP Dra has no published orbital solution.
SV Cam has a beta Lyrae type light curve and the others have Algol-like light
curves. SV Cam has the complication of light curve anomalies, usually
attributed to spots; BS Dra has non-solar metallicity, and HP Dra appears to
have a small eccentricity and a sizeable time derivative in the argument of the
periastron. Thus all three provide interesting and different test cases.",2005-06-06T10:07:02Z
GU Boo: A New 0.6 Msun Detached Eclipsing Binary,"We have found a new low-mass, double-lined, detached eclipsing binary, GU
Boo, among a sample of new variables from the ROTSE-I database. The binary has
an orbital period of 0.488728 +/- 0.000002 days, and estimated apparent
magnitudes Vrotse = 13.7 and I = 11.8. Our analysis of the light and radial
velocity curves of the system yields individual masses and radii of M1= 0.610
+/- 0.007 Msun, M2 = 0.599 +/- 0.006 Msun, R1= 0.623 +/- 0.016 Rsun, R2= 0.620
+/- 0.020 Rsun. The stars in GU Boo are therefore very similar to the
components of the eclipsing binary YY Gem. For this study we have adopted a
mean effective temperature for the binary of Teff = 3870 +/- 130 K. Based on
its space velocities we suggest that GU Boo is a main sequence binary, possibly
with an age of several Gyr. The metallicity of the binary is not well
constrained at this point but we speculate that it should not be very different
from solar. We have compared the physical parameters of GU Boo with current
low-mass stellar models, where we accounted for uncertainties in age and
metallicity by considering a wide range of values for those parameters. Our
comparisons reveal that all the models underestimate the radii of the
components of GU Boo by at least 10-15%. This result is in agreement with the
recent studies of YY Gem and CU Cnc.",2005-04-29T21:29:36Z
HST/NICMOS observations of a proto-brown dwarf candidate,"We present deep HST/NICMOS observations peering through the outflow cavity of
the protostellar candidate IRAS 04381+2540 in the Taurus Molecular Cloud-1. A
young stellar object as central source, a jet and a very faint and close (0.6"")
companion are identified. The primary and the companion have similar colours,
consistent with strong reddening. We argue that the companion is neither a
shock-excited knot nor a background star. The colour/magnitude information
predicts a substellar upper mass limit for the companion, but the final
confirmation will require spectroscopic information. Because of its geometry,
young age and its rare low-mass companion, this system is likely to provide a
unique insight into the formation of brown dwarfs.",2005-02-23T17:15:26Z
"A Deep Look at the T-Type Brown Dwarf Binary $ε$ Indi Bab with
  Chandra and ATCA","We present deep observations of the nearby T-type brown dwarf binary
$\epsilon$ Indi Bab in radio with the Australia Telescope Compact Array and in
X-rays with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Despite long integration times, the
binary (composed of T1 and T6 dwarfs) was not detected in either wavelength
regime. We reached $3\sigma$ upper limits of $1.23 \times 10^{12}$ and $1.74
\times 10^{12}$ erg/s/Hz for the radio luminosity at 4.8 GHz and 8.64 GHz,
respectively; in the X-rays, the upper limit in the $0.1-10$ keV band was $3.16
\times 10^{23}$ erg/s. We discuss the above results in the framework of
magnetic activity in ultracool, low-mass dwarfs.",2005-04-19T21:00:18Z
"Cosmological parameters from combined second- and third-order aperture
  mass statistics of cosmic shear","We present predictions for cosmological parameter constraints from combined
measurements of second- and third-order statistics of cosmic shear. We define
the generalized third-order aperture mass statistics <M_ap^3> and show that it
contains much more information about the bispectrum of the projected matter
density than the skewness of the aperture mass. From theoretical models as well
as from LCDM ray-tracing simulations, we calculate <M_ap^2> and <M_ap^3> and
their dependence on cosmological parameters. The covariances including shot
noise and cosmic variance of M_ap^2, M_ap^3 and their cross-correlation are
calculated using ray-tracing simulations. We perform an extensive Fisher matrix
analysis, and for various combinations of cosmological parameters, we predict
1-sigma-errors corresponding to measurements from a deep 29 square degree
cosmic shear survey. Although the parameter degeneracies can not be lifted
completely, the (linear) combination of second- and third-order aperture mass
statistics reduces the errors significantly. The strong degeneracy between
Omega_m and sigma_8, present for all second-order cosmic shear measures, is
diminished substantially, whereas less improvement is found for the
near-degenerate pair consisting of the shape parameter Gamma and the spectral
index n_s. Uncertainties in the source galaxy redshift z_0 increase the errors
of all other parameters.",2005-05-29T12:20:47Z
Friedmann cosmology on codimension 2 brane with time dependent tension,"A solution of codimension 2 brane is found for which 4 dimensional Friedmann
cosmology is recovered on the brane with time dependent tension, in the
Einstein frame. The effective parameter $p/\rho$ of equation of state on the
brane can be quintessence like, de Sitter like or phantom like, depending on
integration constants of the solution.",2005-04-07T10:46:17Z
Statistical isotropy of CMB anisotropy from WMAP,"The statistical expectation values of the temperature fluctuations of cosmic
microwave background (CMB) are assumed to be preserved under rotations of the
sky. We investigate the statistical isotropy of the CMB anisotropy maps
recently measured by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) using
bipolar spherical harmonic power spectrum proposed in Hajian & Souradeep 2003.
The Bipolar Power Spectrum (BiPS) is estimated for the full sky CMB anisotropy
maps of the first year WMAP data. The method allows us to isolate regions in
multipole space and study each region independently. This search shows no
evidence for violation of statistical isotropy in the first-year WMAP data on
angular scales larger than that corresponding to l~60.",2005-02-12T10:00:21Z
Synthetic Line Profiles for Pulsating Red Giants,"Pulsation influences atmospheric structures of variable AGB stars (Miras)
considerably. Spectral lines of the CO dv=3 vibration-rotation bands (at
1.6mue) therefore have a very characteristic appearance in time series of
high-resolution spectra. Coupled to the light cycle they can be observed blue-
or red-shifted, for some phases even line doubling is found. This is being
explained by radial pulsations and shock fronts emerging in the atmospheres.
Based on dynamic model atmospheres synthetic CO line profiles were calculated
consistently, reproducing this scenario qualitatively.",2005-03-30T13:06:44Z
"The C4 Clustering Algorithm: Clusters of Galaxies in the Sloan Digital
  Sky Survey","We present the ""C4 Cluster Catalog"", a new sample of 748 clusters of galaxies
identified in the spectroscopic sample of the Second Data Release (DR2) of the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The C4 cluster--finding algorithm identifies
clusters as overdensities in a seven-dimensional position and color space, thus
minimizing projection effects which plagued previous optical clusters
selection. The present C4 catalog covers ~2600 square degrees of sky with
groups containing 10 members to massive clusters having over 200 cluster
members with redshifts. We provide cluster properties like sky location, mean
redshift, galaxy membership, summed r--band optical luminosity (L_r), velocity
dispersion, and measures of substructure. We use new mock galaxy catalogs to
investigate the sensitivity to the various algorithm parameters, as well as to
quantify purity and completeness. These mock catalogs indicate that the C4
catalog is ~90% complete and 95% pure above M_200 = 1x10^14 solar masses and
within 0.03 <=z <= 0.12. The C4 algorithm finds 98% of X-ray identified
clusters and 90% of Abell clusters within 0.03 <= z <= 0.12. We show that the
L_r of a cluster is a more robust estimator of the halo mass (M_200) than the
line-of-sight velocity dispersion or the richness of the cluster. L_r. The
final SDSS data will provide ~2500 C4 clusters and will represent one of the
largest and most homogeneous samples of local clusters.",2005-03-31T20:25:16Z
"Mass-to-Light Ratios of Field Early-Type Galaxies at z~1 from Ultra-Deep
  Spectroscopy: Evidence for Mass-dependent Evolution","We present an analysis of the Fundamental Plane for a sample of 27 field
early-type galaxies in the redshift range 0.6<z<1.15. The galaxies in this
sample have high S/N spectra obtained at the VLT and high resolution imaging
from the ACS. We find that the mean evolution in M/L of our sample is $Delta ln
(M/L_B) = -1.74+/-0.16z$, with a large galaxy-to-galaxy scatter. This value can
be too low by 0.3 due to selection effects, resulting in $Delta ln (M/L_B) =
-1.43+/-0.16z$. The strong correlation between M/L and rest-frame color
indicates that the observed scatter is not due to measurement errors, but due
to intrinsic differences between the stellar populations of the galaxies. This
pace of evolution is much faster than the evolution of cluster galaxies.
However, we find that the measured M/L evolution strongly depends on galaxy
mass. For galaxies with masses $M>2 x 10^11 Msol$, we find no significant
difference between the evolution of field and cluster galaxies: $Delta ln
(M/L_B) = -1.20+/-0.18z for field galaxies and $Delta ln (M/L_B) =
-1.12+/-0.06z$ for cluster galaxies. The relation between the measured M/L
evolution and mass is partially due to selection effects. However, even when
taking selection effects into account, we still find a relation between M/L
evolution and mass, which is most likely caused by a lower mean age and a
larger intrinsic scatter for low mass galaxies. Results from lensing early-type
galaxies, which are mass-selected, show a very similar trend with mass. This,
combined with our findings, provides evidence for down-sizing. Previous studies
of the rate of evolution of field early-type galaxies found a large range of
mutually exclusive values. We show that these differences are largely caused by
the differences between fitting methods. (Abridged)",2005-02-10T21:49:42Z
"The Nature of the Driving Mechanism in the Pulsating Hybrid PG 1159 Star
  Abell 43","We extend our previous pulsational stability analyses of PG 1159 stars by
modeling the hybrid PG 1159 type star Abell 43. We show that the standard
kappa-mechanism due to the ionization of C and O in the envelope of this H-rich
PG 1159 star is perfectly able to drive g-mode pulsations. Thus, contrary to a
recent suggestion, there is no need to invoke any new or exotic mechanism to
explain the pulsational instabilities observed in this particular star. Our
expected instability band for l = 1 modes extends in period from ~ 2604 s to ~
5529 s, which is consistent with the available photometric observations of
Abell 43. We also suggest that efforts to detect luminosity variations in its
sibling NGC 7094 be pursued.",2005-05-29T16:55:02Z
"Upper limit on the gas density in the Beta-Pictoris system: On the
  effect of gas drag on the dust dynamics","We investigate in this paper the effect of gas drag on the dynamics of the
dust particles in the edge-on Beta-Pictoris disc in order to derive an upper
limit on the mass of gas in this system. Our study is motivated by the large
uncertainties on the amount of gas in the Beta-Pictoris disc currently found in
the literature. The dust particles are assumed to originate from a colliding
annulus of planetesimals peaked around 100AU from the central star as proposed
by Augereau et al.(2001). We consider the various gas densities that have been
inferred from independent observing techniques and we discuss their impact on
the dust dynamics and on the disc profile in scattered light along the
midplane. We show that the observed scattered light profile of the disc cannot
be properly reproduced if hydrogen gas number density at 117AU exceeds 10**4
cm**-3. This corresponds to an upper limit on the total gas mass of about 0.4
Mearth assuming the gas density profile inferred by Brandeker et al.(2004) and
thus to a gas to dust mass ratio smaller than 1. Our approach therefore
provides an independent diagnostic for a gas depletion in the Beta-Pictoris
system relative to the dust disc. Such an approach could also be used to
constrain the gas content of recently identified systems like the edge-on disc
around AUmic.",2005-02-22T12:15:24Z
Progenitors of Core-Collapse Supernovae,"The progenitors of core-collapse supernovae are stars with an initial mass
greater than about 8M(sun). Understanding the evolution of these stars is
necessary to comprehend the evolution and differences between supernovae.
  We have constructed new and unique opacity tables to increase model accuracy
during the latest stages of stellar evolution. We have investigated how initial
mass, initial composition and mass loss affects the progenitors and their
populations. There are many prescriptions for mass loss. Different research
groups use their preferred rates. We have compared 12 different prescriptions
and determined which provides the best fit to observations. We use our
preferred mass-loss scheme to make suggestions as to the source of the
differences between supernova types from our progenitor models.
  Binary evolution is considered in order to search for low luminosity SN
progenitors and progenitor types not possible from single stars. Removal of the
hydrogen envelope is more common and we find quite different hydrogen deficient
SN progenitors. We discuss the implications of our binary models for
ultra-luminous X-ray sources and gamma-ray bursts. We present an estimation of
the mass distribution for black holes at various metallcities showing that
massive black holes are not formed until very low metallicities. Finally we
combine the single star and binary results to determine their relative
populations and compare to observations. However it is not possible to draw
many firm conclusions because of the uncertainty in observations to date.",2005-02-02T18:27:19Z
"Elastic alpha-scattering of 112Sn and 124Sn at astrophysically relevant
  energies","The cross sections for the elastic scattering reactions
{112,124}Sn(a,a){112,124}Sn at energies above and below the Coulomb barrier are
presented and compared to predictions for global alpha-nucleus potentials. The
high precision of the new data allows a study of the global alpha-nucleus
potentials at both the proton and neutron-rich sides of an isotopic chain. In
addition, local alpha-nucleus potentials have been extracted for both nuclei,
and used to reproduce elastic scattering data at higher energies. Predictions
from the capture cross section of the reaction 112Sn(a,g)116Te at
astrophysically relevant energies are presented and compared to experimental
data.",2005-05-27T14:43:37Z
"Extremely Luminous Water Vapor Emission from a Type 2 Quasar at Redshift
  z = 0.66","A search for water masers in 47 Sloan Digital Sky Survey Type 2 quasars using
the Green Bank Telescope has yielded a detection at a redshift of z = 0.660.
This maser is more than an order of magnitude higher in redshift than any
previously known and, with a total isotropic luminosity of 23,000 L_sun, also
the most powerful. The presence and detectability of water masers in quasars at
z ~ 0.3-0.8 may provide a better understanding of quasar molecular tori and
disks, as well as fundamental quasar and galaxy properties such as black hole
masses. Water masers at cosmologically interesting distances may also
eventually provide, via direct distance determinations, a new cosmological
observable for testing the reality and properties of dark energy, currently
inferred primarily through Type 1a supernova measurements.",2005-06-10T19:33:38Z
The cool atmospheres of the binary brown dwarf eps Indi B,"We have imaged $\epsilon$ Indi B, the closest brown dwarf binary known, with
VISIR at the VLT in three narrow-band mid-infrared bandpasses located around
8.6$\mu$m, 10.5$\mu$m and 11.3$\mu$m. We are able to spatially resolve both
components, and determine accurate mid-infrared photometry for both components
independently. In particular, our VISIR observations probe the NH$_3$ feature
in the atmospheres of the cooler and warmer brown dwarfs. For the first time,
we can disentangle the contributions of the two components, and find that % our
photometry of $\epsilon$ IndiBb is in good agreement with recent ``cloud-free''
atmosphere models having an effective temperature of $T_\mathrm{eff}=800$ K.
With an assumed age of 1 Gyr for the $\epsilon$ Indi system, component Ba
agrees more with $T_\mathrm{eff} \approx 1100$ K rather than with
$T_\mathrm{eff}=1200$ K, as suggested by SPITZER spectroscopic observations of
the combined $\epsilon$ Indi B system (Roellig et al., 2004). Even higher
effective temperatures appear inconsistent with our absolute photometry, as
they would imply an unphysical small size of the brown dwarf $\epsilon$ IndiBa.",2005-03-14T17:04:06Z
"No evidence of ""gray"" dust from composite quasar spectra","Two recent studies based on composite reddened quasar spectra have indicated
the presence of `gray' dust in quasar environments. This gray dust has a
relatively flat extinction law in the UV, consistent with the theoretical
expectation of a lack of small dust grains close to a quasar. In contrast,
individual reddened quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey tend to have steep
extinction laws in the UV, similar to that in the SMC. We analyze the method
used in determining extinction laws from composite quasar spectra in order to
resolve this discrepancy. We show that quasars reddened by SMC-type dust that
are present in quasar samples have a negative correlation between E_{B-V} and
redshift, due to selection effects. The fact that the highest redshift quasars
(which contribute to the UV part of a composite spectrum) are less extincted
leads to shallower extinction in the UV. We construct a composite quasar
spectrum from a simulated sample of quasars reddened by SMC-type dust and show
that the extinction curve derived from the composite does not recover the
intrinsic extinction law. We conclude there is no evidence of gray dust in
quasar environments.",2005-05-20T16:05:15Z
HST/WFPC2 morphologies and bar structures of field galaxies at 0.4<z<1,"To address how the galaxy Hubble sequence is established and what physical
processes are involved, we studied morphological properties and internal
structures of field galaxies in the past (0.4<z<1). In addition to structural
parameters derived from bulge+disk decomposition, Zheng et al. (2004)
introduced color maps in recognizing galaxies and properly classified
morphologies of 36 luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs, Lir(8-1000um)>=10^11
L_sun). Here we presented morphological classification of a parallel 75
non-LIRG sample. Our examination revealed that a significant fraction of the
galaxies shows remarkable morphological evolution, most likely related to the
present-day spiral galaxies. Comparison of the morphological properties between
LIRGs and non-LIRGs shows that the LIRGs contain a higher fraction of ongoing
major mergers and systems with signs of merging/interaction. This suggests that
the merging process is one of the major mechanisms to trigger star formation.
We found that spiral LIRGs probably host much fewer bars than spiral non-LIRGs,
suggesting that a bar is not efficient in triggering violent star formation.
Differing from Abraham et al. (1999), no dramatic change of the bar frequency
is detected up to redshift ~0.8. The bar frequency of the distant spirals is
similar to (and may be higher than) the present-day spirals in the rest-frame
$B$ band. We conclude that bar-driven secular evolution is not a major
mechanism to drive morphological evolution of field galaxies, especially their
bulge formation, which is more likely related to multiple intense star
formation episodes during which the galaxies appear as LIRGs (Hammer et al.
2005).",2005-02-08T21:00:48Z
"Photodissociation of water in crystalline ice: a molecular dynamics
  study","Ultraviolet irradiation of ice is of great interest for understanding the
chemistry in both atmospheric and astrophysical environments. In interstellar
space, photodissociation of H2O molecules can be a driving force behind the
chemistry on icy dust grains in dense, cold molecular clouds even though the
flux of UV photons is extremely low. The mechanisms of such photoinduced
processes are poorly understood, however. In this work the photodissociation
dynamics of a water molecule in crystalline ice at 10 K is studied
computationally using classical molecular dynamics. Photodissociation in the
first bilayer leads mainly to H atoms desorbing (65%), while in the third
bilayer trapping of H and OH dominates (51%). The kinetic energy distribution
of the desorbing H atoms is much broader than that for the corresponding
gas-phase photodissociation. The H atoms on average move 11 Angstroms before
becoming trapped, while OH radicals typically move 2 Angstroms. In accordance
with experiments a blueshift of the absorption spectrum is obtained relative to
gas-phase water.",2005-05-31T12:36:55Z
An XMM-Newton observation of Mrk 3 - a Seyfert galaxy just over the edge,"A 100ks XMM-Newton observation of the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy Mrk 3 offers a
unique opportunity to explore the complexity of its X-ray spectrum. We find the
\~3-8 keV continuum to be dominated by reflection from cold matter, with
fluorescent K-shell lines detected from Ni, Fe, Ca, Ar, S, Si and Mg. At higher
energies an intrinsic power law continuum, with canonical Seyfert 1 photon
index, is seen through a near-Compton-thick cold absorber. A soft excess below
\~3 keV is found to be dominated by line emission from an outflow of `warm'
gas, photo-ionised and photo-excited by the intrinsically strong X-ray
continuum. Measured blue-shifts in the strong Fe K-alpha and OVII and VIII
emission lines are discussed in terms of the properties of the putative
molecular torus and ionised outflow.",2005-04-14T15:25:55Z
Symmetric hyperbolic Euler equations for relativistic perfect fluids,"The Euler equations governing a relativistic perfect fluid are put into

"Forward modeling of stellar coronae: from a 3D MHD model to synthetic
  EUV spectra","A forward model is described in which we synthesize spectra from an ab-initio
3D MHD simulation of an outer stellar atmosphere, where the coronal heating is
based on braiding of magnetic flux due to photospheric footpoint motions. We
discuss the validity of assumptions such as ionization equilibrium and
investigate the applicability of diagnostics like the differential emission
measure inversion. We find that the general appearance of the synthesized
corona is similar to the solar corona and that, on a statistical basis,
integral quantities such as average Doppler shifts or differential emission
measures are reproduced remarkably well. The persistent redshifts in the
transition region, which have puzzled theorists since their discovery, are
explained by this model as caused by the flows induced by the heating through
braiding of magnetic flux. While the model corona is only slowly evolving in
intensity, as is observed, the amount of structure and variability in Doppler
shift is very large. This emphasizes the need for fast coronal spectroscopy, as
the dynamical response of the corona to the heating process manifests itself in
a comparably slow evolving coronal intensity but rapid changes in Doppler
shift.",2005-03-16T12:59:43Z
On the evidence for discs around Blue Straggler stars,"Recent observations of blue stragglers by De Marco et al. (2004) have
revealed continuum deficits on the blue side of the Balmer discontinuity,
leading these authors to infer the presence of discs around the stars. This
intriguing possibility may throw light on aspects of the mechanisms responsible
for at least some of these objects; current theories of blue straggler
formation invoke stellar collisions or interacting binaries, both of which
appear capable of forming a circumstellar disc.
  However, by synthesizing photospheric spectra for models of rotating blue
stragglers, we demonstrate that the Balmer jump enhancements can be wholly
attributed to the influence of oblateness and gravity darkening on the
formation of the continuum. Therefore, we are led to conclude that the
observations of De Marco et al. can be ascribed a more prosaic explanation,
that of rapid stellar rotation arising from the merger/interaction formation
process.",2005-03-21T11:16:05Z
Early structure in LCDM,"We use a novel technique to simulate the growth of the most massive
progenitor of a protocluster region from redshift z~80, when its mass was about
10 Msun until the present day. Our nested sequence of N-body resimulations
allows us to study in detail the structure both of the dark matter object
itself and of its environment. Our effective resolution is optimal at redshifts
of 49, 29, 12, 5 and 0 when the dominant object has mass 1.2e5, 5e7, 2e10, 3e12
and 8e14 Msun/hrespectively, and contains ~1e6 simulation particles within its
virial radius. Extended Press-Schechter theory correctly predicts both this
rapid growth and the substantial overabundance of massive haloes we find at
early times in regions surrounding the dominant object. Although the
large-scale structure in these regions differs dramatically from a scaled
version of its present-day counterpart, the internal structure of the dominant
object is remarkably similar. Molecular hydrogen cooling could start as early
as z~49 in this object, while cooling by atomic hydrogen becomes effective at
z~39. If the first stars formed in haloes with virial temperature ~2000, their
comoving abundance by z=49 would be similar to that of dwarf galaxies today,
while their comoving correlation length would be ~2.5Mpc/h.",2005-03-01T17:35:49Z
A QED Model for Non-thermal Emission from SGRs and AXPs,"Previously, we showed that, owing to effects arising from quantum
electrodynamics (QED), magnetohydrodynamic fast modes of sufficient strength
will break down to form electron-positron pairs while traversing the
magnetospheres of strongly magnetised neutron stars. The bulk of the energy of
the fast mode fuels the development of an electron-positron fireball. However,
a small, but potentially observable, fraction of the energy ($\sim 10^{33}$
ergs) can generate a non-thermal distribution of electrons and positrons far
from the star. In this paper, we examine the cooling and radiative output of
these particles. We also investigate the properties of non-thermal emission in
the absence of a fireball to understand the breakdown of fast modes that do not
yield an optically thick pair plasma. This quiescent, non-thermal radiation
associated with fast mode breakdown may account for the recently observed
non-thermal emission from several anomalous X-ray pulsars and soft-gamma
repeaters.",2005-02-17T14:19:36Z
Energetics in MRI driven Turbulence,"In these proceedings we present recent efforts to understand the energetics
of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational
instability (MRI). These studies are carried out in the local (shearing box)
approximation using the Athena simulation code. Athena is a higher order
Godunov algorithm based on the piecewise parabolic method (PPM), the corner
transport upwind (CTU) integration algorithm, and the constrained transport
(CT) algorithm for evolving the magnetic field. This algorithm is particularly
suited for these studies owing to the conservation properties of a Godunov
scheme and the particular implementation of the shearing box source terms used
here. We present a variety of calculations which may be compared directly to
previously published results and discuss them in some detail. The only
significant discrepancy found between the results presented here and in the
published literature involves the turbulent heating rate. We observe the
presence of recurrent channel solutions in calculations involving a mean
vertical magnetic field and the associated time lag between the energy
injection and thermalization rate. We also present the results of a shearing
box calculation which includes an optically thin radiative term with a cooling
rate selected to match the turbulent heating rate. Some properties which we
find uniformly present in all of the calculations presented here are
compressible fluctuations, spiral waves and weak shocks. It is found that these
compressible modes dominate the temporal fluctuations in the probability
distribution functions for most of the thermodynamic variables; only the
specific entropy is relatively immune to their effects.",2005-02-24T20:13:40Z
"Diagnostics of irradiated gas in galaxy nuclei. I: A Far-ultraviolet and
  X-ray dominated region code","We present a far-ultraviolet (PDR) and an X-ray dominated region (XDR) code.
We include and discuss thermal and chemical processes that pertain to
irradiated gas. An elaborate chemical network is used and a careful treatment
of PAHs and H2 formation, destruction and excitation is included. For both
codes we calculate four depth-dependent models for different densities and
radiation fields, relevant to conditions in starburst galaxies and active
galactic nuclei. A detailed comparison between PDR and XDR physics is made for
total gas column densities between ~10^20 and ~10^25 cm^-2. We show cumulative
line intensities for a number of fine-structure lines (e.g., [CII], [OI], [CI],
[SiII], [FeII]), as well as cumulative column densities and column density
ratios for a number of species (e.g., CO/H2, CO/C, HCO+/HCN, HNC/HCN). The
comparison between the results for the PDRs and XDRs shows that column density
ratios are almost constant up to N_H=10^22 cm^-2 for XDRs, unlike those in
PDRs. For example, CO/C in PDRs changes over four orders of magnitude from the
edge to N_H=10^22 cm^-2. The CO/C and CO/H2 ratios are lower in XDRs at low
column densities and rise at N_H > 10^23 cm^-2. At most column densities N_H >
10^21.5 cm^-2, HNC/HCN ratios are lower in XDRs too, but they show a more
moderate increase at higher N_H.",2005-02-22T12:48:03Z
Particle Effects on the ISGRI Instrument On-Board the INTEGRAL Satellite,"The INTEGRAL satellite was launched on October 17, 2002. All on-board
instruments are operating successfully. In this paper, we focus on radiation
effects on the Cadmium Telluride camera ISGRI. The spectral response of the
camera is affected by cosmic particles depositing huge amount of energy,
greater than the high threshold of the electronics. Our study raises the
contribution of cosmic ray protons. Solutions are proposed to limit the
degradation of spectral response of large pixel gamma cameras operating in
space.",2005-05-03T12:02:59Z
A New View of the Circumstellar Environment of SN 1987A,"We summarize the analysis of a uniform set of both previously-known and
newly-discovered scattered-light echoes, detected within 30"" of SN 1987A in ten
years of optical imaging, and with which we have constructed the most complete
three-dimensional model of the progenitor's circumstellar environment.
Surrounding the SN is a richly-structured bipolar nebula. An outer,
double-lobed ``peanut,'' which we believe is the contact discontinuity between
the red supergiant and main sequence winds, is a prolate shell extending 28 ly
along the poles and 11 ly near the equator. Napoleon's Hat, previously believed
to be an independent structure, is the waist of this peanut, which is pinched
to a radius of 6 ly. Interior, the innermost circumstellar material lies along
a cylindrical hourglass, 1 ly in radius and 4 ly long, which connects to the
peanut by a thick equatorial disk. The nebulae are inclined 41o south and 8o
east of the line of sight, slightly elliptical in cross section, and marginally
offset west of the SN. The 3-D geometry of the three circumstellar rings is
studied, suggesting the equatorial ring is elliptical (b/a<0.98), and spatially
offset in the same direction as the hourglass. Dust-scattering models suggest
that between the hourglass and bipolar lobes: the gas density drops from 1--3
cm^{-3} to >0.03 cm^{-3}; the maximum dust-grain size increases from ~0.2
micron to 2 micron; and the Si:C dust ratio decreases. The nebulae have a total
mass of ~1.7 Msun, yielding a red-supergiant mass loss around 5*10^{-6} Msun
yr^{-1}.",2005-02-14T17:29:56Z
Observations of the BL Lac Object 3C 66A with STACEE,"We present the analysis and results of recent high-energy gamma-ray
observations of the BL Lac object 3C 66A conducted with the Solar Tower
Atmospheric Cherenkov Effect Experiment (STACEE). During the 2003-2004
observing season, STACEE extensively observed 3C 66A as part of a
multiwavelength campaign on the source. A total of 33.7 hours of data was taken
on the source, plus an equivalent-duration background observation. After
cleaning the data set a total of 16.3 hours of live time remained, and a net
on-source excess of 1134 events was seen against a background of 231742 events.
At a significance of 2.2 standard deviations this excess is insufficient to
claim a detection of 3C 66A, but is used to establish flux upper limits for the
source.",2005-04-23T03:09:53Z
"The 24 micron Luminosity Function of spectroscopic SWIRE sources from
  the Lockman validation field","A spectroscopic follow-up of SWIRE sources from the Lockman Validation Field
has allowed the determination of the SWIRE 24 micron Luminosity Function (LF).
The spectroscopic sample was chosen above a 24 micron flux limit at 260 microJy
and an r-band optical limit of r<21. A spectroscopic completeness of 82.5% was
achieved. We found the median redshift for the sample to be z_med=0.29.
Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) and Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE)
techniques were employed to fit a parametric LF. Our result of the local LF
(LLF) is consistent with the local 25 micron determination from Shupe et al.
1998. We split the sample at a redshift of z_split=0.36 and find strong
evidence for galaxy evolution.",2005-03-21T15:59:08Z
The evolution of X-ray emission in young stars,"We study the relation between age and magnetic activity in late-type pre-main
sequence (PMS) stars, for the first time using mass-stratified subsamples. The
effort is based on the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP) which provides
very sensitive and homogenous X-ray data on a uniquely large sample of 481
optically well-characterized low-extinction low-mass members of the Orion
Nebula Cluster, for which individual stellar masses and ages could be
determined. More than 98 percent of the stars in this sample are detected as
X-ray sources. Within the PMS phase for stellar ages in the range $\sim 0.1-10$
Myr, we establish a mild decay in activity with stellar age $\tau$ roughly as
$L_{\rm X} \propto \tau^{-1/3}$. On longer timescales, when the Orion stars are
compared to main sequence stars, the X-ray luminosity decay law for stars in
the $0.5 < M < 1.2$ M$_\odot$ mass range is more rapid with $L_{\rm X} \propto
\tau^{-0.75}$ over the wide range of ages $5 < \log \tau < 9.5$ yr. The
magnetic activity history for M stars with masses $0.1 < M < 0.4 M_\odot$ is
distinctly different. Only a mild decrease in X-ray luminosity, and even a mild
increase in $L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm bol}$ and $F_{\rm X}$, is seen over the 1-100 Myr
range, though the X-ray emission does decay over long timescales on the main
sequence. Together with COUP results on the absence of a rotation-activity
relation in Orion stars, we find that the activity-age decay is strong across
the entire history of solar-type stars but is not attributable to rotational
deceleration during the early epochs. A combination of tachocline and
distributed convective dynamos may be operative in young solar-type stars. The
results for the lowest mass stars are most easily understood by the dominance
of convective dynamos during both the PMS and main sequence phases.",2005-06-02T10:31:44Z
The stability of decelerating shocks revisited,"We present a new method for analyzing the global stability of the Sedov-von
Neumann-Taylor self-similar solutions, describing the asymptotic behavior of
spherical decelerating shock waves, expanding into ideal gas with density
\propto r^{-\omega}. Our method allows to overcome the difficulties associated
with the non-physical divergences of the solutions at the origin. We show that
while the growth rates of global modes derived by previous analyses are
accurate in the large wave number (small wavelength) limit, they do not
correctly describe the small wave number behavior for small values of the
adiabatic index \gamma. Our method furthermore allows to analyze the stability
properties of the flow at early times, when the flow deviates significantly
from the asymptotic self-similar behavior. We find that at this stage the
perturbation growth rates are larger than those obtained for unstable
asymptotic solutions at similar [\gamma,\omega]. Our results reduce the
discrepancy that exists between theoretical predictions and experimental
results.",2005-02-06T12:17:08Z
"Exploring Halo Substructure with Giant Stars: The Velocity Dispersion
  Profiles of the Ursa Minor and Draco Dwarf Spheroidals At Large Angular
  Separations","We analyze velocity dispersion profiles for the Draco and Ursa Minor (UMi)
dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies based on published and new Keck HIRES spectra
for stars in the outer UMi field. Washington+DDO51 filter photometric catalogs
provide additional leverage on membership of individual stars, and beyond 0.5
King limiting radii (R_lim) identify bona fide dSph members up to 4.5 times
more efficiently than simple color-magnitude diagram selections. Previously
reported ``cold populations'' R_lim are not obvious in the data and appear only
with particular binning; more or less constant and platykurtic dispersion
profiles are characteristic of these dSphs to large radii. We report discovery
of UMi stars to at least 2.7 R_lim (i.e.,210 arcmin or 4 kpc). Even with
conservative assumptions, a UMi mass of M > 4.9 x 10^8 M_(sun) is required to
bind these stars, implying an unlikely global mass-to-light ratio of M/L > 900
(M/L)_(sun). We conclude that we have found stars tidally stripped from UMi.",2005-04-01T19:59:30Z
The Hubble Slow Roll Expansion for Multi Field Inflation,"We examine the dynamics of inflation driven by multiple, interacting scalar
fields and derive a multi field version of the Hubble slow roll expansion. We
show that the properties of this expansion naturally generalize those of the
single field case. We present an analogous hierarchy of slow roll parameters,
and derive the system of ``flow'' equations that describes their evolution, and
show that when this system is truncated at finite order, it can always be
solved exactly. Lastly, we express the scalar and tensor perturbation spectra
in terms of the slow roll parameters.",2005-05-02T19:12:53Z
"The same physics underlying SGRs, AXPs, and radio pulsars","Unexpected sign, significant magnitude and time-variation of frequency second
derivative exist not only in singular radio pulsars but also in Soft Gamma
repeaters (SGRs) and Anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs). This paper shows that the
these phenomena are related, and can be interpreted by a simple unified model,
long-term orbital effect. Thus many of previous ``isolated'' pulsars may be
binary pulsars, i.e., orbital period
  $P_b\approx(47, 72)$min for AXP 1E 2259+586, and $P_b\approx (20, 34)$min for
PSR J1614-5047, $P_b\approx (3.6, 6.4)$min for SGR 1900+14, and $P_b\approx
(1.5, 5.8)$min for SGR 1806-20. In addition to X-ray pulsar, 1E 1207.4-5209,
these two SGRs may be the new ultra-compact binary pulsars with orbital period
of a few minutes. There might be more binary pulsars that suitable for
gravitational wave detection than we had thought.",2005-04-07T03:07:10Z
"Sub-arcsec imaging of the AB Aur molecular disk and envelope at
  millimeter wavelengths: a non Keplerian disk","We present sub-arcsecond images of AB Auriga obtained with the IRAM Plateau
de Bure interferometer in the isotopologues of CO, and in continuum at 3 and
1.3 mm. Instead of being centrally peaked, the continuum emission is dominated
by a bright, asymmetric (spiral-like) feature at about 140 AU from the central
star. The large scale molecular structure suggests the AB Aur disk is inclined
between 23 and 43 degrees, but the strong asymmetry of the continuum and
molecular emission prevents an accurate determination of the inclination of the
inner parts. We find significant non-Keplerian motion, with a best fit exponent
for the rotation velocity law of 0.41 +/- 0.01, but no evidence for radial
motions. The disk has an inner hole about 70 AU in radius. The disk is warm and
shows no evidence of depletion of CO. The dust properties suggest the dust is
less evolved than in typical T Tauri disks. Both the spiral-like feature and
the departure from purely Keplerian motions indicates the AB Aur disk is not in
quasi-equilibrium. Disk self-gravity is insufficient to create the
perturbation. This behavior may be related either to an early phase of star
formation in which the Keplerian regime is not yet fully established and/or to
a disturbance of yet unknown origin. An alternate, but unproven, possibility is
that of a low mass companion located about 40 AU from AB Aur.",2005-04-01T14:06:30Z
"GRS 1915+105: the distance, radiative processes and energy-dependent
  variability","We present an exhaustive analysis of five broad-band observations of GRS
1915+105 in two variability states, chi and omega, observed simultaneously by
the PCA, HEXTE and OSSE. We find all the spectra well fitted by Comptonization
of disc blackbody photons, with very strong evidence for the presence of a
nonthermal electron component in the Comptonizing plasma. Both the energy and
the power spectra in the chi state are typical to the very high/intermediate
state of black-hole binaries. The spectrum of the omega state is characterized
by a strong blackbody component Comptonized by thermal electrons and a weak
nonthermal tail. We then calculate rms spectra (fractional variability as
functions of energy) for the PCA data. We accurately model the rms spectra by
coherent superposition of variability in the components implied by the spectral
fits, namely a less variable blackbody and more variable Comptonization. The
latter dominates at high energies, resulting in a flattening of the rms at high
energies in most of the data. This is also the case for the spectra of the QPOs
present in the chi state. Then, some of our data require a radial dependence of
the rms of the disc blackbody. We also study the distance to the source, and
find 11 kpc as the most likely value, contrary to a recent claim of a much
lower value.",2005-04-01T10:00:03Z
"Exploring the Structure of Galaxy Clusters: XMM-Newton observations of
  the REFLEX-DXL clusters at z~0.3","The precise determination of global properties of galaxy clusters, and their
scaling relations, is a task of prime importance for the use of clusters as
cosmological probes. We performed a detailed XMM-Newton study of 14 X-ray
luminous REFLEX Survey clusters at z~0.3. We found that the properties of the
galaxy clusters show a self-similar behavior at r>0.1r_{vir}. This helps to
establish tighter scaling relations. Peculiarities in the individual clusters
are important to understand the scatter from the self-similar frame in the
cluster central parts.",2005-02-09T17:58:00Z
Search for Planetary Candidates within the OGLE Stars,"We propose a method to distinguish between planetary and stellar companions
to stars which present a periodic decrease in brightness, interpreted as a
transit. Light curves from a total of 177 stars from the OGLE project were
fitted by the model which simulates planetary transits using an opaque disk in
front of an image of the Sun. The simulation results yield the orbital radius
in units of stellar radii, the orbital inclination angle, and the ratio of the
planet to the star radii. Combining Kepler's third law with a mass-radius
relation for main sequence stars, it was possible to estimate values for the
masses and radii of both the primary and secondary objects. This model was
successfully tested with the confirmed planets orbiting the stars HD 209458,
TrES-1, OGLE-TR-10, 56, 111, 113, and 132. The method consists of selecting as
planetary candidates only those objects with primary densities between 0.7 and
2.3 solar densities (F, G, and K stars) and secondaries with radius less than
1.5 Jupiter radius. The method is not able to distinguish between a planet and
a dwarf star with mass less than 0.1 $M_\odot$, such as OGLE-TR-122. We propose
a selection of 28 planetary candidates (OGLE-TR-49, 51, 55, 63, 71, 76, 90, 97,
100, 109, 114, 127, 130, 131, 134, 138, 140, 146, 151, 155, 159, 164, 165, 169,
170, 171, 172, and 174) for high resolution spectroscopy follow up.",2005-05-13T12:04:38Z
"Bulk Comptonization of the Cosmic Microwave Background by Extragalactic
  Jets as a Probe of their Matter Content","We propose a method for estimating the composition, i.e. the relative amounts
of leptons and protons, of extragalactic jets which exhibit X-ray bright knots
in their kpc scale jets. The method relies on measuring, or setting upper
limits on, the component of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation
that is bulk-Comptonized by cold electrons in the relativistically flowing jet.
These measurements, along with modeling of the broadband knot emission that
constrain the bulk Lorentz factor of the jets, can yield estimates of the jet
power carried by protons and leptons. We provide an explicit calculation of the
spectrum of the bulk-Comptonized (BC) CMB component and apply these results to
PKS 0637--752 and 3C 273, two superluminal quasars with Chandra-detected large
scale jets. What makes these sources particularly suited for such a procedure
is the absence of significant non-thermal jet emission in the `bridge', the
region between the core and the first bright jet knot, which guarantees that
most of the electrons are cold there, leaving the BC scattered CMB radiation as
the only significant source of photons in this region. At lambda=3.6-8.0
microns the most likely band to observe the BC scattered CMB emission, the
Spitzer angular resolution (~ 1''-3) is considerably smaller than the `bridges'
of these jets (~10''), making it possible to both measure and resolve this
emission.",2005-02-09T20:57:39Z
"Baryogenesis and CP-Violating Domain Walls in the Background of a
  Magnetic Field","Within the domain wall-mediated electroweak baryogenesis, we study fermion
scattering off a CP-violating wall in the background of an uniform magnetic
field. In particular, we calculate the asymmetry between the reflection
coefficients for right-handed and left-handed chiral fermions, \Delta R = R_{R
\to L} - R_{L \to R}, which is of relevance to non local baryogenesis
mechanisms.",2005-05-26T11:04:20Z
An Unusual System of HI Filaments near WR 5 and HD 17603,"We report the discovery of a system of unusual HI filaments which appear to
be associated with molecular clouds in the Perseus spiral arm of our Galaxy. We
investigate the hypothesis that this system is the result of a directed flow of
dissociated gas from clouds trapped within an extended wind flow from massive
stars. The Wolf-Rayet star WR 5 and the OIb(f) star HD 17603 are identified as
candidate driving sources. However, an examination of this hypothesis within
the context of the theory of mass-loaded winds shows that these two stars alone
cannot account for the energetics and kinematics of the required spherically
symmetric wind flow. Unless the apparent association between HI, molecular gas,
and stars is an accidental one, we suggest that other as-yet unidentified stars
must have contributed to driving the filaments.",2005-05-18T19:57:00Z
Similarity theory of stellar models and structure of very massive stars,"The similarity theory of stellar structure is used to study the properties of
very massive stars when one can neglect all the sources of opacity except for
the Thomson scattering. The dimensionless internal structure of such stars is
practically independent of the energy generation law.
  It is shown that the mass-luminosity relation can be approximated by an
analytical expression which is virtually universal regarding the chemical
composition and energy generation law. A detailed comparison with the
  Eddington standard model is given. The application of the obtained results to
the observations of massive stars is briefly discussed.",2005-05-03T13:29:41Z
XMM-Newton and Gemini Observations of Eight RASSCALS Galaxy Groups,"We study the distribution of gas pressure and entropy in eight groups of
galaxies belonging to the ROSAT All-Sky Survey / Center for Astrophysics Loose
Systems (RASSCALS). We use archival and proprietary XMM-Newton observations,
supplementing the X-ray data with redshifts derived from the literature; we
also list 127 new redshifts measured with the Gemini North telescope. The
groups show remarkable self-similarity in their azimuthally averaged entropy
and temperature profiles. The entropy increases with radius; the behavior of
the entropy profiles is consistent with an increasing broken power law with
inner and outer slope 0.92+0.04-0.05 and 0.42+0.05-0.04 (68% confidence),
respectively. There is no evidence of a central, isentropic core, and the
entropy distribution in most of the groups is flatter at large radii than in
the inner region, challenging earlier reports as well as theoretical models
predicting large isentropic cores or asymptotic slopes of 1.1 at large radii.
The pressure profiles are consistent with a self-similar decreasing broken
power law in radius; the inner and outer slopes are -0.78+0.04-0.03 and
-1.7+0.1-0.3, respectively. The results suggest that the larger scatter in the
entropy distribution reflects the varied gasdynamical histories of the groups;
the regularity and self-similarity of the pressure profiles is a sign of a
similarity in the underlying dark matter distributions.",2005-02-18T01:39:25Z
Metal Enrichment Processes in the Intra-Cluster Medium,"We present numerical simulations of galaxy clusters which include interaction
processes between the galaxies and the intra-cluster gas. The considered
interaction processes are galactic winds and ram-pressure stripping, which both
transfer metal-enriched interstellar medium into the intra-cluster gas and
hence increase its metallicity. We investigate the efficiency and time
evolution of the interaction processes by simulated metallicity maps, which are
directly comparable to those obtained from X-ray observations. We find that
ram-pressure stripping is more efficient than quiet (i.e. non-starburst driven)
galactic winds in the redshift interval between 1 and 0. The expelled metals
are not mixed immediately with the intra-cluster gas, but inhomogeneities are
visible in the metallicity maps. Even stripes of higher metallicity that a
single galaxy has left behind can be seen. The spatial distribution of the
metals transported by ram-pressure stripping and by galactic winds are very
different for massive clusters: the former process yields a centrally
concentrated metal distribution while the latter results in an extended metal
distribution.",2005-04-04T14:29:29Z
CLASS B0631+519: Last of the CLASS lenses,"We report the discovery of a new gravitational lens system from the CLASS
survey, CLASS B0631+519. VLA, MERLIN and VLBA observations show a doubly-imaged
radio core, a doubly-imaged lobe and a second lobe that is probably
quadruply-imaged. The maximum image separation is 1.16 arcseconds. The VLBA
resolves the most magnified image of the flat-spectrum radio core into a number
of sub-components spread across approximately 20 milli-arcseconds. Optical and
near-infrared imaging with the ACS and NICMOS cameras on the HST show that
there are two galaxies along the line of sight to the lensed source, as was
previously discovered by optical spectroscopy. The nearer galaxy at z=0.0896 is
a small blue irregular, while the more distant galaxy at z=0.6196 is an
elliptical type and appears to contribute most of the lensing effect. The host
galaxy of the lensed source is visible in NICMOS imaging as a set of arcs that
form an almost complete Einstein ring. Mass modelling using non-parametric
techniques can reproduce the ring and indicates that the irregular galaxy has a
(localised) effect on the flux density distribution in the Einstein ring at the
5-10% level.",2005-05-05T17:30:01Z
The Differential Lifetimes of Protostellar Gas and Dust Disks,"We construct a protostellar disk model that takes into account the combined
effect of viscous evolution, photoevaporation and the differential radial
motion of dust grains and gas. For T Tauri disks, the lifetimes of dust disks
that are mainly composed of millimeter sized grains are always shorter than the
gas disks' lifetimes, and become similar only when the grains are fluffy
(density < 0.1 g cm^{-3}). If grain growth during the classical T Tauri phase
produces plenty of millimeter sized grains, such grains completely accrete onto
the star in 10^7 yr, before photoevaporation begins to drain the inner gas disk
and the star evolves to the weak line T Tauri phase. In the weak line phase,
only dust-poor gas disks remain at large radii (> 10 AU), without strong signs
of gas accretion nor of millimeter thermal emission from the dust. For Herbig
AeBe stars, the strong photoevaporation clears the inner disks in 10^6 yr,
before the dust grains in the outer disk migrate to the inner region. In this
case, the grains left behind in the outer gas disk accumulate at the disk inner
edge (at 10-100 AU from the star). The dust grains remain there even after the
entire gas disk has been photoevaporated, and form a gas-poor dust ring similar
to that observed around HR 4796A. Hence, depending on the strength of the
stellar ionizing flux, our model predicts opposite types of products around
young stars. For low mass stars with a low photoevaporation rate, dust-poor gas
disks with an inner hole would form, whereas for high mass stars with a high
photoevaporation rate, gas-poor dust rings would form. This prediction should
be examined by observations of gas and dust around weak line T Tauri stars and
evolved Herbig AeBe stars.",2005-03-22T06:16:04Z
"Spectral and morphological properties of quasar hosts in SPH simulations
  of AGN feeding by mergers","We present a method for generating virtual observations from
smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations. This method includes stellar
population synthesis models and the reprocessing of starlight by dust to
produce realistic galaxy images. We apply this method and simulate the merging
of two identical giant Sa galaxies. The merger remnant is an elliptical galaxy.
The merger concentrates the gas content of the two galaxies into the nuclear
region. The gas that flows into the nuclear region refuels the central black
holes of the merging galaxies. We follow the refuelling of the black holes
during the merger semi-analytically.
  In the simulation presented in this article, the black holes grow from 3 x
10^7 to 1.8X 10^8 Solar masses, with a peak AGN luminosity of M_B ~ -23.7. We
study how the morphological and spectral properties of the system evolve during
the merger and work out the predictions of this scenario for the properties of
host galaxies during the active phase. The peak of AGN activity coincides with
the merging of the two galactic nuclei and occurs at a stage when the remnant
looks like a lenticular galaxy. The simulation predicts the formation of a
circumnuclear starburst ring/dusty torus with an opening angle of 30-40 degrees
and made of clouds with n_H=10^24 cm^-2. The average optical depth of the torus
is quite high, but the obscuring medium is patchy, so that there still exist
lines of sight where the AGN is visible in a nearly edge-on view. For the same
reason, there are lines of sight where the AGN is completely obscured in the
face-on view.",2005-04-18T18:39:01Z
On the origin of the drifting subpulses in radio pulsars,"A model for the main observational characteristics of the radio emission of
pulsars with well organized drifting subpulses is presented. We propose that
drifting subpulses result from the modulation of the radio emission mechanism
due to long-wavelength drift waves in the magnetosphere. The drift waves are
generated at shorter wavelengths, and their nonlinear evolution favours
accumulation in a specific azimuthal eigenmode with an integral number, $m$, of
nodes encircling the magnetic pole. The electric field of the drift waves is
along the magnetic field lines, and this modulates the distribution for
particles and hence the radio emission mechanism. The ratio of the frequency of
the eigenmode to the rotation frequency of the star is insensitive to the
magnetic field strength and the period of rotation, and is of order unity. The
period, $P_3$, of the drifting subpulses is attributed to the mismatch between
this frequency and the nearest harmonic of the rotation frequency of the star.",2005-04-02T01:04:57Z
Evolving Dark Energy with w Deviating from -1,"Theories of evolving quintessence are constructed that generically lead to
deviations from the w = -1 prediction of non-evolving dark energy. The small
mass scale that governs evolution, m_\phi \approx 10^{-33} eV, is radiatively
stable, and the ``Why Now?'' problem is solved. These results rest crucially on
seesaw cosmology: in broad outline, fundamental physics and cosmology can be
understood from only two mass scales, the weak scale, v, and the Planck scale,
M. Requiring a scale of dark energy \rho_{DE}^{1/4} governed by v^2/M, and a
radiatively stable evolution rate m_\phi given by v^4/M^3, leads to a
distinctive form for the equation of state w(z) that follows from a cosine
quintessence potential. An explicit hidden axion model is constructed. Dark
energy resides in the potential of the axion field which is generated by a new
QCD-like force that gets strong at the scale \Lambda \approx v^2/M \approx
\rho_{DE}^{1/4}. The evolution rate is given by a second seesaw that leads to
the axion mass, m_\phi \approx \Lambda^2/f, with f \approx M.",2005-03-31T16:41:41Z
The conspicuous gamma-ray burst of 30 May 1996,"The spectra of the majority of bursts exhibit a low-energy power law index,
alpha, that is either a constant or becomes softer with time. However, in the
burst of 30 May 1996 alpha becomes harder. Here we show that this behavior can
be explained by a hybrid model consisting of a thermal and a non-thermal
component. In this burst the power-law index of the non-thermal component
changes drastically from s ~ -1.5 to s ~ -0.67 at approximately 5 seconds after
the trigger, thereby revealing, at low energies, the thermal component with its
hard Rayleigh-Jeans tail. This leads to the large alpha-values that are found
if the Band function is fitted to the spectra. We suggest that the change in s
could be due to a transition from fast to slow cooling of the electrons
emitting in the BATSE range. This could be due to the fact that the magnetic
field strength becomes weaker.",2005-04-25T15:12:07Z
"Large Scale Structure in Bekenstein's theory of relativistic Modified
  Newtonian Dynamics","A relativistic theory of modified gravity has been recently proposed by
Bekenstein. The tensor field in Einstein's theory of gravity is replaced by a
scalar, a vector, and a tensor field which interact in such a way to give
Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) in the weak-field non-relativistic limit. We
study the evolution of the universe in such a theory, identifying its key
properties and comparing it with the standard cosmology obtained in Einstein
gravity. The evolution of the scalar field is akin to that of tracker
quintessence fields. We expand the theory to linear order to find the evolution
of perturbations on large scales. The impact on galaxy distributions and the
cosmic microwave background is calculated in detail. We show that it may be
possible to reproduce observations of the cosmic microwave background and
galaxy distributions with Bekenstein's theory of MOND.",2005-05-26T15:42:19Z
Quantum Electrodynamical Effects in Dusty Plasmas,"A new nonlinear electromagnetic wave mode in a magnetized dusty plasma is
predicted. Its existence depends on the interaction of an intense circularly
polarized electromagnetic wave with a dusty plasma, where quantum
electrodynamical photon-photon scattering is taken into account. Specifically,
we consider a dusty electron-positron-ion plasma, and show that the propagation
of the new mode is admitted. It could be of significance for the physics of
supernova remnants and in neutron star formation.",2005-03-17T12:30:50Z
"Multiplicity Amongst Wide Brown Dwarf Companions to Nearby Stars: Gliese
  337CD","We present Lick Natural Guide Star Adaptive Optics observations of the L8
brown dwarf Gliese 337C, which is resolved for the first time into two closely
separated (0""53+/-0""03), nearly equal magnitude components with a K_s flux
ratio of 0.93+/-0.10. Companionship is inferred from the absence of a 3""6
offset source in 2MASS or photographic plate images, implying that the observed
secondary component is a co-moving late-type dwarf. With a projected separation
of 11 AU and nearly equal-magnitude components, Gliese 337CD has properties
similar to other known companion and field substellar binaries. Its long
orbital period (estimated to be ~140-180 yr) inhibits short-term astrometric
mass measurements, but the Gliese 337CD system is ideal for studying the L/T
transition at a fixed age and metallicity. From a compilation of all known
widely separated (>~100 AU) stellar/brown dwarf multiple systems, we find
evidence that the binary fraction of brown dwarfs in these systems is notably
higher than that of field brown dwarfs, 45(+15)(-13)% versus 18(+7)(-4)% for
analogous samples. We speculate on possible reasons for this difference,
including the possibility that dynamic (ejection) interactions which may form
such wide pairs preferentially retain binary secondaries due to their greater
combined mass and/or ability to absorb angular momentum.",2005-03-17T04:18:00Z
Magnetospheric Eclipses in the Binary Pulsar J0737-3039,"(Abridged) In the binary radio pulsar system J0737-3039, the faster pulsar A
is eclipsed once per orbit. We construct a simple geometric model which
successfully reproduces the eclipse light curves, based on the idea that the
radio pulses are attenuated by synchrotron absorption on the closed magnetic
field lines of pulsar B. The model explains most of the properties of the
eclipse: its asymmetric form, the nearly frequency-independent duration, and
the modulation of the brightness of pulsar A at both once and twice the
rotation frequency of pulsar B in different parts of the eclipse. This detailed
agreement confirms the dipolar structure of the star's poloidal magnetic field.
The model makes clear predictions for the degree of linear polarization of the
transmitted radiation.
  The weak frequency dependence of the eclipse duration implies that the
absorbing plasma is relativistic, with a density much larger than the
corotation charge density. Such hot, dense plasma can be effectively stored in
the outer magnetosphere, where cyclotron cooling is slow. The gradual loss of
particles inward through the cooling radius is compensated by an upward flux
driven by a fluctuating component of the current, and by the pumping of
magnetic helicity on the closed field lines. The trapped particles are heated
to relativistic energies by the damping of magnetospheric turbulence and, at a
slower rate, by the absorption of the radio emission of the companion pulsar.",2005-02-17T20:36:02Z
The Remnants of Intergalactic Supernovae,"Intergalactic type-Ia supernovae (SNe-Ia) have been discovered recently in
rich galaxy clusters, likely the descendants of an intergalactic stellar
population found in recent years through a variety of tracers. We estimate the
observational signatures of the associated SN remnants (SNRs) in the unusual
intracluster medium (ICM) environment. If SNe-Ia still have a circumstellar
medium (CSM) at the time of explosion, then their remnants are visible in the
optical for ~100-1000 years, with properties similar to young galactic SNRs. In
contrast with galactic SNRs, in which the ejecta from the explosion interacts
with the ISM, intracluster SNRs become undetectable in the optical once their
ejecta passes beyond the CSM and enters the hot and tenuous ICM. If SNe-Ia have
a CSM, there should be ~150 young SNRs in the Virgo cluster, with
L(H-alpha)~10^{35} erg/s and angular size ~0.1''. We investigate the
possibility that members of this SNR population may have recently been
detected, but incorrectly identified as intergalactic HII regions.
Alternatively, if optical intergalactic SNRs do not exist in Virgo, this will
be evidence that SNe-Ia are devoid of a CSM, with implications for progenitor
scenarios. Regardless of the presence of a CSM, about 10 older radio SNRs per
square degree should be detectable in Virgo, with fluxes of ~0.1 mJy at 1 GHz.
Their angular sizes, morphologies, and lack of optical association with distant
galaxies can distinguish them from the much more numerous background
population. Their detection would provide a measurement of the intracluster SN
rate. Observations toward the site of SN1980I, a possibly intergalactic Virgo
SN-Ia, can test the existence of a CSM by comparison to our early-time
predictions for intergalactic SNR development.",2005-06-16T09:46:51Z
"Detection of satellite remnants in the Galactic Halo with Gaia - I. The
  effect of the Galactic background, observational errors and sampling","We address the problem of identifying remnants of satellite galaxies in the
halo of our galaxy with Gaia data. The remnants have to be extracted from a
very large data set (of order 10^9 stars) in the presence of observational
errors and against a background population of Galactic stars. We address this
issue through a numerical simulation of the Gaia catalogue with a realistic
number of entries. The Galaxy model includes separate light distributions and
kinematics for the bulge, disc and stellar halo. Our catalogue contains
3.5x10^8 stars. We perform tree code 10^6-body simulations of satellite dwarf
galaxies in orbit around a rigid mass model of the Galaxy. The shrinking
satellite cores and tidal tails are added to the Monte Carlo simulation of the
Gaia catalogue. When combining the Milky Way and dwarf galaxy models we include
the complication that the luminosity function of the satellite is probed at
various depths as a function of position along the tidal tails. The combined
models are converted to a synthetic Gaia catalogue using a detailed model for
the expected astrometric and radial velocity errors, depending on magnitude,
colour and sky position of the stars. We explore the feasibility of detecting
tidal streams in the halo using the energy versus angular momentum plane. A
straightforward search in this plane will be very challenging. The background
population and the observational errors make it difficult to detect tidal
streams as discrete structures in the E-Lz plane. The propagation of
observational errors leads to apparent caustic structures in the integrals of
motion space that may be mistaken for physical entities. Any practical search
strategy will have to use a combination of pre-selection of high-quality data
and complementary searches using the photometric data from Gaia. (abridged)",2005-04-11T14:26:10Z
"New model of angular momentum transfer from the rotating central body of
  a two-body system into the orbital motion of this system (with application to
  the earth-moon system)","In a previous paper we treated within the framework of our Projective Unified
Field Theory (Schmutzer 2004, Schmutzer 2005a) the 2-body system (e.g.
earth-moon system) with a rotating central body in a rather abstract manner.
Here a concrete model of the transfer of angular momentum from the rotating
central body to the orbital motion of the whole 2-body system is presented,
where particularly the transfer is caused by the inhomogeneous gravitational
force of the moon acting on the oceanic waters of the earth, being modeled by a
spherical shell around the solid earth. The theory is numerically tested. Key
words: transfer of angular momentum from earth to moon, action of the
gravitational force of the moon on the waters of the earth.",2005-05-11T07:25:06Z
Gemini Deep Deep Survey VI: Massive Hdelta-strong galaxies at z=1,"We show that there has been a dramatic decline in the abundance of massive
galaxies with strong Hdelta stellar absorption lines from z=1.2 to the present.
These ``Hdelta-strong'', or HDS, galaxies have undergone a recent and rapid
break in their star-formation activity. Combining data from the Gemini Deep
Deep and the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys to make mass-matched samples
(M*>=10^10.2 Msun), with 25 and 50,255 galaxies, respectively), we find that
the fraction of galaxies in an HDS phase has decreased from about 50% at z=1.2
to a few percent today. This decrease in fraction is due to an actual decrease
in the number density of massive HDS systems by a factor of 2-4, coupled with
an increase in the number density of massive galaxies by about 30 percent. We
show that this result depends only weakly on the threshold chosen for the
Hdelta equivalent width to define HDS systems (if greater than 4 A) and
corresponds to a (1+z)^{2.5\pm 0.7} evolution. Spectral synthesis studies of
the high-redshift population using the PEGASE code, treating Hdelta_A, EW[OII],
Dn4000, and rest-frame colors, favor models in which the Balmer absorption
features in massive Hdelta-strong systems are the echoes of intense episodes of
star-formation that faded about 1 Gyr prior to the epoch of observation. The
z=1.4-2 epoch appears to correspond to a time at which massive galaxies are in
transition from a mode of sustained star formation to a relatively quiescent
mode with weak and rare star-formation episodes. We argue that the most likely
local descendants of the distant massive HDS galaxies are passively evolving
massive galaxies in the field and small groups.",2005-03-17T22:06:42Z
"Stars in the USNO-B1 Catalog with Proper Motions Between 1.0 and 5.0
  arcseconds per year","This paper examines a subset of objects from the USNO-B1 catalogue with
listed proper motions between 1.0 and 5.0 arcseconds per year. We look at the
degree of contamination within this range of proper motions, and point out the
major sources of spurious high proper motion objects. Roughly 0.1% of the
objects in the USNO-B1 catalogue with listed motions between 1.0 and 5.0
arcseconds per year are real. Comparison with the revised version of Luyten's
Half Second catalogue indicates that USNO-B1 is only about 47% complete for
stars in this range. Preliminary studies indicate that there may be a dip in
completeness in USNO-B1 for objects with motions near 0.1 arcseconds per year.
We also present two new stars with motions between 1.0 and 5.0 arcseconds per
year, 36 new stars with confirmed motions between 0.1 and 1.0 arcseconds per
year, several new common proper motion pairs, and the recovery of LHS237a

"A Gravitational Mechanism for the Acceleration of Ultrarelativistic
  Particles","Imagine a swarm of free particles near a point P outside a gravitating mass M
and a free reference particle at P that is on a radial escape trajectory away
from M. Relative to this reference particle and in a Fermi normal coordinate
system constructed along its worldline, the particles in the swarm that move
along the radial direction and are ultrarelativistic (that is, they have speeds
above c/sqrt(2)) decelerate toward this terminal speed. On the other hand, the
swarm particles that are ultrarelativistic and move in directions normal to the
radial (jet) directions accelerate to almost the speed of light by the
gravitational tidal force of the mass M. The implications of these effects as
well as the influence of the higher-order terms on the tidal acceleration
mechanism are investigated. The observational evidence in support of these
general relativistic effects is briefly discussed.",2005-02-27T02:31:00Z
Narrow Band Chandra X-ray Analysis of Supernova Remnant 3C391,"We present the narrow-band and the equivalent width (EW) images of the
thermal composite supernova remnant (SNR) 3C391 for the X-ray emission lines of
elements Mg, Si, & S using the Chandra ACIS Observational data. These EW images
reveal the spatial distribution of the emission of the metal species Mg, Si, &
S in the remnant. They have clumpy structure similar to that seen from the
broadband diffuse emission, suggesting that they are largely of interstellar
origin. We find an interesting finger-like feature protruding outside the
southwestern radio border of the remnant, which is somewhat similar to the
jet-like Si structure found in the famous SNR Cas A. This feature may possibly
be the debris of the jet of ejecta which implies an asymmetrical supernova
explosion of a massive progenitor star.",2005-05-02T16:05:19Z
"The Hubble Deep Field North SCUBA Super-map III - Optical and
  near-infrared properties of submillimetre galaxies","We present a new sub-mm Super-map in the HDF-North region (GOODS-North
field), containing 40 statistically robust sources at 850 microns. This map
contains additional data, and several new sources, including one of the
brightest blank-sky extragalactic sub-mm sources ever detected. We have used
the ACS HST images and ground-based near-IR observations from GOODS to develop
a systematic approach for counterpart identification. 72 per cent of our
sources with optical coverage have a unique optical counterpart using our new
techniques for counterpart identification, and an additional 18 per cent have
more than one possibility that meet our criteria in the ACS images. We have
found a much higher ERO rate than other sub-mm surveys, due to the increased
depth in the optical images. The median photometric redshift (and quartile
range), from optical and near-infrared data, is 1.7 (1.3-2.5) for the
radio-detected sub-mm sources, and rises to 2.3 (1.3-2.7) for the
radio-undetected sub-sample. We find interesting correlations between the 850
micron flux and both the i magnitude and the photometric redshift, from which
there appears to be an absence of high redshift faint counterparts to the lower
flux density SCUBA sources. While the quantitative morphologies span a range of
values, in general the sub-mm galaxies show larger sizes and a higher degree of
asymmetry than other galaxy populations at the same redshifts.",2005-02-24T21:06:00Z
"Homogeneous Photometry IV: On the Standard Sequence in the Globular
  Cluster NGC2419","A new analysis of CCD-based BVRI broad-band photometry for the globular
cluster NGC2419 is presented, based on 340 CCD images either donated by
colleagues or retrieved from public archives. The calibrated results have been
made available through my Web site. I compare the results of my analysis with
those of an independent analysis of a subset of these data by Saha et al.
(2005, PASP, 117, 37), who have found a color-dependent discrepancy of up to
0.05 mag between their I-band photometry and mine for stars in this cluster. I
conclude that a major part of the discrepancy appears to be associated with
small (a few hundredths of a second) shutter-timing errors in the MiniMos
camera on the WIYN 3.5-m telescope. Smaller contributions to the anomaly likely
come from (a) a color-scale error with a maximum amplitude of ~ +/-0.02 mag in
my secondary standard list as of September 2004; and (b) statistical effects
arising from the previous study's use of a relatively small number of
standard-star observations to determine a comparatively large number of fitting
parameters in the photometric transformations.",2005-03-17T16:31:51Z
"Comments on the structure and dynamics of magnetic fields in stellar
  convection zones","This paper is a ``Habilitationsschrift'', a second thesis required until
recently by universities in Germany and in a few other countries to obtain the
right to lecture. It was accepted by the University of Goettingen in 1990 after
review by a number of german and international experts. Although the
introduction and the references represent the state of research in 1990, most
of the remaining content is still relevant and has never been published
elsewhere. The most important part is the derivation of a linear stability
formalism for thin magnetic flux tubes following an arbitrary path in a
gravitationally stratified medium with a stationary velocity. It was found
later (Ferriz-Mas & Schuessler, Geophys. Astrophys. Fluid Dyn. vol. 72, 209;
1995) that, for consistency, the inertial term in the equation of motion for
the external medium should be included in Eq. (3.24), which leads to an
additional term in the stability equations in the case of a spatially varying
external velocity. This term is missing in the present text, but can be easily
introduced into the formalism. The full abstract can be found at the beginning
of the paper.",2005-06-02T08:46:39Z
"High Resolution Spectroscopy of X-ray Quasars: Searching for the X-ray
  Absorption from the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium","We present a survey of six low to moderate redshift quasars with Chandra and
XMM-Newton. The primary goal is to search for the narrow X-ray absorption lines
produced by highly ionized metals in the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium. All the
X-ray spectra can be fitted by a power law with neutral hydrogen absorption
method. The residuals that may caused by additional emission mechanisms or
calibration uncertainties are taken account by polynomial in order to search
for narrow absorption features. No real absorption line is detected at above
3-sigma level in all the spectra. We discuss the implications of the lack of
absorption lines for our understanding of the baryon content of the universe
and metallicity of the intergalactic medium (IGM). We find that the
non-detection of X-ray absorption lines indicates that the metal abundance of
the IGM should be smaller than ~0.3 solar abundance. We also discuss
implications of the non-detection of any local (z ~ 0) X-ray absorption
associated with the ISM, Galactic halo or local group, such as has been seen
along several other lines of sight (LOS). By comparing a pair of LOSs we
estimate a lower limit on the hydrogen number density for the (z ~ 0) 3C 273
absorber of n_H >= 4e-3 cm^-3.",2005-06-06T22:53:25Z
"Constraints on radiatively inefficient accretion history from Eddington
  ratio distribution of active galactic nuclei","The transition of a standard thin disk to a radiatively inefficient accretion
flow (RIAF) is expected to occur, when the accretion rate is close to the
critical rate. The radiative efficiencies of accretion flows accreting at rates
lower than the critical accretion rate become significantly lower than that of
standard thin disks. It is believed that the initial transition radius is small
just after the accretion mode transition, and then the transition radius
increases with decreasing accretion rate, as suggested by some theoretical
models and observations. Based on such variable transition radius models, we
derive how the dimensionless accretion rate evolves with time from the observed
Eddington ratio distribution for a sample of low-luminosity active galactic
nuclei in the local universe. The derived time-dependent accretion rates show a
rapid decrease after the transition of the standard thin accretion disk to a
RIAF, which is consistent with that derived from the hard X-ray background.",2005-04-29T13:36:21Z
The persistence of the universal halo profiles,"Simple simulations suggest that the phase space structure of haloes
identified in cosmological calculations is invariant under the dynamics induced
by sinking substructure satellites -- the background expands so as to leave the
total distribution unchanged. We use a Fokker-Planck formulation to show that
this is the case. The solutions obtained are valid for any mass spectrum of
substructure, because the governing equation is linear in their mass weighed
phase space distribution. If the clumps are considered solid, an exchange of
poulations takes the form of an exponential instability, with characteristic
timescale of the order of the dynamical friction time, leading to a low energy
cutoff in the distribution function of the background and a constant density
core. We show that there are long lived solutions with such a cutoff. They
approximate a situation whereas the clumps are made of dense baryonic material.
When stripping is important, as in the case of dissipationless substructure, it
is likely that this situation is reversed -- the cutoff is now in the clump
distribution function. A simple description suggests that this renders
equilibria even more long lived. The results of this paper suggest that halo
profiles similar to those found in dissipationless cosmological simulations are
approximately invariant under the interaction induced by the presence of
substructure satellites -- a necessary condition for the observed
`universality'. In addition, the total profile, including baryons, should also
be invariant; provided the latter are initially in the form of dense clumps,
whose distribution follows that of the dark matter.",2005-02-23T01:40:56Z
The MAGIC Experiment and Its First Results,"With its diameter of 17m, the MAGIC telescope is the largest Cherenkov

Fractal Approach to Large-Scale Galaxy Distribution,"We present a review of the history and the present state of the fractal
approach to the large-scale distribution of galaxies. Angular correlation
function was used as a general instrument for the structure analysis. It was
realized later that a normalization condition for the reduced correlation
function estimator results in distorted values for both R_{hom} and fractal
dimension D. Moreover, according to a theorem on projections of fractals,
galaxy angular catalogues can not be used for detecting a structure with the
fractal dimension D>2. For this 3-d maps are required, and indeed modern
extensive redshift-based 3-d maps have revealed the ``hidden'' fractal
dimension of about 2, and have confirmed superclustering at scales even up to
500 Mpc (e.g. the Sloan Great Wall). On scales, where the fractal analysis is
possible in completely embedded spheres, a power--law density field has been
found. The fractal dimension D =2.2 +- 0.2 was directly obtained from 3-d maps
and R_{hom} has expanded from 10 Mpc to scales approaching 100 Mpc. In
concordance with the 3-d map results, modern all sky galaxy counts in the
interval 10^m - 15^m give a 0.44m-law which corresponds to D=2.2 within a
radius of 100h^{-1}_{100} Mpc. We emphasize that the fractal mass--radius law
of galaxy clustering has become a key phenomenon in observational cosmology.",2005-05-10T12:00:51Z
The Effects of Clumping on Derived Abundances in H II Regions,"We have compared Monte Carlo photoionization models of H II regions with a
uniform density distribution with models with the same central stars and
chemical compositions but with 3-D hierarchical clumps. We compare the
abundances of He, N, O, Ne, and S obtained from emission line strengths and [O
III] and [N II] temperatures to those in our models. We consider stellar
temperatures in the range 37.5 -- 45kK and ionizing luminosities from 10^{48}
to 10^{51} photons/s.
  Clumped models have different ionic abundances than uniform. For hot stars,
He^0/He^+ is 2 -- 3%, much larger than with uniform models. This amount of He I
is independent of metallicity and so impacts the determination of the
primordial abundance of He. The total abundances of O, Ne, and S obtained by
the usual methods of analysis, using T([OIII) for high stages of ionization and
T([NII]) for low, are about as accurate for clumped models as for uniform and
within about 20% of the true values. If T([OIII]) is used for analyzing all
ions, the derived (O/H) is 40 to 60% too large for cool stars but is good for
hot stars. Uniform models have similar errors, so the clumping does not change
the accuracy of abundance analysis.
  The physical causes of the ionic abundance errors are present in real
nebulae. In clumped models, helium ionizing radiation from zones of high
ionization (low He^0 and low UV opacity) can penetrate nearby regions near the
edge of the ionized zone. This effect allows He^0 to absorb more stellar
photons than in uniform or radially symmetrical geometries. In turn, these
absorptions compete with O+, etc., for those energetic stellar photons.",2005-03-26T16:52:30Z
The peak luminosity - peak energy correlation in GRBs,"We derive the peak luminosity - peak energy (L_iso - E_peak) correlation
using 22 long Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) with firm redshift measurements. We find
that its slope is similar to the correlation between the time integrated
isotropic emitted energy E_iso and E_peak (Amati et al. 2002). For the 15 GRBs
in our sample with estimated jet opening angle we compute the collimation
corrected peak luminosity L_gamma, and find that it correlates with E_peak.
This has, however, a scatter larger than the correlation between E_peak and
E_gamma (the time integrated emitted energy, corrected for collimation;
Ghirlanda et al. 2004), which we ascribe to the fact that the opening angle is
estimated through the global energetics. We have then selected a large sample
of 442 GRBs with pseudo--redshifts, derived through the lag-luminosity
relation, to test the existence of the L_iso-E_peak correlation. With this
sample we also explore the possibility of a correlation between time resolved
quantities, namely L_iso,p and the peak energy at the peak of emission
E_peak,p.",2005-02-23T18:56:24Z
"RASS-SDSS Galaxy Cluster Survey. IV. A ubiquitous dwarf galaxy
  population in clusters","We analyze the Luminosity Functions (LFs) of a subsample of 69 clusters from
the RASS-SDSS galaxy cluster catalog. When calculated within the cluster
physical sizes, given by r200 or r500, all the cluster LFs appear to have the
same shape, well fitted by a composite of two Schechter functions with a marked
upturn and a steepening at the faint-end. Previously reported
cluster-to-cluster variations of the LF faint-end slope are due to the use of a
metric cluster aperture for computing the LF of clusters of different masses.
  We determine the composite LF for early- and late-type galaxies, where the
typing is based on the galaxy u-r colors. The late-type LF is well fitted by a
single Schechter function with a steep slope (alpha=-2.0 in the r band, within
r200}). The early-type LF instead cannot be fitted by a single Schechter
function, and a composite of two Schechter functions is needed. The faint-end
upturn of the global cluster LF is due to the early-type cluster galaxies. The
shape of the bright-end tail of the early-type LF does not seem to depend upon
the local galaxy density or the distance from the cluster center. The late-type
LF shows a significant variation only very near the cluster center. On the
other hand, the faint-end tail of the early-type LF shows a significant and
continuous variation with the environment. We provide evidence that the process
responsible for creating the excess population of dwarf early type galaxies in
clusters is a threshold process that occurs when the density exceeds ~500 times
the critical density of the Universe. We interpret our results in the context
of the 'harassment' scenario, where faint early-type cluster galaxies are
predicted to be the descendants of tidally-stripped late-type galaxies.",2005-06-09T13:32:10Z
Flux Modulation from Non-Axisymmetric Stuctures in Accretion Discs,"Non-axisymmetric accretion discs can lead to flux variability. Here we
provide an analytic framework for modeling non-axisymmetric structures like
hotspots and spiral waves and their influence on observed timing measurements.
The presently unexplained Low-frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (LFQPO),
observed in X-ray binaries and cataclysmic variables, could be the result of
such discs. Our framework serves as a guide to quantify the properties that
non-axisymmetric structures produced by nonlinear accretion disc models must
have in order to explain observed features such as LFQPOs. The results from our
microquasar appliations also provide analogous predictions for X-ray modulation
in active galactic nuclei. The formalism and physical interpration is of
practical use for generic non-axisymmetric accretion disc systems.",2005-06-06T18:44:54Z
"Dichroic Masers due to Radiation Anisotropy and the Influence of the
  Hanle Effect on the Circumstellar SiO Polarization","The theory of the generation and transfer of polarized radiation, mainly
developed for interpreting solar spectropolarimetric observations, allows to
reconsider, in a more rigorous and elegant way, a physical mechanism that has
been suggested some years ago to interpret the high degree of polarization
often observed in astronomical masers. This mechanism, for which the name of
'dichroic maser' is proposed, can operate when a low density molecular cloud is
illuminated by an anisotropic source of radiation (like for instance a nearby
star). Here we investigate completely unsaturated masers and show that
selective stimulated emission processes are capable of producing highly
polarized maser radiation in a non-magnetic environment. The polarization of
the maser radiation is linear and is directed tangentially to a ring
equidistant to the central star. We show that the Hanle effect due to the
presence of a magnetic field can produce a rotation (from the tangential
direction) of the polarization by more that 45 degrees for some selected
combinations of the strength, inclination and azimuth of the magnetic field
vector. However, these very same conditions produce a drastic inhibition of the
maser effect. The rotations of about 90 degrees observed in SiO masers in the
evolved stars TX Cam by Kemball & Diamond (1997) and IRC+10011 by Desmurs et al
(2000) may then be explainedby a local modification of the anisotropy of the
radiation field, being transformed from mainly radial to mainly tangential.",2005-02-21T11:05:58Z
Neutrino statistics and big bang nucleosynthesis,"Neutrinos may possibly violate the spin-statistics theorem, and hence obey
Bose statistics or mixed statistics despite having spin half. We find the
generalized equilibrium distribution function of neutrinos which depends on a
single fermi-bose parameter, \kappa, and interpolates continuously between the
bosonic and fermionic distributions when \kappa changes from -1 to +1. We
consider modification of the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) in the presence of
bosonic or partly bosonic neutrinos. For pure bosonic neutrinos the abundances
change (in comparison with the usual Fermi-Dirac case) by -3.2% for 4He (which
is equivalent to a decrease of the effective number of neutrinos by \Delta
N_\nu = - 0.6), +2.6% for 2H and -7% for 7Li. These changes provide a better
fit to the BBN data. Future BBN studies will be able to constrain the
fermi-bose parameter to \kappa > 0.5, if no deviation from fermionic nature of
neutrinos is found. We also evaluate the sensitivity of future CMB and LSS
observations to the fermi-bose parameter.",2005-03-29T09:15:56Z
"The Spitzer c2d Survey of Large, Nearby, Interstellar Clouds. I.
  Chamaeleon II Observed with MIPS","We present maps of over 1.5 square degrees in Chamaeleon (Cha) II at 24, 70,
and 160 micron observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope Multiband Imaging
Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) and a 1.2 square degree millimeter map from SIMBA
on the Swedish-ESO Submillimetre Telescope (SEST). The c2d Spitzer Legacy
Team's data reduction pipeline is described in detail. Over 1500 24 micron
sources and 41 70 micron sources were detected by MIPS with fluxes greater than
10-sigma. More than 40 potential YSOs are identified with a MIPS and 2MASS
color-color diagram and by their spectral indices, including two previously
unknown sources with 24 micron excesses. Our new SIMBA millimeter map of Cha II
shows that only a small fraction of the gas is in compact structures with high
column densities. The extended emission seen by MIPS is compared with previous
CO observations. Some selected interesting sources, including two detected at 1

"RXJ0142.0+2131: I. The galaxy content of an X-ray-luminous galaxy
  cluster at z=0.28","We present a photometric and spectroscopic study of stellar populations in
the X-ray-luminous cluster of galaxies RXJ0142.0+2131 at z=0.280. This paper
analyses the results of high signal-to-noise spectroscopy, as well as g'-, r'-,
and i'-band imaging, using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph on Gemini
North. Of 43 spectroscopic targets, we find 30 cluster members over a range in
color. Central velocity dispersions and absorption-line strengths for lines in
the range 3700A < lambda_rest < 5800A are derived for cluster members, and are
compared with a low-redshift sample of cluster galaxies, and single stellar
population (SSP) models. We use a combination of these indicators to estimate
luminosity-weighted mean ages, metallicities ([M/H]), and alpha-element
abundance ratios ([alpha/Fe]).
  RXJ0142.0+2131 is a relatively poor cluster and lacks galaxies with high
central velocity dispersions. Although the red sequence and the Faber-Jackson
relation are consistent with pure passive evolution of the early-type
population with a formation redshift of z_form = 2, the strengths of the 4000A
break and scaling relations between metal line indices and velocity dispersion
reject this model with high significance. By inverting SSP models for the
Hbeta_G, Mgb, and <Fe> line indices, we calculate that, at a given velocity
dispersion and metallicity, galaxies in RXJ0142.0+2131 have luminosity-weighted
mean ages 0.14 +- 0.07 dex older than the low-redshift sample. We also find
that [alpha/Fe] in stellar populations in RXJ0142.0+2131 is 0.14 +- 0.03
greater than at low redshift. All scaling relations are consistent with these
estimated offsets. (abridged)",2005-04-04T15:10:59Z
"From young massive star cluster to old globular: the L_V-sigma_0
  relationship as a diagnostic tool","We present a new analysis of the properties of the young massive star
clusters, which demonstrates that these objects are plausible progenitors of
old globular clusters (GCs). The method is based on the tight relationship for
old GCs between their V-band luminosities and (central) velocity dispersions,
sigma_0. We improve the significance of the relationship and find that its
functional form, L_V/Lsun \propto sigma_0^(1.57 +- 0.10) (km/s), is fully
consistent with previous determinations for smaller Galactic and M31 GC
samples. The tightness of the relationship for a GC sample drawn from
environments as diverse as those found in the Local Group implies that its
origin must be sought in intrinsic properties of the GC formation process
itself. We evolve the luminosities of the young massive star clusters (YMCs) in
the local Universe to an age of 12 Gyr and find that most YMCs will evolve to
loci close to, or to slightly fainter luminosities than the improved GC
relationship. In the absence of significant external disturbances, this implies
that these objects may potentially survive to become old GC-type objects over a
Hubble time. The main advantage of our new method is its simplicity; the only
observables required here are the system's velocity dispersion and luminosity.
The most important factor affecting the robustness of our conclusions is the
adopted form of the initial mass function. We use N-body simulations to confirm
that dynamical evolution of the clusters does not significantly alter our
conclusions. [ABRIDGED]",2005-04-22T10:57:22Z
Observing Near Earth Asteroids with a Small Telescope,"Even from a light polluted city it is possible to observe Near Earth
Asteroids (NEAs) at opposition using a small telescope equipped with a CCD
camera. In this paper, we will overview first the major NEA programs,
continuing with planning the observations and the data reduction. Second, we
will present a NEA follow-up program carried out on the 60-cm telescope at York
University Observatory in Toronto, Canada. Part of this program, five NEAs have
been observed during ten nights. Their astrometric and photometric data were
reduced and sent to the Minor Planet Centre, following which an observatory
code was assigned and four batches have been included in the NEODyS database
and MPC Circulars. The results are applicable to any other small facility.",2005-04-11T02:56:29Z
The Lens Galaxy In PG1115+080 is an Ellipse,"We use the structure of the Einstein ring image of the quasar host galaxy in
the four-image quasar lens PG1115+080 to determine the angular structure of the
gravitational potential of the lens galaxy. We find that it is well described
as an ellipsoid and that the best fit non-ellipsoidal models are consistent
with the ellipsoidal model. We find upper limits on the standard parameters for
the m=3 and m=4 deviations from an ellipse of <0.035 and <0.064, respectively.
We also find that the position of the center of mass is consistent with the
center of light, with an upper limit of 0.005 arcsec on the offset between
them. Neither the ellipsoidal nor the non-ellipsoidal models can reproduce the
observed image flux ratios while simultaneously maintaining a reasonable fit to
the Einstein ring, so the anomalous flux ratio of the A_1 and A_2 quasar images
must be due to substructure in the gravitational potential such as compact
satellite galaxies or stellar microlenses rather than odd angular structure in
the lens galaxy.",2005-02-15T21:00:22Z
Interpreting microlensing signal in QSO 2237+0305: Stars or planets?,"The multiply imaged, gravitationally lensed quasar, QSO 2237+0305, has been
the subject of recent optical monitoring campaigns, with its light curves
displaying uncorrelated variability attributed to gravitational microlensing by
masses in the foreground galaxy. Based on these light curves, it has been
claimed that the dominant microlensing population must be a population of
free-floating Jupiter-like objects; such a conclusion is not new, with several
similar claims in the literature. Historically, however, it has been shown that
such conclusions are flawed, with an incorrect interpretation of the complex
caustic network that arises at significant optical depth. This paper examines
this more recent claim, illustrating that it too is flawed.",2005-05-18T11:32:34Z
"The Proper Motion of the Magellanic Clouds: The UCAC2-Hipparcos
  Inconsistency","Using the USNO CCD Astrograph all-sky Catalog (UCAC2), we measure the mean
proper motion of the two Magellanic Clouds. Appropriately selected LMC
populations show a proper motion (<\mu RA>, <\mu DEC>) ~ (+0.84,+4.32) that is
significantly higher, in <\mu DEC>, than currently accepted Hipparcos-like
values, <\mu RA>, <\mu DEC> ~ (+1.94,-0.14). A higher <\mu RA> value is also
found for the SMC. Interestingly, the mean UCAC2 LMC proper motion agrees very
well with the only work in the literature (Anguita et al. 2000) pointing to an
unbound Magellanic Clouds-Milky Way interaction. Nonetheless, the implications
of the UCAC2 proper motion are hard to reconcile with our present day
understanding of the Clouds-Galaxy interaction unless one assumes a more
massive Milky Way. Consequently, although no sources of systematic error have
been identified, it is perhaps most likely that the UCAC2 catalog has an as yet
unidentified systematic error resulting in an inconsistency between UCAC2 and
Hipparcos based results for the Magellanic Clouds.",2005-04-18T20:03:17Z
"Measuring the Galaxy-Galaxy-Mass Three-point Correlation Function with
  Weak Gravitational Lensing","We discuss the galaxy-galaxy-mass three-point correlation function and show
how to measure it with weak gravitational lensing. The method entails choosing
a large of pairs of foreground lens galaxies and constructing a mean shear map
with respect to their axis, by averaging the ellipticities of background source
galaxies. An average mass map can be reconstructed from this shear map and this
will represent the average mass distribution around pairs of galaxies. We show
how this mass map is related to the projected galaxy-galaxy-mass three-point
correlation function. Using a large N-body dark matter simulation populated
with galaxies using the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) bias prescription,
we compute these correlation functions, mass maps, and shear maps. The
resultant mass maps are distinctly bimodal, tracing the galaxy centers and
remaining anisotropic up to scales much larger than the galaxy separation. At
larger scales, the shear is approximately tangential about the center of the
pair but with small azimuthal variation in amplitude. We estimate the
signal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed mass maps for a survey of similar
depth to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and conclude that the
galaxy-galaxy-mass three-point function should be measurable with the current
SDSS weak lensing data. Measurements of this three-point function, along with
galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy auto-correlation functions, will provide new
constraints on galaxy bias models. The anisotropic shear profile around close
pairs of galaxies is a prediction of cold dark matter models and may be
difficult to reconcile with alternative theories of gravity without dark
matter.",2005-03-13T05:06:14Z
Quasi-Periodic Oscillations in Relativistic Tori,"Motivated by recent interesting work on p-mode oscillations in axisymmetric
hydrodynamic black-hole tori by Rezzolla, Zanotti, and collaborators, I explore
the robustness of these oscillations by means of two and three-dimensional
relativistic hydrodynamic and MHD simulations. The primary purpose of this
investigation is to determine how the amplitudes of these oscillations are
affected by the presence of known instabilities of black-hole tori, including
the Papaloizou-Pringle instability (PPI) and the magneto-rotational instability
(MRI). Both instabilities drive accretion at rates above those considered in
Rezzolla's work. The increased accretion can allow wave energy to leak out of
the torus into the hole. Furthermore, with the MRI, the presence of turbulence,
which is absent in the hydrodynamic simulations, can lead to turbulent damping
(or excitation) of modes. The current numerical results are preliminary, but
suggest that the PPI and MRI both significantly damp acoustic oscillations in
tori.",2005-03-14T21:55:45Z
Constraining Cosmological Parameters by the Cosmic Inversion Method,"We investigate the question of how tightly we can constrain the cosmological
parameters by using the ``cosmic inversion'' method in which we directly
reconstruct the power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations, $P(k)$,
from the temperature and polarization spectra of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB). In a previous paper, we suggested that it may be possible to
constrain the cosmological parameters using the fact that the reconstructed
$P(k)$ does not depend on how many polarization data we incorporate in our
inversion procedure if and only if the correct values of the cosmological
parameters are used. The advantage of this approach is that we need no
assumption regarding the functional form of $P(k)$. In this paper, we estimate
typical errors in the determination of the cosmological parameters when our
method is applied to the PLANCK observation. We investigate constraints on $h$,
$\Omega_b$, $\Omega_m$, and $\Omega_\Lambda$ through Monte Carlo simulations.",2005-04-21T14:22:43Z
The fractal distribution of haloes,"We examine the proposal that a model of the large-scale matter distribution
consisting of randomly placed haloes with power-law profile, as opposed to a
fractal model, can account for the observed power-law galaxy-galaxy
correlations. We conclude that such model, which can actually be considered as
a degenerate multifractal model, is not realistic but suggests a new picture of
multifractal models, namely, as sets of fractal distributions of haloes. We
analyse, according to this picture, the properties of the matter distribution
produced in cosmological N-body simulations, with affirmative results; namely,
haloes of similar mass have a fractal distribution with a given dimension,
which grows as the mass diminishes.",2005-05-30T17:47:09Z
Radial velocity moments of dark matter haloes,"Using cosmological N-body simulations we study the radial velocity
distribution in dark matter haloes focusing on the lowest-order even moments,
dispersion and kurtosis. We determine the properties of ten massive haloes in
the simulation box approximating their density distribution by the NFW formula
characterized by the virial mass and concentration. We also calculate the
velocity anisotropy parameter of the haloes and find it mildly radial and
increasing with distance from the halo centre. The radial velocity dispersion
of the haloes shows a characteristic profile with a maximum, while the radial
kurtosis profile decreases with distance starting from a value close to
Gaussian near the centre. We therefore confirm that dark matter haloes possess
intrinsically non-Gaussian, flat-topped velocity distributions. We find that
the radial velocity moments of the simulated haloes are quite well reproduced
by the solutions of the Jeans equations obtained for the halo parameters with
the anisotropy measured in the simulations. We also study the radial velocity
moments for a composite cluster made of ten haloes out to ten virial radii. In
this region the velocity dispersion decreases systematically to reach the value
of the background, while kurtosis increases from below to above the Gaussian
value of 3 signifying a transition from a flat-topped to a strongly peaked
velocity distribution with respect to the Gaussian, which can be interpreted as
the dominance of ordered flow with a small dispersion. We illustrate the
transition by showing explicitly the velocity distribution of the composite
cluster in a few radial bins.",2005-03-17T14:43:15Z
"Extracting energy from black holes: ""long"" and ""short"" GRBs and their
  astrophysical settings","The introduction of the three interpretational paradigms for Gamma-Ray Bursts
(GRBs) and recent progress in understanding the X- and gamma ray luminosity in
the afterglow allow us to make assessments about the astrophysical settings of
GRBs. In particular, we evidence the distinct possibility that some GRBs occur
in a binary system. This subclass of GRBs manifests itself in a ""tryptich"": one
component formed by the collapse of a massive star to a black hole, which
originates the GRB; a second component by a supernova and a third one by a
young neutron star born in the supernova event. Similarly, the understanding of
the physics of quantum relativistic processes during the gravitational collapse
makes possible precise predictions about the structure of short GRBs.",2005-05-09T10:26:21Z
Optical Sources Near the Bright X-Ray Source in NGC 1073,"New HST observations show that the bright X-ray source in the face-on spiral
galaxy NGC 1073 is located near a ring of recent star formation with an age of
8-16 Myr. This strengthens the association of X-ray sources in spiral galaxies
emitting near or above the Eddington limit for a 20 solar mass black hole with
recent star formation events. Two candidate optical counterparts of the X-ray
source are found. The X-ray to optical flux ratios of both are consistent with
those of low-mass X-ray binaries and higher than most high-mass X-ray binaries,
suggesting that reprocessing of X-rays contributes to the optical light. The
optical magnitude and color of one candidate is consistent with that predicted
for an X-ray binary with an initial donor mass of 6-8 solar masses. However,
the same X-ray binary evolution model underestimates the X-ray luminosity. An
X-ray source list for the field is presented which includes detections of the
nucleus of NGC 1073, three quasars, and an M3e brown dwarf star with high
proper motion.",2005-05-02T16:12:14Z
"Pulsation and evolutionary masses of classical Cepheids. I. Milky Way
  variables","We investigate a selected sample of Galactic classical Cepheids with
available distance and reddening estimates in the framework of the theoretical
scenario provided by pulsation models, computed with metal abundance Z=0.02,
helium content in the range of Y=0.25 to 0.31, and various choices of the
stellar mass and luminosity. After transforming the bolometric light curve of
the fundamental models into BVRIJK magnitudes, we derived analytical relations
connecting the pulsation period with the stellar mass, the mean
(intensity-averaged) absolute magnitude, and the color of the pulsators. These
relations are used together with the Cepheid observed absolute magnitudes in
order to determine the ""pulsation"" mass -M_p- of each individual variable. The
comparison with the ""evolutionary"" masses -M_(e,can)- given by canonical (no
convective core overshooting, no mass-loss) models of central He-burning
stellar structures reveals that the M_p/M_(e,can) ratio is correlated with the
Cepheid period, ranging from about 0.8 at logP=0.5 to about 1 at logP=1.5. We
discuss the effects of different input physics and/or assumptions on the
evolutionary computations, as well as of uncertainties in the adopted Cepheid
metal content, distance, and reddening. Eventually, we find that the
pulsational results can be interpreted in terms of mass-loss during or before
the Cepheid phase, whose amount increases as the Cepheid original mass
decreases. It vanishes around 13M_(sun) and increases up to about 20% at
4M_(sun).",2005-05-08T10:11:58Z
Rotation of the cluster of galaxies A2107,"We present indications of rotation in the galaxy cluster A2107 by a method
that searches for the maximum gradient in the velocity field in a flat
disk-like model of a cluster. Galaxies from cumulative sub-samples containing
more and more distant members from the cluster centre, are projected onto an
axis passing through the centre and we apply a linear regression model on the
projected distances $x$ and the line-of-sight velocities $V$. The axis with the
maximum linear correlation coefficient $r_{max} = \max [ r(V,x) ]$ defines the
direction of the maximum velocity gradient, and consequently it presents the
major axis of the apparently elliptical cluster. Because the effects of
rotation are subtle, we put strong emphasis on the estimation of the
uncertainties of the results by implementing different bootstrap techniques. We
have found the rotational effects are more strongly expressed from distances
$0.26 \div 0.54$ Mpc from the cluster centre. The total virial mass of the
cluster is $(3.2\pm0.6)\times10^{14} {\cal M}_{\sun}$, while the virial mass,
corrected for the rotation, is $(2.8\pm0.5) \times 10^{14}{\cal M}_{\sun}$.",2005-05-05T08:57:05Z
Cosmological Structures behind the Milky Way,"This paper provides an update to the review on extragalactic large-scale
structures uncovered in the Zone of Avoidance (ZOA) by Kraan-Korteweg & Lahav
2000, in particular in the Great Attractor region. Emphasis is given to the
penetration of the ZOA with the in 2003 released NIR 2MASX Catalog. The
distribution is little affected by the foreground dust. Galaxies can be
identified to extinction levels of over A(B) < 10m except in the wider Galactic
Bulge region (see Fig. 9) where star density is a strong delimiting factor. The
shape of the NIR-ZOA is quite asymmetric due to Galactic features such as
spiral arms and the Bulge, something that should not be ignored when using NIR
samples for studies such as dipole determinations.
  Results are presented from the deep blind HI ZOA survey performed with the
Multibeam Receiver at the Parkes telescope (v < 12700km/s). The distribution of
the roughly one thousand discovered spiral galaxies in the optically and NIR
impenetratable part of the ZOA clearly depict the prominence of the Norma
Supercluster. With the optically identified galaxies in the ZOA, a picture
emerges that bears a striking resemblance to the Coma cluster in the Great
Wall: the rich Norma cluster (ACO 3627) lies within a great-wall like structure
that can be traced at the redshift range of the cluster over 90dg on the sky,
with two foreground filaments - reminiscent of the legs in the famous stick man
- that merge in an overdensity at slightly lower redshifts around the radio
galaxy PKS 1343-601 (see Figs. 14 & 16). (abridged)",2005-02-10T15:33:17Z

Network at the 5 GHz frequency on 2003 November 4. The source is compact at the
milli-arcsecond (mas) angular scale with a flux density of 0.34 mJy. The
observations with the Very Large Array (VLA) made on the consecutive day

to ~2 mas.",2005-04-20T07:42:40Z
The HST Cosmos Project: Contribution from the Subaru Telescope,"The Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) is a Hubble Space Telescope (HST)

"Near-Infrared echelle spectroscopy of Proto-Planetary Nebulae: probing
  the fast wind in H2","Echelle spectroscopy of H2, [FeII] and Br-gamma line emission from a very
young planetary nebula, IRAS 21282+5050, and from four proto-planetary nebulae,
IRAS 19343+2926 (M 1-92), IRAS 17150-3224 (AFGL 6815), IRAS 17423-1755 (Hen
3-1475), and IRAS 17441-2411 is presented. H2 line emission is detected in
discrete shock fronts in the lobes of each nebula, regardless of source
spectral type. In IRAS 17150-3224 we also uncover possible signs of rotation,
as would be expected if the H2 features were excited in a magneto-centrifugal
disk wind. [FeII] emission was detected in only one source, M 1-92. The H2 and
[FeII] observations of M 1-92, and the complex H2 profiles in IRAS 21282+5050,
are explained using the shock models of Smith and collaborators. J-type bow
models are adequate in each case, i.e. a strongly-magnetised wind is not
required. Finally, Br-gamma is detected in each of the five targets; in
absorption in the G-type PPN though in emission in the O and B-type sources.
Br-gamma emission is detected predominantly toward the near-IR continuum peak
in each PPN. Low peak velocities, though very broad profile widths, are
measured in each target. The emission must therefore derive from ionised
regions in a fast wind very close to the central star, or, in the late-type
sources, from absorption in an equatorial torus.",2005-03-15T21:49:36Z
"Spiral galaxies with a central plateau in the gas velocity curve along
  the major axis","We present the minor-axis kinematics of ionized gas and stars for a sample of
5 spiral galaxies, which are characterized by either a zero or a shallow gas
velocity gradient along their major axis. The asymmetric velocity profiles
observed along the minor axis of NGC 4064 and NGC 4189 can be explained as due
to the presence of a bar. This is also the case of NGC 4178 where the innermost
portion of the gaseous disk is nearly face on. In NGC 4424 and NGC 4941, we
measured non-zero gas velocities only in the central regions along the minor
axis and gas velocities drop to zero at larger radii. This kinematic feature is
suggestive of the presence of an orthogonally-rotating gaseous component which
is confined in the innermost regions (i.e. an inner polar disk) to be confirmed
with integral-field spectroscopy.",2005-05-19T13:46:18Z
Energy composition of the Universe: time-independent internal symmetry,"The energy composition of the Universe, as emerged from the Type Ia supernova
observations and the WMAP data, looks preposterously complex, -- but only at
the first glance. In fact, its structure proves to be simple and regular. An
analysis in terms of the Friedmann integral enables to recognize a remarkably
simple time-independent covariant robust recipe of the cosmic mix: the
numerical values of the Friedmann integral for vacuum, dark matter, baryons and
radiation are approximately identical. The identity may be treated as a
symmetry relation that unifies cosmic energies into a regular set, a quartet,
with the Friedmann integral as its common genuine time-independent physical
parameter. Such cosmic internal (non-geometrical) symmetry exists whenever
cosmic energies themselves exist in nature. It is most natural for a finite
Universe suggested by the WMAP data. A link to fundamental theory may be found
under the assumption about a special significance of the electroweak energy
scale in both particle physics and cosmology. A freeze-out model developed on
this basis demonstrates that the physical nature of new symmetry might be due
to the interplay between electroweak physics and gravity at the cosmic age of a
few picoseconds. The big `hierarchy number' of particle physics represents the
interplay in the model. This number quantifies the Friedmann integral and gives
also a measure to some other basic cosmological figures and phenomena
associated with new symmetry. In this way, cosmic internal symmetry provides a
common ground for better understanding of old and recent problems that
otherwise seem unrelated; the coincidence of the observed cosmic densities, the
flatness of the co-moving space, the initial perturbations and their amplitude,
the cosmic entropy are among them.",2005-03-16T17:24:10Z
Giant flare of SGR 1806-20 from a relativistic jet,"Japanese magnetospheric explorer GEOTAIL recorded a detailed light curve
during the initial 600 msec of a giant flare from SGR 1806-20 on December 27,
2004. We show that the observed light curve is well explained by an emission
from relativistically expanding fireballs, like those of gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs). Especially, the observed rapid fading after 500msec suggests that
ejecta is collimated in a jet. We derive an upper limit on the jet opening
half-angle of 0.2 radian that is as narrow as those of GRBs.",2005-02-16T15:51:34Z
Comparison of White Dwarf Mass Determinations,"White dwarf masses can be determined in several ways. Here we compare masses

"Chemical Composition in the Globular Cluster M71 from Keck/HIRES Spectra
  of Turn-Off Stars","We have made observations with the Keck I telescope and HIRES at a resolution
of $\sim$45,000 of five nearly identical stars at the turn-off of the
metal-rich globular cluster M 71. Our mean Fe abundance, [Fe/H]=-0.80 +-0.02,
is in excellent agreement with previous cluster determinations from both giants
and near-turnoff stars. There is no clear evidence for any star-to-star
abundance differences or correlations in our sample. Abundance ratios of the
Fe-peak elements (Cr, Ni) are similar to Fe. The turn-off stars in M71 have
remarkably consistent enhancements of 0.2 - 0.3 dex in [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe] and
[Ti/Fe] -- like the red giants. Our [Mg/Fe] ratio is somewhat lower than that
suggested by other studies. We compare our mean abundances for the five M 71
stars with field stars of similar [Fe/H] -- 8 with halo kinematics and 17 with
disk kinematics. The abundances of the alpha-fusion products (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti)
agree with both samples, but seem a closer match to the disk stars. The Mg
abundance in M71 is at the lower edge of the disk and halo samples. The
neutron-capture elements, Y and Ba, are enhanced relative to solar in the M71
turn-off stars. Our ratio [Ba/Fe] is similar to that of the halo field stars
but a factor of two above that for the disk field stars. The important [Ba/Y]
ratio is significantly lower than M71 giant values. The Na content of the M71
turn-off stars is remarkably similar to that in the disk field stars, but more
than a factor of two higher than the halo field star sample. We find [Na/Fe] =
+0.14 $\pm$0.04 with a spread less than half of that found in the red giants in
M71. Excluding Mg, the lack of intracluster $\alpha$-element variations
(turn-off vs giants) suggests the polluting material arose in a more
traditional $s$-process environment such as AGB stars.",2005-05-06T22:09:51Z
"Extinction properties of the X-ray bright/optically faint afterglow of
  GRB 020405","We present an optical-to-X-ray spectral analysis of the afterglow of GRB
020405. The optical spectral energy distribution not corrected for the
extragalactic extinction is significantly below the X-ray extrapolation of the
single powerlaw spectral model suggested by multiwavelength studies. We
investigate whether considerable extinction could explain the observed spectral
``mismatch'' by testing several types of extinction curves. For the first time
we test extinction curves computed with time-dependent numerical simulations of
dust grains destruction by the burst radiation. We find that an extinction law
weakly depen dent on wavelength can reconcile the unabsorbed optical and X-ray
data with the expected synchrotron spectrum. A gray extinction law can be
provided by a dust grain size distribution biased toward large grains.",2005-06-17T13:34:40Z
"Finding Young Stellar Populations in Elliptical Galaxies from
  Independent Components of Optical Spectra","Elliptical galaxies are believed to consist of a single population of old
stars formed together at an early epoch in the Universe, yet recent analyses of
galaxy spectra seem to indicate the presence of significant younger populations
of stars in them. The detailed physical modelling of such populations is
computationally expensive, inhibiting the detailed analysis of the several
million galaxy spectra becoming available over the next few years. Here we
present a data mining application aimed at decomposing the spectra of
elliptical galaxies into several coeval stellar populations, without the use of
detailed physical models. This is achieved by performing a linear independent
basis transformation that essentially decouples the initial problem of joint
processing of a set of correlated spectral measurements into that of the
independent processing of a small set of prototypical spectra. Two methods are
investigated: (1) A fast projection approach is derived by exploiting the
correlation structure of neighboring wavelength bins within the spectral data.
(2) A factorisation method that takes advantage of the positivity of the
spectra is also investigated. The preliminary results show that typical
features observed in stellar population spectra of different evolutionary
histories can be convincingly disentangled by these methods, despite the
absence of input physics. The success of this basis transformation analysis in
recovering physically interpretable representations indicates that this

Prospects for Detection of Catastrophic Collisions in Debris Disks,"We investigate the prospects for detecting dust from two body collisions
during the late stages of planet formation at 1-150 AU. We develop an analytic
model to describe the formation of a dusty cloud of debris and use numerical
coagulation and n-body calculations to predict observable signals from these
events. In a minimum mass solar nebula, collisions of 100-1000 km objects at
distances of 3-5 AU or less from the parent star are observable at mid-infrared
wavelengths as bright clumps or rings of dust. At 24 microns, the clumps are
roughly 0.1-1 mag brighter than emission from dust in the background debris
disk. In edge-on systems, dusty clumps produce eclipses with depths of 1.0 mag
or less that last for roughly 100 orbital periods. Large-scale surveys for
transits from exosolar planets, such as Kepler, can plausibly detect these
eclipses and provide important constraints on the terrestrial environment for
ages of less than or roughly 100-300 Myr.",2005-03-24T18:10:54Z
Interactions of Jets with Inhomogeneous Cloudy Media,"We present two-dimensional slab-jet simulations of jets in inhomogeneous
media consisting of a tenuous hot medium populated with a small filling factor
by warm, dense clouds. The simulations are relevant to the structure and
dynamics of sources such as Gigahertz Peak Spectrum and Compact Steep Spectrum
radio galaxies, High Redshift Radio Galaxies and radio galaxies in cooling
flows. The jets are disrupted to a degree depending upon the filling factor of
the clouds. With a small filling factor, the jet retains some forward momentum
but also forms a halo or bubble around the source. At larger filling factors
channels are formed in the cloud distribution through which the jet plasma
flows and a hierarchical structure consisting of nested lobes and an outer
enclosing bubble results. We suggest that the CSS quasar 3C48 is an example of
a low filling factor jet - interstellar medium interaction whilst M87 may be an
example of the higher filling factor type of interaction. Jet disruption occurs
primarily as a result of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities driven by turbulence in
the radio cocoon not through direct jet-cloud interactions, although there are
some examples of these. In all radio galaxies whose morphology may be the
result of jet interactions with an inhomogeneous interstellar medium we expect
that the dense clouds will be optically observable as a result of radiative
shocks driven by the pressure of the radio cocoon. We also expect that the
radio galaxies will possess faint haloes of radio emitting material well beyond
the observable jet structure.",2005-02-18T01:36:47Z
"Global Dynamical Evolution of the ISM in Star Forming Galaxies - I. High
  Resolution 3D HD and MHD Simulations: Effect of the Magnetic Field","In star forming disk galaxies, matter circulation between stars and the
interstellar gas, and, in particular the energy input by random and clustered
supernova explosions, determine the dynamical and chemical evolution of the
ISM, and hence of the galaxy as a whole. Using a 3D MHD code with adaptive mesh
refinement developed for this purpose, we have investigated the r\^ole of
magnetized matter circulation between the gaseous disk and the surrounding
galactic halo. Special emphasis has been put on the effect of the magnetic
field with respect to the volume and mass fractions of the different ISM
``phases'', the relative importance of ram, thermal and magnetic pressures, and
whether the field can prevent matter transport from the disk into the halo. The
simulations were performed on a grid with an area of 1 kpc$^{2}$, centered on
the solar circle, extending $\pm 10$ kpc perpendicular to the galactic disk
with a resolution as high as 1.25 pc. The simulations were run for a time scale
of 400 Myr, sufficiently long to avoid memory effects of the initial setup, and
to allow for a global dynamical equilibrium to be reached in case of a constant
energy input rate. (...) We find that in general gas transport into the halo in
3D is not prevented by an initial disk parallel magnetic field, but only
delayed initially, for as long as it is needed to punch holes into the thick
magnetized gas disk. The mean volume filling factor of the hot phase in the
disk is similar in HD and MHD (the latter with a total field strength of 4.4
$\mu$G) runs, amounting to $\sim 17-21%$ for the Galactic supernova rate.",2005-02-16T20:58:50Z

"Density-potential pairs for spherical stellar systems with Sersic
  light-profiles and (optional) power-law cores","Popular models for describing the luminosity-density profiles of dynamically
hot stellar systems (e.g., Jaffe, Hernquist, Dehnen) were constructed with the
desire to match the deprojected form of an R^{1/4} light-profile. Real
galaxies, however, are now known to have a range of different light-profile
shapes that scale with mass. Consequently, although highly useful, the above
models have implicit limitations, and this is illustrated here through their
application to a number of real galaxy density profiles. On the other hand, the
analytical density profile given by Prugniel & Simien (1997) closely matches
the deprojected form of Sersic R^{1/n} light-profiles - including deprojected
exponential light-profiles. It is thus applicable for describing bulges in
spiral galaxies, dwarf elliptical galaxies, and both ordinary and giant
elliptical galaxies. Here we provide simple equations, in terms of elementary
and special functions, for the gravitational potential and force associated
with this density profile. Furthermore, to match galaxies with partially
depleted cores, and better explore the supermassive black hole / galaxy
connection, we have added a power-law core to this density profile and derived
similar expressions for the potential and force of this hybrid profile.
Expressions for the mass and velocity dispersion, assuming isotropy, are also
given. These models may also prove appropriate for describing the dark matter
distribution in halos formed from LCDM cosmological simulations.",2005-06-09T03:18:59Z
"Initial conditions to cosmological N-body simulations, or how to run an
  ensemble of simulations","The conventional method of generating initial conditions for cosmological
N-body simulations introduces a significant error in the real-space statistical
properties of the particles. More specifically, the finite box size leads to a
significant underestimate of sigma_8, the correlation function, and nonlinear
effects. I implement a method of generating initial conditions for N-body
simulations that accurately models the real-space statistical properties, such
as the mass variance in spheres and the correlation function. The method
requires running ensembles of simulations because the power in the DC mode is
no longer assumed to be zero. For moderately sized boxes, I demonstrate that
the new method corrects the underestimate in the mass variance in spheres and
the shape of the correlation function. I also argue that subtracting Poisson
noise from the power spectrum is a dangerous practice. Code to generate initial
conditions to second order in Lagrangian perturbation theory with the new
method is available at http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~esirko/ic .",2005-03-04T19:15:23Z
"Potential Vorticity Evolution of a Protoplanetary Disk with An Embedded
  Protoplanet","We present two-dimensional inviscid hydrodynamic simulations of a
protoplanetary disk with an embedded planet, emphasizing the evolution of
potential vorticity (the ratio of vorticity to density) and its dependence on
numerical resolutions. By analyzing the structure of spiral shocks made by the
planet, we show that progressive changes of the potential vorticity caused by
spiral shocks ultimately lead to the excitation of a secondary instability. We
also demonstrate that very high numerical resolution is required to both follow
the potential vorticity changes and identify the location where the secondary
instability is first excited. Low-resolution results are shown to give the
wrong location. We establish the robustness of a secondary instability and its
impact on the torque onto the planet. After the saturation of the instability,
the disk shows large-scale non-axisymmetry, causing the torque on the planet to
oscillate with large amplitude. The impact of the oscillating torque on the
protoplanet's migration remains to be investigated.",2005-03-18T00:19:16Z
Radiative transfer in decomposed domains,"An efficient algorithm for calculating radiative transfer on massively
parallel computers using domain decomposition is presented. The integral
formulation of the transfer equation is used to divide the problem into a local
but compute-intensive part for calculating the intensity and optical depth
integrals, and a nonlocal part for communicating the intensity between adjacent
processors. The waiting time of idle processors during the nonlocal
communication part does not have a severe impact on the scaling. The wall clock
time thus scales nearly linearly with the inverse number of processors.",2005-03-23T21:08:08Z
Magnetic flux captured by an accretion disk,"We suggest a possible mechanism of efficient transport of the large-scale
external magnetic flux inward through a turbulent accretion disk. The outward
drift by turbulent diffusion which limits the effectiveness of this process is
reduced if the external flux passes through the disk in concentrated patches.
Angular momentum loss by a magnetocentrifugal wind from these patches of strong
field adds to the inward drift. We propose that magnetic flux accumulating in
this way at the center of the disk provides the `second parameter' determining
X-ray spectral states of black hole binaries, and the presence of relativistic
outflows.",2005-04-20T04:56:10Z
"Constraints on holographic dark energy from type Ia supernova
  observations","In this paper, we use the type Ia supernovae data to constrain the
holographic dark energy model proposed by Li. We also apply a cosmic age test
to this analysis. We consider in this paper a spatially flat
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe with matter component and holographic dark
energy component. The fit result shows that the case $c<1$ ($c=0.21$) is
favored, which implies that the holographic dark energy behaves as a
quintom-type dark energy. Furthermore, we also perform a joint analysis of
SNe+CMB+LSS to this model; the result is well improved, and still upholds the
quintom dark energy conclusion. The best fit results in our analysis are
$c=0.81$, $\Omega_m^0=0.28$, and $h=0.65$, which lead to the present equation
of state of dark energy $w_0=-1.03$ and the deceleration/acceleration
transition redshift $z_T=0.63$. Finally, an expected SNAP simulation using
$\Lambda$CDM as a fiducial model is performed on this model, and the result
shows that the holographic dark energy model takes on $c<1$ ($c=0.92$) even
though the dark energy is indeed a cosmological constant.",2005-06-14T15:12:02Z
Rapid Dissipation of Primordial Gas from the AU Microscopii Debris Disk,"The disk around AU Microscopii, an M1 star in the Beta Pictoris Moving Group,
is extraordinarily well-suited for comparison to the Beta Pic debris disk (type
A5V). We use far-UV absorption spectroscopy of AU Mic to probe its edge-on disk
for small amounts of molecular hydrogen, the primary constituent of gas giant
planets. Our conservative upper limit on the line-of-sight H_2 column density
is 1.7 x 10^{19} cm^{-2}, which is 18.5 times lower than the limit obtained
from non-detection of sub-mm CO emission (Liu et al. 2004). In addition, there
is a hint of H_2 absorption at a column density an order of magnitude or more
below our upper limit. The H_2-to-dust ratio in the AU Mic disk is < 6:1,
similar to that in the Beta Pic disk. This shows that the primordial gas has
largely been dissipated in less than about 12 Myr for both disks, despite their
very different stellar masses and luminosities. It is extremely difficult to
form a giant planet around AU Mic with current core-accretion scenarios in such
a short time.",2005-05-13T21:40:43Z
"The High-Energy Polarization-Limiting Radius of Neutron Star
  Magnetospheres II -- Magnetized Hydrogen Atmospheres","In the presence of strong magnetic fields, the vacuum becomes a birefringent
medium. We show that this QED effect couples the direction of the polarization
of photons leaving the NS surface, to the direction of the magnetic field along
the ray's path. We analyze the consequences that this effect has on aligning
the polarization vectors to generate large net polarizations, while considering
thermal radiation originating from a thermal hydrogen atmosphere. Counter to
previous predictions, we show that the thermal radiation should be highly
polarized even in the optical. When detected, this polarization will be the
first demonstration of vacuum birefringence. It could be used as a tool to
prove the high magnetic field nature of AXPs and it could also be used to
constrain physical NS parameters, such as $R/M$, to which the net polarization
is sensitive.",2005-02-17T15:08:28Z
Magnetorotational Instability around a Rotating Black Hole,"The magnetorotational instability(MRI) in the Kerr spacetime is studied on a
3+1 viewpoint. The Maxwell's equations are expressed in a circularly orbiting
observer's frame that co-rotates with matter in Keplerian orbits. There exist
large proper growth rates in MRI around a rapidly rotating black hole. The
large ""centrifugal force"" and the rapid variations of magnetic fields are
caused by the rotation of spacetime geometry. As the result, in the extreme
Kerr case the maximum proper growth rate at $r=r_{ms}$ becomes about twelve
times as large as that in Schwartzshield case.",2005-04-01T14:08:25Z
"Abundances of Na, Mg and Al in stars with giant planets","We present Na, Mg and Al abundances in a set of 98 stars with known giant
planets, and in a comparison sample of 41 ``single'' stars. The results show
that the [X/H] abundances (with X = Na, Mg and Al) are, on average, higher in
stars with giant planets, a result similar to the one found for iron. However,
we did not find any strong difference in the [X/Fe] ratios, for a fixed [Fe/H],
between the two samples of stars in the region where the samples overlap.
Finally, the data was used to study the Galactic chemical evolution trends for
Na, Mg and Al, and to discuss the possible influence of planets on this
evolution. The results, in general similar to the ones obtained by other
authors, show that the [X/Fe] ratios all decrease as a function of metallicity
up to solar values. While for Mg and Al this trend then becomes relatively
constant, for Na we find indications of an upturn up to [Fe/H] values close to
0.25dex. For metallicities above this value the [Na/Fe] becomes constant.",2005-04-06T18:35:19Z
"Evidence for Orbital Motion of Material Close to the Central Black Hole
  of Mrk 766","Time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy has been obtained for the narrow line
Seyfert galaxy Mrk766 from XMM-Newton observations. We present analysis in the
energy-time plane of EPIC pn data in the 4-8 keV band with energy resolution
R~50. A component of Fe Ka emission detected in the maps shows a variation of
photon energy with time that appears both to be statistically significant and
to be consistent with sinusoidal variation. We investigate the interpretation
that there exists a component of line emission from matter in a Keplerian orbit
around a supermassive black hole. The orbit has a period ~165 ks and a
line-of-sight velocity ~13,500 km/s. This yields a lower limit for the central
mass of M > 4.9x10^5 solar masses within a radius of 3.6 x 10^13 cm (2.4 A.U.).
The orbit parameters are consistent with higher black hole masses, but the lack
of any substantial gravitational redshift of the orbit implies an upper limit
to the black hole mass of 4.5x10^7 solar masses.",2005-06-09T22:53:55Z
"Geometrical Effect of Supercritical Accretion Flows: Observational
  Implications of Galactic Black-Hole Candidates and Ultraluminous X-ray
  Sources","We investigate the dependence of the viewing angle in supercritical accretion
flows and discuss the observational implications of galactic black-hole
candidates and ultraluminous X-ray sources. When the mass accretion rate
exceeds the critical rate, then the shape of the disk is geometrically thick
due to the enhanced radiation pressure. The model spectra of supercritical
accretion flows strongly depend on the inclination angle. Because the outer
disk blocks the emission from the disk inner region for high inclination angle.
We also find that the spectral properties of low-inclination angle and low
accretion-rate disks are very similar to those of high-inclination and high
accretion rate disks. That is, if an object has a high inclination and high
accretion rate, such a system suffers from self-occultation and the spectrum
will be extremely soft. Therefore, we cannot discriminate these differences
from spectrum shapes only. Conversely, if we use the self-occultation
properties, we could constrain the inclination angle of the system. We suggest
that some observed high temperature ultraluminous X-ray sources have near
face-on geometry, i < 40, and Galactic black hole candidate, XTE J1550-564,
possesses relatively high-inclination angles, i > 60.",2005-04-08T01:34:42Z
"A Highly Collimated, Young and Fast CO(2-1) Outflow in OMC1 South","We present high angular resolution (~ 1''), sensitive CO(2-1) line
observations of the region OMC1 South in the Orion Nebula made using the
Submillimeter Array (SMA). We detect the CO(2-1) high velocity outflow that was
first found by Rodriguez-Franco et al. (1999a) with the IRAM 30 m. Our
observations resolve the outflow, whose velocity-integrated emission has a
deconvolved width of 0.89'' \pm 0.06'' (490 AU) and a projected length of ~
48'' (21,000 AU) with very high redshifted and blueshifted gas with velocities
of about \pm 80 km/s. This outflow is among the most collimated (~ 3 degrees)
and youngest outflows (600 yr) that have been reported. The data show that this
collimated outflow has been blowing in the same direction during the last 600
yr. At high velocities, the CO(2-1) outflow traces an extremely collimated jet,
while at lower velocities the CO emission traces an envelope possibly produced
by entrainment of ambient gas. Furthermore, we also detect for the first time a
millimeter wavelength continuum source possibly associated with a class I
protostar that we suggest could be the possible exciting source for this
collimated outflow. However, the bolometric luminosity of this source appears
to be far too low to account for the powerful molecular outflow.",2005-05-02T23:46:32Z
Intrinsic Redshifts and the Tully-Fisher Distance Scale,"The Tully-Fisher relationship (TFR) has been shown to have a relatively small
observed scatter of ~ +/-0.35 mag implying an intrinsic scatter < +/-0.30 mag.
However, when the TFR is calibrated from distances derived from the Hubble
relation for field galaxies scatter is consistently found to be +/-0.64 to
+/-0.84 mag. This significantly larger scatter requires that intrinsic TFR
scatter is actually much larger than +/-0.30 mag, that field galaxies have an
intrinsic TFR scatter much larger than cluster spirals, or that field galaxies
have a velocity dispersion relative to the Hubble flow in excess of 1000 km
s-1. Each of these potential explanations faces difficulties contradicted by
available data and the results of previous studies. An alternative explanation
is that the measured redshifts of galaxies are composed of a cosmological
redshift component predicted from the value of the Hubble Constant and a
superimposed intrinsic redshift component previously identified in other
studies. This intrinsic redshift component may exceed 5000 km s-1 in individual
galaxies. In this alternative scenario a possible value for the Hubble Constant
is 55-60 km s-1 Mpc-1.",2005-03-20T19:17:01Z
Gravitational evolution of a perturbed lattice and its fluid limit,"We apply a simple linearization, well known in solid state physics, to
approximate the evolution at early times of cosmological N-body simulations of
gravity. In the limit that the initial perturbations, applied to an infinite
perfect lattice, are at wavelengths much greater than the lattice spacing $l$
the evolution is exactly that of a pressureless self-gravitating fluid treated
in the analagous (Lagrangian) linearization, with the Zeldovich approximation
as a sub-class of asymptotic solutions. Our less restricted approximation
allows one to trace the evolution of the discrete distribution until the time
when particles approach one another (i.e. ``shell crossing''). We calculate
modifications of the fluid evolution, explicitly dependent on $l$ i.e.
discreteness effects in the N body simulations. We note that these effects
become increasingly important as the initial red-shift is increased at fixed
$l$. The possible advantages of using a body centred cubic, rather than simple
cubic, lattice are pointed out.",2005-04-08T18:03:24Z
"On the relevance of the Tremaine-Weinberg method applied to H-alpha
  velocity field.Pattern speeds determination in M100 (NGC 4321)","The relevance of the Tremaine-Weinberg (TW) method is tested to measure the
bar, spiral and inner structure pattern speeds using a gaseous velocity field.
The TW method is applied to various simulated barred galaxies in order to
demonstrate its validity in seven different configurations, including star
formation or/and dark matter halo. The reliability of the different physical
processes involved and of the various observational parameters are also tested.
The simulations show that the TW method could be applied to the gaseous
velocity fields to get a good estimate of the bar pattern speed, under the
condition that regions of shocks are avoided and measurements are confined to
regions where the gaseous bar is well formed. We successfully apply the TW
method to the \ha velocity field of the Virgo Cluster Galaxy M100 (NGC 4321)
and derive pattern speeds of 55+/-5 km/s/kpc for the nuclear structure, 30+/-2
km/s/kpc for the bar and 20+/-1 km/s/kpc for the spiral pattern, in full
agreement with published determinations using the same method or alternative
ones.",2005-05-18T17:26:06Z
"Interpretation of the Radio/X-ray Knots of AGN Jets within the Internal
  Shock Model Framework","The dynamics of relativistically moving blobs ejected out of a central AGN,
are considered. It is assumed that the collision between two blobs are
completely inelastic, such that the bulk kinetic energy lost in the collision
is used to energize electrons to relativistic energies via acceleration in
internal shocks which are formed due to the collision. These high energy
electrons which are produced on a time-scale corresponding to the collision
time-scale, cool by radiative losses due to synchrotron and Inverse Compton
processes. The model is applied to the radio/X-ray knots of several AGN. For
three of these sources we have analyzed long (> 40 ksec) Chandra observations
and report on constrains on the X-ray spectral indices. In the framework of
this model the AGN are inferred to sporadically eject relativistic blobs on
time-scales ranging from 10^{11} to 10^{12} secs for different sources. It is
shown that the collision time-scales can be longer than the age of the knot
and, hence, non-thermal electrons are continuously being injected into the
system. This continuous injection, in contrast to an instantaneous one time
injection, gives rise to a characteristic spectral break, rather than a
high-energy cutoff in the spectrum.",2005-04-08T09:24:42Z
"Metallicity Effects on Mid-Infrared Colors and the 8 micron PAH Emission
  in Galaxies","We examine colors from 3.6 micron to 24 micron as a function of metallicity
(O/H) for a sample of 34 galaxies. The galaxies range over 2 orders of
magnitude in metallicity. They display an abrupt shift in the 8 micron to 24
micron color between metallicities 1/3 to 1/5 of the solar value. The mean 8
micron to 24 micron flux density ratio below and above 12 + log (O/H) = 8.2 is
0.08 +/- 0.04 and 0.70 +/- 0.53, respectively. We use mid-infrared colors and
spectroscopy to demonstrate that the shift is primarily due to a decrease in
the 8 micron flux density as opposed to an increase in the 24 micron flux
density. This result is most simply interpreted as due to a weakening at low
metallicity of the mid-infrared emission bands usually attributed to PAHs
(polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) relative to the small-grain dust emission.
However, existing empirical spectral energy distribution models cannot account
for the observed short-wavelength (i.e., below 8 micron) colors of the
low-metallicity galaxies merely by reducing the strength of the PAH features;
some other emission source (e.g., hot dust) is required.",2005-06-09T19:39:52Z
On the difference between type E and A OH/IR stars,"The observed SEDs of a sample of 60 OH/IR stars are fitted using a radiative
transfer model of a dusty envelope. Among the whole sample, 21 stars have
reliable phase-lag distances while the others have less accurate distances.
L*-P,Mlr-P and Mlr-L* relations have been plotted for these stars. It is found
that type E (with emission feature at 10um and type A (with absorption feature
at 10um) OH/IR stars have different L*-P and Mlr-L* relations while both of
them follow a single Mlr-P relation. The type E stars are proven to be located
in the area without large scale dense interstellar medium while the type A
stars are located probably in dense interstellar medium. It is argued here that
this may indicate the two types of OH/IR stars have different chemical
composition or zero age main sequence mass and so evolve in different ways.
This conclusion has reinforced the argument by Chen et al.(2001) who reached a
similar conclusion from the galactic distribution of about 1000 OH/IR stars
with the IRAS low-resolution spectra (LRS).",2005-03-25T08:38:03Z
Fossil records of cosmic reionization in galactic stellar halos,"Galactic stellar halos have long been considered to contain fossil
information on early dynamical and chemical evolution of galaxies. We propose
that the surface brightness distributions of old stellar halos contain the
influence of reionization on early formation histories of galaxies. By assuming
that reionization significantly suppresses star formation in small subgalactic
clumps virialized after reionization redshift ($z_{\rm reion}$), we first
numerically investigate how structural and kinematical properties of stellar
halos formed from merging of these subgalactic clumps depend on $z_{\rm
reion}$. We then discuss what observable properties of galactic stellar halos
offer us the fossil records of reionization influence on hierarchical formation
of halos based on the current results of numerical simulations. We particularly
suggest that both the half-light radius of stellar halos and the slope of their
surface brightness profile contain useful information on when star formation in
subgalactic clumps were significantly influenced by reionization. By using the
simulated surface brightness distributions of galactic stellar halos for models
with different $z_{\rm reion}$, we also discuss how wide-field imaging studies
of extragalactic halos will help us to elucidate the epoch of cosmic
reionization.",2005-05-27T08:47:26Z
"Stellar Lyman-alpha Emission Lines in the Hubble Space Telescope
  Archive: Intrinsic Line Fluxes and Absorption from the Heliosphere and
  Astrospheres","We search the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) archive for previously unanalyzed
observations of stellar H I Lyman-alpha emission lines, our primary purpose
being to look for new detections of Lyman-alpha absorption from the outer
heliosphere, and to also search for analogous absorption from the astrospheres
surrounding the observed stars. The astrospheric absorption is of particular
interest because it can be used to study solar-like stellar winds that are
otherwise undetectable. We find and analyze 33 HST Lyman-alpha spectra in the
archive. All the spectra were taken with the E140M grating of the Space
Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument on board HST. The HST/STIS
spectra yield 4 new detections of heliospheric absorption (70 Oph, Xi Boo, 61
Vir, and HD 165185) and 7 new detections of astrospheric absorption (EV Lac, 70
Oph, Xi Boo, 61 Vir, Delta Eri, HD 128987, and DK UMa), doubling the previous
number of heliospheric and astrospheric detections. When combined with previous
results, 10 of 17 lines of sight within 10 pc yield detections of astrospheric
absorption. This high detection fraction implies that most of the ISM within 10
pc must be at least partially neutral, since the presence of H I within the ISM
surrounding the observed star is necessary for an astrospheric detection. In
contrast, the detection percentage is only 9.7% (3 out of 31) for stars beyond
10 pc. Our Lyman-alpha analyses provide measurements of ISM H I and D I column
densities for all 33 lines of sight, and we discuss some implications of these
results. Finally, we measure chromospheric Lyman-alpha fluxes from the observed
stars. We use these fluxes to determine how Lyman-alpha flux correlates with
coronal X-ray and chromospheric Mg II emission, and we also study how
Lyman-alpha emission depends on stellar rotation.",2005-03-16T21:20:08Z
"Interstellar Polarization and the Position Angle Orientations of Seyfert
  1 Galaxies","We comment on recent spectropolarimetric studies that compare the observed
polarization position angles (PAs) of Seyfert 1 galaxies near H alpha with the
observed orientations of their radio source axes on the sky. For a Seyfert
galaxy in which scattering occurs mainly in an equatorial scattering region,
one expects the polarization PA to be parallel to the radio axis, while in a
case in which light scatters predominantly in the polar regions, the H alpha
polarization PA should be perpendicular to the radio axis. In practice, these
correlations are difficult to establish because a Galactic interstellar
polarization contribution can introduce a significant uncertainty into the
polarization PA determination, even when the magnitude of interstellar
polarization is small. We show how such uncertainties may affect the analysis
of PA alignments and present spectropolarimetric observations of a probe star
along the line of sight to the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 871 that allow us to assess
the intrinsic H alpha polarization and PA of Mrk 871. These results suggest
that spectropolarimetric observations of such probe stars should form an
integral part of future Seyfert galaxy polarization studies.",2005-05-27T20:00:11Z
Relic abundance of mass-varying cold dark matter particles,"In models of coupled dark energy and dark matter the mass of the dark matter

"The Evolutionary Status of Be Stars: Results from a Photometric Study of
  Southern Open Clusters","Be stars are a class of rapidly rotating B stars with circumstellar disks
that cause Balmer and other line emission. There are three possible reasons for
the rapid rotation of Be stars: they may have been born as rapid rotators, spun
up by binary mass transfer, or spun up during the main-sequence (MS) evolution
of B stars. To test the various formation scenarios, we have conducted a
photometric survey of 55 open clusters in the southern sky. Of these, five
clusters are probably not physically associated groups and our results for two
other clusters are not reliable, but we identify 52 definite Be stars and an
additional 129 Be candidates in the remaining clusters. We use our results to
examine the age and evolutionary dependence of the Be phenomenon. We find an
overall increase in the fraction of Be stars with age until 100 Myr, and Be
stars are most common among the brightest, most massive B-type stars above the
zero-age MS (ZAMS). We show that a spin-up phase at the terminal-age MS (TAMS)
cannot produce the observed distribution of Be stars, but up to 73% of the Be
stars detected may have been spun-up by binary mass transfer. Most of the
remaining Be stars were likely rapid rotators at birth.
  Previous studies have suggested that low metallicity and high cluster density
may also favor Be star formation. Our results indicate a possible increase in
the fraction of Be stars with increasing cluster distance from the Galactic
center (in environments of decreasing metallicity). However, the trend is not
significant and could be ruled out due to the intrinsic scatter in our data. We
also find no relationship between the fraction of Be stars and cluster density.",2005-05-02T18:52:53Z
"The Concordance Cosmic Star Formation Rate: Implications from and for
  the Supernova Neutrino and Gamma Ray Backgrounds","We constrain the Cosmic Star Formation Rate (CSFR) by requiring that massive
stars produce the observed UV, optical, and IR light while at the same time not
overproduce the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background as bounded by
Super-Kamiokande. With the massive star component so constrained we then show
that a reasonable choice of stellar Initial Mass Function and other parameters
results in SNIa rates and iron yields in good agreement with data. In this way
we define a `concordance' CSFR that predicts the optical SNII rate and the SNIa
contribution to the MeV Cosmic Gamma-Ray Background. The CSFR constrained to
reproduce these and other proxies of intermediate and massive star formation is
more clearly delineated than if it were measured by any one technique and has
the following testable consequences: (1) SNIa contribute only a small fraction
of the MeV Cosmic Gamma-Ray Background, (2) massive star core-collapse is
nearly always accompanied by a successful optical SNII, and (3) the Diffuse
Supernova Neutrino Background is tantalizingly close to detectability.",2005-02-07T21:52:40Z
"Chandra Observation of the Unidentified TeV Gamma-Ray Source HESS
  J1303-631 in the Galactic Plane","The imaging atmospheric Cherenkov array H.E.S.S. recently discovered an
extended source in the 0.4$-$10 TeV energy range, HESS J1303-631. We obtained a
5 ks observation with the ACIS-I array on the Chandra X-ray observatory that
does not reveal an obvious compact or diffuse X-ray counterpart. Archival ROSAT
images are also blank in this region. Although there are several radio pulsars
within the field of HESS J1303-631, none is detected in X-rays to a flux limit
of $<5 \times 10^{-14}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, and none is a likely
counterpart on energetic grounds. Over the entire $17^{\prime} \times
17^{\prime}$ ACIS-I field, we place an upper limit of $<5.4 \times 10^{-12}$
ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ on the excess diffuse flux in the 2-10 keV band. One
hard point-source with flux $\approx 4 \times 10^{-14}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$
lies within $0.^{\prime}5$ of the centroid of the TeV emission. These
exploratory observations suggest that deeper pointings with Chandra and XMM are
needed before we can learn more about the nature of HESS J1303-631. Its
similarity to the unidentified source TeV J2032+4130 indicates the probable
existence of a new class of high-energy source in the Galactic plane that
originates from young, massive stars or their supernova remnants.",2005-05-04T19:22:31Z
"Infrared Properties of AGN in the GOODS Fields: AGN in Stellar Dominated
  High-z Galaxies","We present analysis of spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from mid-infrared
through X-ray of a sample of 420 hard X-ray selected, z-band and Spitzer/IRAC
detected active galactic nuclei (AGN) and AGN candidates from the GOODS
multiwavelength survey. We fit local empirical SED templates of both normal and
active galaxies to the rest-frame luminosities calculated from spectroscopic
(where available) and photometric redshifts. The majority of the optically
stellar-dominated (with early-type galaxy fits) sources are moderately luminous
(L_X,2-10 keV ~ 10^43 erg/s) hard X-ray sources with high X-ray hardness ratios
(HR > 0.2), high MIR luminosities and red MIR colors in excess of a typical
stellar dominated elliptical galaxy. These sources likely harbor heavily
obscured (though Compton-thin) AGN. The observed ratio of obscured to
unobscured AGN has an integrated mean of ~3.4:1 but declines with increasing
redshift. This effect has been explained by Treister et al. (2004) as an
observational bias triggered by the lack of spectroscopic redshifts at R > 24
which are predominantly higher redshift obscured sources.",2005-03-02T21:17:26Z
The nature of the molecular gas system in the core of NGC 1275,"We present near-infrared integral field spectroscopy of the central
kiloparsec of NGC 1275 at the heart of the Perseus cluster of galaxies,
obtained with the UIST IFU on UKIRT. The nuclear ro-vibrational H_2 emission is
spatially resolved and is likely to originate approximately 50 pc from the
active nucleus. The Pa-alpha emission is, by contrast, spatially unresolved.
The requirements for thermal excitation of the H_2 by nuclear X-radiation, its
kinematics on sub-arcsec scales, and its stability against self-gravity,
together suggest that the observed H_2 is part of a clumpy disk rotating about
the radio-jet axis. The sharp jump in H_2 velocity across the nucleus implies a
black hole mass of 3.4E8 M(Solar), with a systematic error of 0.18 dex due to
the uncertainty in the radio jet inclination. This agrees well with the value
implied by the empirical correlation between black hole mass and stellar
velocity dispersion for nearby elliptical galaxies, and is ~100 times the
stellar mass in this region.",2005-02-25T11:39:18Z
"Pulsations, Boundary Layers, and Period Bounce in the Cataclysmic
  Variable RE J1255+266","We report time-series photometry of the quiescent optical counterpart of the
EUV transient RE J1255+266. The star appears as a DA white dwarf with bright
emission lines and a complex spectrum of periodic signals in its light curve. A
signal at 0.0829 d is likely to be the orbital period of the underlying
cataclysmic binary (probably a dwarf nova). Characteristic periods of 1344,
1236, and 668 s are seen, and a host of weaker signals. We interpret these
noncommensurate signals as (nonradial) pulsation periods of the white dwarf.
The donor star is unseen at all wavelengths, and the accretion rate is very
low. We estimate a distance of 180+-50 pc, and M_v=14.6+-1.3 for the accretion
light. The binary probably represents a very late stage of evolution, with the
donor star whittled down to M_2<0.05 M_sol. Such binaries stubbornly resist
discovery due to their faintness and reluctance to erupt, but are probably a
very common type of cataclysmic variable. If the signal at 0.0829 d is indeed
the orbital period, then the binary is an excellent candidate as a ""period
bouncer"". Plausible colleagues in this club include four dwarf novae and the
(so far) noneruptive stars GD 552 and 1RXS J105010.3-140431 (hereafter RX
1050).
  The 1994 EUV eruption implies a soft X-ray/EUV luminosity of 10^(34-35)
erg/s, greater than that of any other dwarf nova. We attribute that to a
favorable blend of properties: a high-mass white dwarf; a very transparent line
of sight (the ""Local Chimney""); and a low binary inclination. The first
maximizes the expected temperature and luminosity of boundary-layer emission;
the other two increase the likelihood that soft X-rays can survive their
perilous passage through an accretion-disk wind and the interstellar medium.",2005-02-20T20:59:46Z
"Analysis of the thin layer of Galactic warm ionized gas in the range 20
  < l < 30 deg, -1.5 < b < +1.5 deg","We present an analysis of the thin layer of Galactic warm ionized gas at an
angular resolution ~ 10'. This is carried out using radio continuum data at 1.4
GHz, 2.7 GHz and 5 GHz in the coordinate region 20 < l < 30 deg, -1.5 < b <
+1.5 deg. For this purpose, we evaluate the zero level of the 2.7 and 5 GHz
surveys using auxiliary data at 2.3 GHz and 408 MHz. The derived zero level
corrections are T_{zero}(2.7 GHz)=0.15 +/- 0.06 K and T_{zero}(5 GHz)=0.1 +/-
0.05 K. We separate the thermal (free-free) and non-thermal (synchrotron)
component by means of a spectral analysis performed adopting an antenna
temperature spectral index -2.1 for the free-free emission, a realistic spatial
distribution of indices for the synchrotron radiation and by fitting,
pixel-by-pixel, the Galactic spectral index. We find that at 5 GHz, for |b| = 0
deg, the fraction of thermal emission reaches a maximum value of 82%, while at
1.4 GHz, the corresponding value is 68%. In addition, for the thermal emission,
the analysis indicates a dominant contribution of the diffuse component
relative to the source component associated with discrete HII regions.",2005-04-25T13:51:03Z
"NGC 300: an extremely faint, outer stellar disk observed to 10 scale
  lengths","We have used the Gemini Multi-object Spectrograph (GMOS) on the Gemini South
8m telescope in exceptional conditions (0.6"" FWHM seeing) to observe the outer
stellar disk of the Sculptor group galaxy NGC 300 at two locations. At our
point source detection threshold of r' = 27.0 (3-sigma) mag, we trace the
stellar disk out to a radius of 24', or 2.2 R_25 where R_25 is the 25
mag/arcsec**2 isophotal radius. This corresponds to about 10 scale lengths in
this low-luminosity spiral (M_B = -18.6), or about 14.4 kpc at a cepheid
distance of 2.0 +/- 0.07 Mpc. The background galaxy counts are derived in the
outermost field, and these are within 10% of the mean survey counts from both
Hubble Deep Fields. The luminosity profile is well described by a nucleus plus
a simple exponential profile out to 10 optical scale lengths. We reach an
effective surface brightness of 30.5 mag/arcsec**2 (2-sigma) at 55%
completeness which doubles the known radial extent of the optical disk. These
levels are exceedingly faint in the sense that the equivalent surface
brightness in B or V is about 32 mag/arcsec**2. We find no evidence for
truncation of the stellar disk. Only star counts can be used to reliably trace
the disk to such faint levels, since surface photometry is ultimately limited
by nonstellar sources of radiation. In the Appendix, we derive the expected
surface brightness of one such source: dust scattering of starlight in the
outer disk.",2005-03-23T04:20:24Z
Multi-epoch infrared photometry of the star forming region G173.58+2.45,"We present a multi-epoch infrared photometric study of the intermediate-mass
star forming region G173.58+2.45. Photometric observations are obtained using
the near-infrared $JHKL'M'$ filters and narrow-band filters centered at the
wavelengths of H$_2$ (1-0) S(1) (2.122 $\mu$m) and [FeII] (1.644 $\mu$m) lines.
The H$_2$ image shows molecular emission from shocked gas, implying the
presence of multiple star formation and associated outflow activity. We see
evidence for several collimated outflows. The most extended jet is at least
0.25 pc in length and has a collimation factor of $\sim$ 10, which may be
associated with a binary system within the central cluster, resolved for the
first time here. This outflow is found to be episodic; probably occurring or
getting enhanced during the periastron passage of the binary. We also find that
the variable star in the vicinity of the outflow source, which was known as a
FU Ori type star, is probably not a FU Ori object. However, it does drive a
spectacular outflow and the variability is likely to be related to accretion,
when large clouds of gas and dust spiral in towards the central source. Many
other convincing accretion-outflow systems and YSO candidates are discovered in
the field.",2005-02-06T02:31:12Z
"Nearby stars from the LSPM-north Proper Motion Catalog. I. Main Sequence
  Dwarfs and Giants Within 33 Parsecs of the Sun","A list of 4,131 dwarfs, subgiants, and giants located, or suspected to be
located, within 33 parsecs of the Sun is presented. All the stars are drawn
from the new LSPM-north catalog of 61,976 stars with annual proper motions
larger than 0.15''/yr$. Trigonometric parallax measurements are found in the
literature for 1,676 of the stars in the sample; photometric and spectroscopic
distance moduli are found for another 783 objects. The remaining 1,672 objects
are reported here as nearby star candidates for the first time. Photometric
distance moduli are calculated for the new stars based on the (M_V,V-J)
relationship, calibrated with the subsample of stars which have trigonometric
parallaxes. The list of new candidates includes 539 stars which are suspected
to be within 25 parsecs of the Sun, including 63 stars estimated to be within
only 15 parsecs. The current completeness of the census of nearby stars in the
northern sky is discussed in light of the new candidates presented here. It is
estimated that 32% (18%) of nuclear burning stars within 33 parsecs (25
parsecs) of the Sun remain to be located. The missing systems are expected to
have proper motions below the 0.15''/yr limit of the LSPM catalog.",2005-06-07T20:43:27Z
Nucleosynthetic signatures of the first stars,"The chemically most primitive stars provide constraints on the nature of the
first stellar objects that formed in the Universe; elements other than
hydrogen, helium and traces of lithium within these objects were generated by
nucleosynthesis in the very first stars. The relative abundances of elements in
the surviving primitive stars reflect the masses of the first stars, because
the pathways of nucleosynthesis are quite sensitive to stellar masses. Several
models have been suggested to explain the origin of the abundance pattern of
the giant star HE 0107-5240, which hitherto exhibited the highest deficiency of
heavy elements known. Here we report the discovery of HE 1327-2326, a subgiant
or main-sequence star with an iron abundance about a factor of two lower than
that of HE 0107-5240. Both stars show extreme overabundances of carbon and
nitrogen with respect to iron, suggesting a similar origin of the abundance
patterns. The unexpectedly low Li and high Sr abundances of HE 1327-2326,
however, challenge existing theoretical understanding: none predicts the high
Sr abundance or provides a Li depletion mechanism consistent with data
available for the most metal-poor stars.",2005-03-01T15:51:16Z
Efficient radiative transfer modelling with SKIRT,"We present SKIRT, a three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer code
developed to study dusty galaxies. We discuss SKIRT's most important
characteristics and present a number of applications. In particular, we focus
on the kinematical aspect of SKIRT. We demonstrate that dust attenuation mimics
the presence of dark matter around elliptical galaxies and that it severely
affects the rotation curves of edge-on galaxies.",2005-03-22T20:53:57Z
"The effect of the Coriolis force on Kelvin-Helmholtz-driven mixing in
  protoplanetary disks","We study the stability of proto-planetary disks with vertical velocity
gradients in their equilibrium rotation rates; such gradients are expected to
develop when dust settles into the midplane. Using a linear stability analysis
of a simple three-layer model, we show that the onset of instability occurs at
a larger value of the Richardson number, and therefore for a thicker layer,
when the effects of Coriolis forces are included. This analysis also shows that
even-symmetry (midplane-crossing) modes develop faster than odd-symmetry ones.
These conclusions are corroborated by a large number of nonlinear numerical
simulations with two different parameterized prescriptions for the initial
(continuous) dust distributions. Based on these numerical experiments, the
Richardson number required for marginal stability is more than an order of
magnitude larger than the traditional 1/4 value. The dominant modes that grow
have horizontal wavelengths of several initial dust scale heights, and in
nonlinear stages mix solids fairly homogeneously over a comparable vertical
range. We conclude that gravitational instability may be more difficult to
achieve than previously thought, and that the vertical distribution of matter
within the dust layer is likely globally, rather than locally, determined.",2005-06-01T20:41:14Z
H2CO and CH3OH abundances in the envelopes around low-mass protostars,"This paper presents the third in a series of single-dish studies of molecular
abundances in the envelopes around a large sample of 18 low-mass pre- and
protostellar objects. It focuses on typical grain mantle products and organic
molecules, including H2CO, CH3OH and CH3CN. With a few exceptions, all H2CO
lines can be fit by constant abundances of 7e(-11)-8e(-9) throughout the
envelopes if ortho- and para lines are considered independently. The current
observational dataset does not require a large H2CO abundance enhancement in
the inner warm regions, but this can also not be ruled out. Through comparison
of the H2CO abundances of the entire sample, the H2CO ortho-para ratio is
constrained to be 1.6+/-0.3 consistent with thermalization on grains at
temperatures of 10-15 K. The H2CO abundances can be related to the empirical
chemical network established on the basis of our previously reported survey of
other species and is found to be closely correlated with that of the
nitrogen-bearing molecules. These correlations reflect the freeze-out of
molecules at low temperatures and high densities. An improved fit to the data
is obtained with a `drop' abundance structure in which the abundance decrease
when the temperature is lower than the evaporation temperature and the density
high enough so that the timescale for depletion is less than the lifetime of
the core. The derived abundance structures for CH3OH are consistent with a
scenario where CH3OH probes the action of compact outflows on the envelopes,
which is further supported by comparison to high frequency, high excitation CS
J=10-9 and HDO line profiles. The extent to which the outflow dominates the
abundance enhancements compared with the passively heated inner envelope
depends on the filling factors of the two components in the observing beam.",2005-03-28T21:25:09Z
"The line-of-sight velocity distributions of intracluster planetary
  nebulae in the Virgo cluster core","Radial velocities of 40 intracluster planetary nebulae (ICPNe) in the Virgo
cluster were obtained with the new multi-fiber FLAMES spectrograph on UT2 at
VLT. For the first time, the lambda 4959 AA line of the [OIII] doublet is seen
in a large fraction (50%) of ICPNe spectra, and a large fraction of the
photometric candidates with m(5007) <\= 27.2 is spectroscopically confirmed.
ICPNe with the velocity dispersion of the Virgo cluster are found in our CORE
field 1 deg from M87. These may have originated from tidal mass loss of smaller
galaxies in the M87 subcluster halo. In a field 0.25 deg from M87, we see an
extended stellar halo of M87 in approximate dynamical equilibrium, but with few
ICPNe. Finally, in a field near M84/M86, the ICPNe velocities are highly
correlated with the galaxy velocities, showing that any well-mixed intracluster
population is yet to form. Overall, the measured velocity distributions confirm
the non-uniform dynamical structure and on-going assembly of the Virgo
cluster.(Based on data collected with the FLAMES spectrograph at the UT2 of the
VLT at Cerro Paranal, Chile, operated by ESO, during observing run

"Absorption and scattering properties of arbitrarily shaped particles in
  the Rayleigh domain: A rapid computational method and a theoretical
  foundation for the statistical approach","We provide a theoretical foundation for the statistical approach for
computing the absorption properties of particles in the Rayleigh domain. We
present a general method based on the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) to
compute the absorption and scattering properties of particles in the Rayleigh
domain. The method allows to separate the geometrical aspects of a particle
from its material properties. Doing the computation of the optical properties
of a particle once, provides them for any set of refractive indices,
wavelengths and orientations. This allows for fast computations of e.g.
absorption spectra of arbitrarily shaped particles. Other practical
applications of the method are in the interpretation of atmospheric and radar
measurements as well as computations of the scattering matrix of small
particles as a function of the scattering angle. In the statistical approach,
the optical properties of irregularly shaped particles are represented by the
average properties of an ensemble of particles with simple shapes. We show that
the absorption cross section of an ensemble of arbitrarily shaped particles
with arbitrary orientations can always be uniquely represented by the average
absorption cross section of an ensemble of spheroidal particles with the same
composition and fixed orientation. This proves for the first time that the
statistical approach is generally viable in the Rayleigh domain.",2005-04-04T14:19:55Z
"Brane World Cosmology, the CMB and the Radion","Recent developments in the theory of extra dimensions have opened up avenues
to confront such theories with cosmological tests. We discuss a brane-world
model with a bulk scalar field, motivated by supergravity. The low-energy
effective action is derived and physical constraints on the parameters of the
model discussed. The cosmological evolution of the brane-world moduli is
investigated and it is shown that one of the moduli is a quintessence field.
The CMB predictions are computed. Finally, the possibility that the radion
field in brane-worlds could be a chameleon field is investigated.",2005-03-22T09:48:12Z
Be/X-ray binaries and candidates: catalogue,"We present a compilative catalogue of Be/X-ray binaries and candidates in the

"GMRT Observations of the Group Holmberg 124: Evolution by Tidal Forces
  and Ram Pressure ?","We report radio continuum and 21cm HI observations using the Giant Metrewave
Radio Telescope of the group Ho124 comprising four late-type galaxies, NGC2820,
Mrk108, NGC2814 and NGC2805. Three of the galaxies have clearly undergone tidal
interactions as seen from the various morphological tidal signatures whereas
other features in the group members appear to be due to ram pressure. Here, we
describe four interesting results:(a) detection of the tidal radio continuum
bridge at 330 MHz connecting the galaxies NGC2820+Mrk108 with NGC2814 with a
spectral index of -1.8. The radio bridge was discovered by van der Hulst &
Hummel (1985) who reported a spectral index of -0.8.(b) Detection of various
tidal features including a possible tidal dwarf galaxy.(c) Sharp truncation in
the HI distribution in the south of NGC2820 and in the HI & radio continuum in
the north of NGC2814. The optical disks in both the cases look undisturbed. (d)
Detection of a large one-sided HI loop to the north of NGC 2820. No radio
continuum emission or Halpha emission is detected. We discuss various scenarios
for the origin of this loop. The central starburst scenario is not supported
due to lack of ionized gas in the loop. For an electron density of 4x10^(-4)
cm^-3 we estimate the ram pressure force of the IGrM to be comparable to the
gravitational pull of the disk of NGC2820. We suggest that the loop could have
formed by ram pressure stripping if tidal effects had reduced the surface
density of HI in NGC2820. Finally we suggest that the evolution of the Ho124
group may be governed by both tidal forces due to the interaction and ram
pressure due to motion of the member galaxies in the IGrM and that the IGrM
densities might not be too low (>~4x10^(-4)cm^-3). This should be verified by
other observations.",2005-02-02T10:24:39Z

larger than the most luminous gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) ever detected. The
Antarctic Cherenkov neutrino detector AMANDA was on-line during the flare, and
may either have detected high energy neutrinos for the first time from a cosmic

neutrinos are detected, one would expect also detectable EeV cosmic rays and
possibly TeV gamma-ray emission in coincidence.",2005-03-11T21:54:30Z
Microlensing in the double quasar SBS1520+530,"We present the results of a monitoring campaign of the double quasar
SBS1520+530 at Maidanak observatory from April 2003 to August 2004. We obtained
light curves in V and R filters that show small-amplitude \Delta m~0.1 mag
intrinsic variations of the quasar on time scales of about 100 days. The data
set is consistent with the previously determined time delay of \Delta
t=(130+-3) days by Burud et al. (2002). We find that the time delay corrected
magnitude difference between the quasar images is now larger by (0.14+-0.03)
mag than during the observations by Burud et al. (2002). This confirms the
presence of gravitational microlensing variations in this system.",2005-05-24T13:25:26Z
"AMICA, an astro-mapper for AMS","The Alpha Magnetic Spectrograph (AMS) is a composite particle detector to be
accommodated on the International Space Station (ISS) in 2008. AMS is mainly
devoted to galactic, charged Cosmic Rays studies, Antimatter and Dark Matter
searches. Besides the main, classical physics goals, capabilities in the field
of GeV and multi-GeV gamma astrophysics have been established and are under
investigation by a number of groups. Due to the unsteadiness of the ISS
platform, a star-mapper device is required in order to fully exploit the
intrinsic arc-min angular resolution provided by the Silicon Tracker. A
star-mapper is conceptually an imaging, optical instrument able to autonomously
recognize a stellar field and to calculate its own orientation with respect to
an inertial reference frame. AMICA (Astro Mapper for Instruments Check of
Attitude) on AMS is responsible for providing real-time information that is
going to be used off-line for compensating the large uncertainties in the ISS
flight attitude and the structural degrees of freedom. In this paper, we

Astrometric Discovery of GJ 802b: In the Brown Dwarf Oasis?,"The Stellar Planet Survey is an ongoing astrometric search for giant planets
and brown dwarfs around a sample of about 30 M-dwarfs. We have discovered
several low-mass companions by measuring the motion of our target stars
relative to their reference frames. The lowest mass discovery thus far is GJ
802b, a companion to the M5-dwarf GJ 802A. The orbital period is 3.14 +/- 0.03
y, the system mass is 0.214 +/- 0.045 Msolar, and the semi-major axis is 1.28
+/- 0.10 AU or 81 +/- 6 mas. Imaging observations indicate that GJ 802b is
likely to be a brown dwarf with the astrometrically determined mass 0.058 +/-
0.021 Msolar (one sigma limits). The remaining uncertainty in the orbit is the
eccentricity that is now loosely constrained. We discuss how the system age
limits the mass and the prospects to further narrow the mass range when e is
more precisely determined.",2005-05-10T18:01:26Z
"Optical and Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectroscopy of the SCUBA
  Galaxy N2-850.4","We present optical and near-infrared integral field spectroscopy of the SCUBA
galaxy SMM J163650.43+405734.5 (ELAIS N2 850.4) at z=2.385. We combine Ly-alpha
and H-alpha emission line maps and velocity structure with high resolution HST
ACS and NICMOS imaging to probe the complex dynamics of this vigorous
star-burst galaxy. The imaging data shows a complex morphology, consisting of
at least three components separated by ~1'' (8kpc) in projection. When combined
with the H-alpha velocity field from UKIRT UIST IFU observations we identify
two components whose redshifts are coincident with the systemic redshift,
measured from previous CO observations, one of which shows signs of AGN
activity. A third component is offset by 220+/-50km/s from the systemic
velocity. The total star formation rate of the whole system (estimated from the
narrow-line H-alpha and uncorrected for reddening) is 340+/-50Mo/yr. The
Ly-alpha emission mapped by the GMOS IFU covers the complete galaxy and is
offset by +270+/-40km/s from the systemic velocity. This velocity offset is
comparable to that seen in rest-frame UV-selected galaxies at similar redshifts
and usually interpreted as a star-burst driven wind. The extended structure of
the Ly-alpha emission suggests that this wind is not a nuclear phenomenon, but
is instead a galactic scale outflow. Our observations suggest that the vigorous
activity in N2 850.4 is arising as a result of an interaction between at least
two dynamically-distinct components, resulting in a strong starburst, a
starburst-driven wind and actively-fuelled AGN activity. [abridged]",2005-02-04T12:46:12Z
On the nature of the S stars in the Galactic Center,"Davies and King have suggested that the bright stars observed on short-period
orbits about Sgr A* (``S stars'') are old, low-mass stripped AGB stars rather
than young, high-mass main-sequence stars. If the observationally inferred
effective temperatures and luminosities of these stars are correct, however,
then DK have grossly overestimated the post-AGB lifetimes and hence
underestimated the production rate in steady state. In fact, the total mass in
stars stripped over the age of the Galaxy would exceed that of the stellar cusp
bound to Sgr A*. We take issue also with Davies & King's estimates of the
energetics involved in capturing the stars onto their present orbits.",2005-04-04T19:03:23Z
"X-ray Diagnostics of Grain Depletion in Matter Accreting onto T Tauri
  Stars","Recent analysis of high resolution Chandra X-ray spectra has shown that the
Ne/O abundance ratio is remarkably constant in stellar coronae. Based on this
result, we point out the utility of the Ne/O ratio as a discriminant for
accretion-related X-rays from T Tauri stars, and for probing the measure of
grain-depletion of the accreting material in the inner disk. We apply the Ne/O
diagnostic to the classical T Tauri stars BP Tau and TW Hya--the two stars
found to date whose X-ray emission appears to originate, at least in part, from
accretion activity. We show that TW Hya appears to be accreting material which
is significantly depleted in O relative to Ne. In constrast, BP Tau has an Ne/O
abundance ratio consistent with that observed for post-T Tauri stars. We
interpret this result in terms of the different ages and evolutionary states of
the circumstellar disks of these stars. In the young BP Tau disk (age 0.6 Myr)
dust is still present near the disk corotation radius and can be ionized and
accreted, re-releasing elements depleted onto grains. In the more evolved TW
Hya disk (age 10 Myr), evidence points to ongoing coagulation of grains into
much larger bodies, and possibly planets, that can resist the drag of
inward-migrating gas, and accreting gas is consequently depleted of
grain-forming elements.",2005-06-08T20:10:53Z

"Chandra Observations of A Galactic Supernova Remnant Vela Jr.: A New
  Sample of Thin Filaments Emitting Synchrotron X-Rays","A galactic supernova remnant (SNR) Vela Jr. (RX J0852.0$-$4622, G266.6$-$1.2)
shows sharp filamentary structure on the north-western edge of the remnant in
the hard X-ray band. The filaments are so smooth and located on the most outer
side of the remnant. We measured the averaged scale width of the filaments
($w_u$ and $w_d$) with excellent spatial resolution of {\it Chandra}, which are
in the order of the size of the point spread function of {\it Chandra} on the
upstream side and 49.5 (36.0--88.8) arcsec on the downstream side,
respectively. The spectra of the filaments are very hard and have no line-like
structure, and were well reproduced with an absorbed power-law model with
$\Gamma = $2.67 (2.55--2.77), or a {\tt SRCUT} model with $\nu_{rolloff}$ = 4.3
(3.4--5.3)$\times 10^{16}$ Hz under the assumption of $p=0.3$. These results
imply that the hard X-rays are synchrotron radiation emitted by accelerated
electrons, as mentioned previously. Using a correlation between a function
${\cal B} \equiv \nu_{rolloff}/w_d^2$ and the SNR age, we estimated the
distance and the age of Vela Jr.: the estimated distance and age are 0.33
(0.26--0.50) kpc and 660 (420--1400) years, respectively. These results are
consistent with previous reports, implying that ${\cal B}$--age relation may be
a useful tool to estimate the distance and the age of synchrotron X-ray
emitting SNRs.",2005-06-15T02:11:23Z
"Discovery of a Radio Source following the 27 December 2004 Giant Flare
  from SGR 1806-20","Over a decade ago it was established that the remarkable high energy
transients, known as soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs), are a Galactic population
and originate from neutron stars with intense (<~ 10^15 G) magnetic fields
(""magnetars""). On 27 December 2004 a giant flare (fluence >~ 0.3 erg/cm^2) was
detected from SGR 1806-20. Here we report the discovery of a fading radio
counterpart. We began a monitoring program from 0.2GHz to 250GHz and obtained a
high resolution 21-cm radio spectrum which traces the intervening interstellar
neutral Hydrogen clouds. Analysis of the spectrum yields the first direct
distance measurement of SGR 1806-20. The source is located at a distance
greater than 6.4 kpc and we argue that it is nearer than 9.8 kpc. If true, our
distance estimate lowers the total energy of the explosion and relaxes the
demands on theoretical models. The energetics and the rapid decay of the radio
source are not compatible with the afterglow model that is usually invoked for
gamma-ray bursts. Instead we suggest that the rapidly decaying radio emission
arises from the debris ejected during the explosion.",2005-02-21T19:27:10Z
Hint for Quintessence-like Scalars from Holographic Dark Energy,"We use the generalized holographic dark energy model, in which both the
cosmological constant (CC) and Newton's constant G_N are scale-dependent, to
set constraints on the renormalization-group (RG) evolution of both quantities
phrased within quantum field theory (QFT) in a curved background. Considering
the case in which the energy-momentum tensor of ordinary matter stays
individually conserved, we show from the holographic dark energy requirement
that the RG laws for the CC and G_N are completely determined in terms of the
lowest part of the particle spectrum of an underlying QFT. From simple
arguments one can then infer that the lowest-mass fields should have a Compton
wavelength comparable with the size of the current Hubble horizon. Hence,
although the models with the variable CC (or with both the CC and the G_N
varying) are known tolead to successful cosmologies without introducing a new
light degree of freedom, we nonetheless find that holography actually brings us
back to the quintessence proposal. An advantage of having two different
components of the vacuum energy in the cosmological setting is also briefly
mentioned.",2005-03-23T13:53:31Z
"Chandra HETGS Multi-Phase Spectroscopy of the Young Magnetic O Star
  theta^1 Orionis C","We report on four Chandra grating observations of the oblique magnetic
rotator theta^1 Ori C (O5.5 V) covering a wide range of viewing angles with
respect to the star's 1060 G dipole magnetic field. We employ line-width and
centroid analyses to study the dynamics of the X-ray emitting plasma in the
circumstellar environment, as well as line-ratio diagnostics to constrain the
spatial location, and global spectral modeling to constrain the temperature
distribution and abundances of the very hot plasma. We investigate these
diagnostics as a function of viewing angle and analyze them in conjunction with
new MHD simulations of the magnetically channeled wind shock mechanism on
theta^1 Ori C. This model fits all the data surprisingly well, predicting the
temperature, luminosity, and occultation of the X-ray emitting plasma with
rotation phase.",2005-04-13T14:03:15Z
"HD 172189: An eclipsing and spectroscopic binary with a Delta Sct-ttype
  pulsating component in an open cluster","We present a study based on more than 2500 uvby-measurements collected on HD
172189, a new eclipsing binary system with a Delta Sct-type pulsating component
that belongs to the open cluster IC 4756. The great interest of this object
lies in that three important characteristics coexist: cluster membership,
binarity and pulsation. Its binarity and the Delta Sct-type pulsations of one
component were detected in the course of several Stromgren photometric
campaigns. The frequency analysis of all the uvby out-of-eclipse data reveals a
clear frequency of 19.5974 c/d as well as the existence of other high values in
the range 18-20 c/d. We have also carried out a first evaluation of the binary
parameters and determined a value of 5.702 d for the orbital period. An
additional potential interest of HD 172189 resides in its location in the field
of view of the COROT mission and, therefore, this star is an excellent
candidate for becoming a target for asteroseismology.",2005-06-03T11:10:18Z
"A Multi-wavelength View of the TeV Blazar Markarian 421: Correlated
  Variability, Flaring, and Spectral Evolution","We report results from a multi-wavelength monitoring campaign on Mrk 421 over
the period of 2003-2004. The source was observed simultaneously at TeV and
X-ray energies, with supporting observations frequently carried out at optical
and radio wavelengths. The large amount of simultaneous data has allowed us to
examine the variability of Mrk 421 in detail. The variabilities are generally
correlated between the X-ray and gamma-ray bands, although the correlation
appears to be fairly loose. The light curves show the presence of flares with
varying amplitudes on a wide range of timescales both at X-ray and TeV
energies. Of particular interest is the presence of TeV flares that have no
coincident counterparts at longer wavelengths, because the phenomenon seems
difficult to understand in the context of the proposed emission models for TeV
blazars. We have also found that the TeV flux reached its peak days before the
X-ray flux during a giant flare in 2004. Such a difference in the development
of the flare presents a further challenge to the emission models. Mrk 421
varied much less at optical and radio wavelengths. Surprisingly, the normalized
variability amplitude in optical seems to be comparable to that in radio,
perhaps suggesting the presence of different populations of emitting electrons
in the jet. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of Mrk 421 is seen to vary
with flux, with the two characteristic peaks moving toward higher energies at
higher fluxes. We have failed to fit the measured SEDs with a one-zone SSC
model; introducing additional zones greatly improves the fits. We have derived
constraints on the physical properties of the X-ray/gamma-ray flaring regions
from the observed variability (and SED) of the source. The implications of the
results are discussed. (Abridged)",2005-05-16T16:16:03Z
"Localizing Plages on BO Mic, First steps towards chromospheric Doppler
  imaging","We have obtained a densely sampled time series of CaII H&K line profiles of
the ultrafast rotating K-dwarf star BO Mic. Taken at high resolution, the
spectra reveal pronounced variations of the emission core profiles. We
interpret these variations as signs of concentrated chromospherically active
regions, in analogy to solar plages. We further interpret the variations as
partly due to the rapid growth and decay of plages, while other variations
appear to be caused by plages moved over the visible stellar disk by rotation.
The equivalent width of the Ca K core emission changes approximately in
anti-phase to the photospheric brightness, suggesting an association of the
chromospheric plage regions with pronounced dark photospheric spots. We believe
that further analysis of the presented spectral time series will lead to a
chromospheric Doppler image of BO mic.",2005-04-05T12:32:38Z
"Cosmological Interpretation from High Redshift Clusters Observed Within
  the XMM-Newton $Ω$-Project","During the last ten years astrophysical cosmology has brought three
remarkable results of deep impact for fundamental physics: the existence of
non-baryonic dark matter, the (nearly) flatness of space, the domination of the
density of the universe by some gravitationally repulsive fluid. This last
result is probably the most revolutionizing one: the scientific review Sciences
has considered twice results on this question as Breakthrough of the Year (for
1998 and 2003). However, direct evidence of dark energy are still rather weak,
and the strength of the standard scenario relies more on the ""concordance""
argument rather than on the robustness of direct evidences. Furthermore, a
scenario can be build in an Einstein-de Sitter universe, which reproduces as
well as the concordance model the following various data relevant to cosmology:
WMAP results, large scale structure of the universe, local abundance of massive
clusters, weak lensing measurements, most Hubble constant measurements not
based on stellar indicators. Furthermore, recent data on distant x-ray clusters
obtained from XMM and Chandra indicates that the observed abundances of
clusters at high redshift taken at face value favors an Einstein de Sitter
model and are hard to reconcile with the concordance model. It seems wise
therefore to consider that the actual existence of the dark energy is still an
open question.",2005-02-10T16:33:53Z
On gravitational lensing by quadrupole potentials,"We study gravitational lensing by quadrupole potentials within the linearized
gravity approximation and the integration over the unperturbed photon
trajectory. It is well known that the quadrupole potential contribution to the
deviation angle is much smaller than that of the monopole one. We show,
however, that quadrupole potentials can change the photon polarization vector,
but there is no contribution from the monopole term to the first order. The
effect is maximal when the axis of the quadrupole is tangential to the photon
trajectory and it is proportional to the frequency(rate) of the quadrupole
moment of the deflector. The second order correction of the monopole potential
to the polarization is canceled away by the renormalization of the polarization
vector.",2005-03-16T19:18:13Z
Options for a nondedicated mission to test the Pioneer anomaly,"The Doppler-tracking data of the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft show an
unmodelled constant acceleration in the direction of the inner Solar System.
Serious efforts have been undertaken to find a conventional explanation for
this effect, all without success at the time of writing. Hence the effect,
commonly dubbed the Pioneer anomaly, is attracting considerable attention.
Unfortunately, no other space mission has reached the long-term navigation
accuracy to yield an independent test of the effect. To fill this gap we
discuss strategies for an experimental verification of the anomaly via an
upcoming space mission. Emphasis is put on two plausible scenarios:
nondedicated concepts employing either a planetary exploration mission to the
outer Solar System or a piggybacked micro-spacecraft to be launched from a
mother spacecraft travelling to Saturn or Jupiter. The study analyses the
impact of a Pioneer anomaly test on the system and trajectory design for these
two paradigms. It is found that both paradigms are capable of verifying the
Pioneer anomaly and determine its magnitude at 10% level. Moreover the concepts
can discriminate between the most plausible classes of models of the anomaly, a
central force, a blueshift of the radio signal and a drag-like force. The
necessary adaptions of the system and mission design do not impair the
planetary exploration goals of the missions.",2005-04-28T15:19:02Z
Color and Metallicity Distributions of M81 Globular Clusters,"In this paper we present catalogs of photometric and spectroscopic data for
M81 globular clusters (GCs). The catalogs include B- and V- photometric and
reddening data of 95 GCs, and spectroscopic metallicities of 40 GCs in M81.
Using these data, we make some statistical correlations. The results show that
the distributions of intrinsic B and V colors and metallicities are bimodal,
with metallicity peaks at [Fe/H]=-1.45 and -0.53, respectively as has been
demonstrated for our Milky Way and M31. The relation between spectroscopic
metallicity and intrinsic B and V color also exists as it does for the Milky
Way and M31.",2005-03-29T10:11:15Z
The Lyman-alpha forest as a probe of fundamental physics,"We use LUQAS, a sample of 27 high resolution high signal-to-noise UVES quasar
(QSO) spectra (Kim et al. 2004), and the Croft et al. (2002) sample together
with a set of high resolution large box size hydro-dynamical simulations run
with the code GADGET-II to recover the linear dark matter power spectrum at z>2
and at scales of 1-40 Mpc/h. These scales cannot be probed by any other
observable. We address some of the uncertainties in the theoretical modelling
of the Lyman-alpha forest structures such as the difference between full
hydro-dynamical simulations and a more simplified scheme based on the HPM
(Hydro-Particle-Mesh) technique. We combine these data sets with the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) data of WMAP in order to get tighter constraints on
cosmological parameters. We focus on the recovered values of the power spectrum
amplitude, the primordial spectral index and the running of the primordial
spectral index. By considering models of slow-roll inflation we give
constraints on inflationary parameters. We explore implications for the mass of
a warm dark matter particle, including light gravitinos and sterile neutrinos,
and the perspectives of constraining the neutrino mass.",2005-04-28T18:25:29Z
"Spectral Variability of Quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. I:
  Wavelength Dependence","Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) repeat spectroscopic observations have
resulted in multiple-epoch spectroscopy for roughly 2500 quasars observed more
than 50 days apart. From this sample, we identify 315 quasars that have varied
significantly between observations. We create an ensemble difference spectrum
(bright phase minus faint phase) covering rest-frame wavelengths from 1000 to
6000 Angstroms. This average difference spectrum is bluer than the average
single-epoch quasar spectrum; a power-law fit to the difference spectrum yields
a spectral index alpha_lambda = -2.00, compared to an index of alpha_lambda =
-1.35 for the single-epoch spectrum. The strongest emission lines vary only 30%
as much as the continuum. Due to the lack of variability of the lines, measured
photometric color is not always bluer in brighter phases, but depends on
redshift and the filters used. Lastly, the difference spectrum is bluer than
the ensemble quasar spectrum only for lambda_rest < 2500 Angstroms, indicating
that the variability cannot result from a simple scaling of the average quasar
spectrum.",2005-04-13T20:56:55Z
Lyman Alpha Flux Power Spectrum and Its Covariance,"We analyze the flux power spectrum and its covariance using simulated Lyman
alpha forests. We find that pseudo-hydro techniques are good approximations of
hydrodynamical simulations at high redshift. However, the pseudo-hydro
techniques fail at low redshift because they are insufficient for
characterizing some components of the low-redshift intergalactic medium,
notably the warm-hot intergalactic medium. Hence, to use the low-redshift Lyman
alpha flux power spectrum to constrain cosmology, one would need realistic
hydrodynamical simulations. By comparing one-dimensional mass statistics with
flux statistics, we show that the nonlinear transform between density and flux
quenches the fluctuations so that the flux power spectrum is much less
sensitive to cosmological parameters than the one-dimensional mass power
spectrum. The covariance of the flux power spectrum is nearly Gaussian. As
such, the uncertainties of the underlying mass power spectrum could still be
large, even though the flux power spectrum can be precisely determined from a
small number of lines of sight.",2005-04-19T18:00:40Z
"An energetic blast wave from the December 27 giant flare of the soft
  gamma-ray repeater 1806-20","Recent follow-up observations of the December 27 giant flare of SGR 1806-20
have detected a multiple-frequency radio afterglow from 240 MHz to 8.46 GHz,
extending in time from a week to about a month after the flare. The angular
size of the source was also measured for the first time. Here we show that this
radio afterglow gives the first piece of clear evidence that an energetic blast
wave sweeps up its surrounding medium and produces a synchrotron afterglow, the
same mechanism as established for gamma-ray burst afterglows. The optical
afterglow is expected to be intrinsically as bright as $m_R\simeq13$ at $t\la
0.1$ days after the flare, but very heavy extinction makes the detection
difficult because of the low galactic latitude of the source. Rapid infrared
follow-up observations to giant flares are therefore crucial for the
low-latitude SGRs, while for high-latitude SGRs (e.g. SGR 0526-66), rapid
follow-ups should result in identification of their possible optical
afterglows. Rapid multi-wavelength follow-ups will also provide more detailed
information of the early evolution of a fireball as well as its composition.",2005-02-04T07:06:17Z
Mass loss at the lowest stellar masses,"We report the discovery of a jet in a [SII] image of Par-Lup3-4, a remarkable
M5-type pre-main sequence object in the Lupus 3 star-forming cloud. The
spectrum of this star is dominated by the emission lines commonly interpreted
as tracers of accretion and outflows. Par-Lup3-4 is therefore at the very
low-mass end of the exciting sources of jets. High resolution spectroscopy
shows that the [SII] line profile is double-peaked, implying that the low
excitation jet is seen at a small angle (probably larger than 8 degrees) with
respect to the plane of the sky. The width of the H_alpha line suggests a
dominating contribution from the accretion columns and from the shocks on the
stellar surface. Unresolved H_alpha emission coming from an object located at
4.2"" from Par-Lup3-4 is detected at a position angle ~30 degrees or ~210
degrees, with no counterpart seen either in visible or infrared images.We also
confirm previous evidence of strong mass loss from the very low mass star
LS-RCrA 1, with spectral type M6.5 or later. All its forbidden lines are
blueshifted with respect to the local standard of rest (LSR) of the molecular
cloud at a position very close to the object and the line profile of the [OI]
lines is clearly asymmetric. Thus, the receding jet could be hidden by a disk
which is not seen edge-on. If an edge-on disk does not surround Par-Lup3-4 or
LS-RCrA 1, an alternative explanation, possibly based on the effects of mass
accretion, is required to account for their unusually low luminosities.",2005-06-14T14:14:04Z
"Non-thermal X-rays, a high abundance ridge and fossil bubbles in the
  core of the Perseus cluster of galaxies","Using a deep Chandra observation of the Perseus cluster of galaxies, we find
a high-abundance shell 250 arcsec (93 kpc) from the central nucleus. This ridge
lies at the edge of the Perseus radio mini-halo. In addition we identify two
Halpha filaments pointing towards this shell. We hypothesise that this ridge is
the edge of a fossil radio bubble, formed by entrained enriched material lifted
from the core of the cluster. There is a temperature jump outside the shell,
but the pressure is continuous indicating a cold front. A non-thermal component
is mapped over the core of the cluster with a morphology similar to the
mini-halo. Its total luminosity is 4.8x10^43 erg/s, extending in radius to ~75
kpc. Assuming the non-thermal emission is the result of inverse Compton
scattering of the CMB and infrared emission from NGC 1275, we map the magnetic
field over the core of the cluster.",2005-03-15T15:27:33Z
"Spectral energy distribution of the metagalactic ionizing radiation
  field from QSO absorption spectra","A computational procedure is presented to estimate the spectral shape of the
ionizing background between 1 and 10 Ryd by analyzing optically thin absorption
systems in the spectra of high redshift quasars. The procedure is based on the
response surface methodology from the theory of experimental design. The shape
of the recovered UV background at z~3 shows a significant intensity decrease
between 3 and 4 Ryd compared to the metagalactic spectrum of Haardt & Madau
(1996). This decrease is interpreted as produced by HeII Gunn-Peterson effect.
There are no features indicating a contribution from galaxies to the UV
background which is therefore dominated by QSOs at z~3.",2005-06-07T09:01:40Z
Spectroscopic binaries with elliptical orbits,"The radial velocity curves of many spectroscopic binaries (SBs) are perturbed
by gas streams or proximity effects. For SBs with circular orbits, these
perturbations can give rise to spurious orbital eccentricities of high
statistical significance. But tests to identify such anomalous orbits can be
constructed since perturbed velocity curves are in general no longer Keplerian.
The derived tests are applied both to synthetic and to observed velocity
curves.",2005-05-11T11:01:24Z
The creation of the Helix planetary nebula (NGC 7293) by multiple events,"A deep, continuum-subtracted, image of NGC 7293 has been obtained in the
light of the Halpha+[N II] emission lines. New images of two filamentary halo
stuctures have been obtained and the possible detection of a collimated outflow
made. Spatially resolved, longslit profiles of the Halpha+[N II] lines have
been observed across several of these features with the MES combined with the
SPM 2.1m telescope; these are compared with the [N II]6584, [O III]5007, HeII
6560 and Halpha profiles obtained over the nebular core. The central HeII
emission is originating in a ~0.34pc diameter spherical volume expanding at
<=12km/s which is surrounded, and partially coincident with an [O III] emitting
inner shell expanding at 12km/s. The bright helical structure surrounding this
inner region is modelled as a bi-polar nebula with lobe expansions of 25km/s
whose axis is tilted at 37deg to the sight line but with a toroidal waist
itself expanding at 14 km/s. These observations are compared with the
expectations of the interacting two winds model for the formation of PNe. Only
after the fast wind has switched off could this global velocity structure be
generated. Ablated flows must complicate any interpretation. It is suggested
that the clumpy nature of much of the material could play a part in creating
the radial `spokes' shown here to be apparently present close to the central
star. These `spokes' could in fact be the persistant tails of cometary globules
whose heads have now photo-evaporated completely. A halo arc projecting from
the north-east of the bright core has a conterpart to the south-east. Anomolies
in the position-velocity arrays of line profiles could suggest that these are
part of an expanding disc not aligned with the central helical structure though
expanding bi-polar lobes along a tilted axis are not ruled out.",2005-04-13T13:47:56Z
"GRB jets inside and outside the star: precursors and cosmological
  implications","After many years of speculation, recent observations have confirmed the
association of gamma-ray bursts with core-collapse supernova explosions from
massive stars. This association carries with it important consequences. The
burst relativistic jet has to propagate through the cold dense stellar material
before it reaches the transparency radius and the burst photons are produced.
This propagation is likely to affect the initial properties of the jet, shaping
it and changing its energy composition. The variability injected at the base of
the jet is also likely to be erased by the jet-star interaction. Despite this,
GRBs seem to have remarkably predictable properties once the radiative phase
sets in, as emphasized by the recent discovery of several tight correlation
between spectral, geometric and energetic properties of the jet. In this
contribution we discuss the jet interaction with the star, emphasizing its
time-dependent properties and the resulting energy distribution. We finally
emphasize the surprising predictability of jet and radiation properties outside
the star and underline its implication for standardizing the GRB candle.",2005-03-29T20:57:59Z
Young Neutron Stars and Their Wind Nebulae,"With Teragauss magnetic fields, surface gravity sufficiently strong to
significantly modify light paths, central densities higher than that of a
standard nucleus, and rotation periods of only hundredths of a second, young
neutron stars are sites of some of the most extreme physical conditions known
in the Universe. They generate magnetic winds with particles that are
accelerated to energies in excess of a TeV. These winds form
synchrotron-emitting bubbles as the particle stream is eventually decelerated
to match the general expansion caused by the explosion that formed the neutron
stars. The structure of these pulsar wind nebulae allow us to infer properties
of the winds and the pulsating neutron stars themselves. The surfaces of the
the stars radiate energy from the rapidly cooling interiors where the physical
structure is basically unknown because of our imprecise knowledge of the strong
interaction at ultrahigh densities. Here I present a summary of recent
measurements that allow us to infer the birth properties of neutron stars and
to probe the nature of their winds, the physics of their atmospheres, and the
structure of their interiors.",2005-05-24T21:03:30Z
Evidence for an X-Ray Jet in DG Tau A?,"We present evidence for an X-ray jet in the T Tau star DG Tau A based on
Chandra ACIS data. DG Tau A, a jet-driving classical T Tau star with a flat
infrared spectrum, reveals an unusual X-ray spectrum that requires two thermal
components with different intervening absorption column densities. The softer
component shows a low temperature of T \approx 2.9 MK, and its absorption is
compatible with the stellar optical extinction (hydrogen column density N_H
\approx 5x10^21 cm^-2). In contrast, the harder component reveals a temperature
(22 MK) characteristic for active T Tau stars but its emission is more strongly
absorbed (N_H \approx 2.8x10^22 cm^-2). Furthermore, the high-resolution ACIS-S
image reveals a weak excess of soft (0.5-2 keV) counts at distances of 2-4""
from the star precisely along the optical jet, with a suggestive concentration
at 4"" where a bow-shock-like structure has previously been identified in
optical line observations. The energy distribution of these photons is similar
to those of the stellar soft component. We interpret the soft spectral
component as originating from shocks at the base of the jet, with shock heating
continuing out to a distance of at least 500 AU along the jet, whereas the hard
component is most likely coronal/magnetospheric as in other young stellar
systems.",2005-05-09T21:05:17Z
"The metal enrichment of elliptical galaxies in hierarchical galaxy
  formation models","We investigate the metal enrichment of elliptical galaxies in the framework
of hierarchical models of galaxy formation. The semi-analytical model we use in
this Letter, which has been used to study the metal enrichment of the
intracluster medium (ICM) by Nagashima et al., includes the effects of flows of
gas and metals both into and out of galaxies and the processes of metal
enrichment due to both type Ia and type II supernovae. We adopt a solar
neighbourhood IMF for star formation in discs, but consider models in which
starbursts have either a solar neighbourhood IMF or a top-heavy IMF. We find
that the alpha-element abundance in ellipticals is consistent with observed
values only if the top-heavy IMF is used. This result is consistent with our
previous study on the metal enrichment of the ICM. We also discuss the
abundance ratio of alpha elements to iron as a function of velocity dispersion
and metallicity. We find that models with a top-heavy IMF match the alpha/Fe
ratios observed in typical L_* ellipticals, but none of the models reproduce
the observed increase of alpha/Fe with velocity dispersion.",2005-04-27T20:47:21Z
Chandra's tryst with SN 1995N,"We present the spectroscopic and imaging analysis of a type IIn supernova SN
1995N observed with the Chandra X-ray observatory on 2004 March 27. We compare
the spectrum obtained from our Chandra observation with that of the previous
observation with ASCA in 1998. We find the presence of Neon lines in the
Chandra spectrum that were not reported in the ASCA observation. We see no
evidence of Iron in both epochs. The observed absorption column depth indicates
an extra component over and above the galactic absorption component and is
possibly due to a cool dense shell between the reverse-shock and the contact
discontinuity in the ejecta. The ASCA and the ROSAT observations suggested a
non-linear behavior of the X-ray light curve. However, with the higher spatial
resolution and sensitivity of Chandra, we separate out many nearby sources in
the supernova field-of-view that had additionally contributed to the supernova
flux due to the large Point Spread Function of the ASCA. Taking out the
contribution of those nearby sources, we find that the light curves are
consistent with a linear decline profile. We consider the light curve in the
high energy band separately. We discuss our results in the context of models of
nucleosynthesis and the interaction of the shock waves with the circumstellar
medium in core collapse supernovae.",2005-05-03T10:35:13Z
Core depletion from coalescing supermassive black holes,"New measurements of the stellar-mass deficits at the centers of luminous
elliptical galaxies are presented. These were derived considering the following
observational facts. Firstly, ``core'' galaxies, which are thought to have had
their inner region depleted from the coalesence of supermassive black holes,
show an abrupt downward deviation of their inner light-profile relative to
their outer Sersic profile. Second, ``power-law'' galaxies, having undisturbed
profiles and no partially depleted core, have inner light-profiles that display
no departure from the inward extrapolation of their outer Sersic profile. The
central stellar deficits have therefore been derived from the difference in
flux between the HST-observed galaxy light-profiles and the inward
extrapolation of each galaxy's outer Sersic profile. This approach gives flux
deficits ~0.1% of the total galaxy light, and mass deficits that are ~2 times
each galaxy's central supermassive black hole mass. These results are in
agreement with the theoretical expectations of mass ejection from binary black
hole mergers and also with popular LCDM models of hierarchical galaxy
formation. It is also explained why this result is some 10 times smaller than
current observational estimates of the central mass deficit, and therefore
implies a merger history for giant elliptical galaxies that is one order of
magnitude less violent than previously suggested.",2005-03-08T10:25:51Z
Applying Machine Learning to Catalogue Matching in Astrophysics,"We present the results of applying automated machine learning techniques to
the problem of matching different object catalogues in astrophysics. In this
study we take two partially matched catalogues where one of the two catalogues
has a large positional uncertainty. The two catalogues we used here were taken
from the HI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS), and SuperCOSMOS optical survey.
Previous work had matched 44% (1887 objects) of HIPASS to the SuperCOSMOS
catalogue.
  A supervised learning algorithm was then applied to construct a model of the
matched portion of our catalogue. Validation of the model shows that we
achieved a good classification performance (99.12% correct).
  Applying this model, to the unmatched portion of the catalogue found 1209 new
matches. This increases the catalogue size from 1887 matched objects to 3096.
The combination of these procedures yields a catalogue that is 72% matched.",2005-04-01T06:42:54Z
"To see or not to see a Bow Shock: Identifying Bow Shocks with H-Alpha
  Allsky Surveys","OB-stars have the highest luminosities and strongest stellar winds of all
stars, which enables them to interact strongly with their surrounding ISM, thus
creating bow shocks. These offer us an ideal opportunity to learn more about
the ISM. They were first detected and analysed around runaway OB-stars using
the IRAS allsky survey by van Buren et al. (1995). Using the geometry of such
bow shocks information concerning the ISM density and its fluctuations can be
gained from such infrared observations. As to help to improve the bow shock
models, additional observations at other wavelengths, e.g. H-Alpha, are most
welcome. However due to their low velocity these bow shocks have a size of ~1
degrees, and could only be observed as a whole with great difficulties. In the
light of the new H-Alpha allsky surveys (SHASSA/VTSS) this is no problem any
more. We developed different methods to detect bow shocks, e.g. the improved
determination of their symmetry axis with radial distance profiles. Using two
H-Alpha-allsky surveys (SHASSA/VTSS), we searched for bow shocks and compared
the different methods. From our sample we conclude, that the correlation
between the direction of both proper motion and the symmetry axis determined
with radial distance profile is the most promising detection method. We found
eight bow shocks around HD 17505, HD 24430, HD 48099, HD 57061, HD 92206, HD
135240, HD 149757, and HD 158186 from 37 candidates taken from van Buren et al.
(1995). Additionally to the traditional determination of ISM parameters using
the standoff distance of the bow shock, another approach was chosen, using the
thickness of the bow-shock layer. Both methods lead to the same results,
yielding densities (~1 cm^{-3}) and the maximal temperatures (~10^4 K), that
fit well to the up-to-date picture of the Warm Ionised Medium.",2005-05-05T14:05:46Z
"A Measurement of the Quadrupole Power Spectrum in the Clustering of the
  2dF QSO Survey","We report a measurement of the quadrupole power spectrum in the two degree
field (2dF) QSO redshift (2QZ) survey. The analysis uses an algorithm parallel
to that for the estimation of the standard monopole power spectrum without
first requiring computation of the correlation function or the anisotropic
power spectrum. The error on the quadrupole spectrum is rather large but the
best fit value of the bias parameter from the quadrupole spectrum is consistent
with that from previous investigations of the 2dF data.",2005-05-06T07:00:35Z
The Vela Pulsar in the Ultraviolet,"We describe time-tagged observations of the Vela pulsar (PSR B0833-45) with
the HST STIS MAMA-UV detectors. Using an optimal extraction technique, we
obtain a NUV light curve and crude FUV phase-resolved spectra. The pulse is
dominated by complex non-thermal emission at all phases. We obtain approximate
spectral indices for the brightest pulse components, relate these to pulsations
observed in other wavebands, and constrain the thermal surface emission from
the neutron star. An upper limit on the Rayleigh-Jeans component at UV pulse
minimum suggests a rather low mean surface temperature T_eff^\infty <4.6 x 10^5
(d_{300}/R_{14.2})^2 K. If confirmed by improved phase-resolved spectroscopy,
this observation has significant impact on our understanding of neutron star
interiors.",2005-03-15T23:42:14Z
Radio-quiet objects in the 2QZ survey,"Co-addition of blank-field FIRST data at the location of over 8000 QSOs in
the 2QZ survey has yielded statistical detections of radio quiet QSOs with
median flux levels of 20-40microJy. We show that the total radio flux of
radio-quiet QSOs in the 2QZ is consistent with a smooth extrapolation of the
2QZ radio-loud QSO number-flux distribution based on the slope of the relation
flattening near the FIRST flux limit. However, we are unable to distinguish a
smooth extrapolation of the luminosity function to faint levels from a bimodal
luminosity function with a break close to or below the FIRST radio detection
limit. We also demonstrate that the redshift dependence of the median
radio-to-optical spectral index for these radio quiet QSOs is consistent with
that obtained for individual radio-loud 2QZ QSOs detected by FIRST.",2005-02-21T05:08:08Z
"Evidence for the presence of dust in intervening QSO absorbers from the
  Sloan Digital Sky Survey","We find evidence for dust in the intervening QSO absorbers from the spectra
of QSOs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 1. No evidence is found
for the 2175 A feature which is present in the Milky Way dust extinction curve.
The extinction curve resembles the SMC extinction curve. The observed
Delta(g-i) excess for QSOs with strong absorption systems appears to be a
result of the reddening due to dust in the intervening absorbers.",2005-04-25T05:40:22Z
"A comparison of superradiance and negative-phase-velocity phenomenons in
  the ergosphere of a rotating black hole","The propagation of electromagnetic plane waves with negative phase velocity
(NPV) in the ergosphere of a rotating black hole has recently been reported. A
comparison of NPV propagation and superradiance is presented. We show that,
although both phenomenons involve negative energy densities, there are two
significant differences between them.",2005-04-15T14:44:36Z
New Studies of the Pulsar Wind Nebula in the Supernova Remnant CTB 80,"We investigated the kinematics of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) associated
with PSR B1951+32 in the old supernova remnant CTB 80 using the Fabry-Perot
interferometer of the 6m Special Astrophysical Observatory telescope. In
addition to the previously known expansion of the system of bright filaments
with a velocity of 100-200km/s, we detected weak high-velocity features in the
H-alpha line at least up to velocities of 400-450km/s. We analyzed the
morphology of the PWN in the H-alpha, [SII], and [OIII] lines using HST data
and discuss its nature. The shape of the central filamentary shell, which is
determined by the emission in the [OIII] line and in the radio continuum, is
shown to be consistent with the bow-shock model for a significant (about 60
degrees) inclination of the pulsar's velocity vector to the plane of the sky.
In this case, the space velocity of the pulsar is twice higher than its
tangential velocity, i.e., it reaches ~500 km/s, and PSR B1951+32 is the first
pulsar whose line-of-sight velocity (of about 400 km/s) has been estimated from
the PWN observations. The shell-like H-alpha-structures outside the bow shock
front in the east and the west may be associated with both the pulsar's jets
and the pulsar-wind breakthrough due to the layered structure of the extended
CTB 80 shell.",2005-03-24T17:22:38Z
On the Horizontal Branch of the Galactic Globular NGC2808,"We present new UV (F218W) data for stars in the central region of the
Galactic globular cluster NGC2808, collected with the WFPC2 camera on board of
the Hubble Space Telescope. These data together with F439W and F555W-band data
and previous ground based observations provide a multifrequency coverage of the
cluster stellar population extending up to a distance of 1.7 times the cluster
core radius. We discuss this complete sample of stars, which includes 764 Red
Giant Branch (RGB) stars brighter than the Horizontal Branch (HB) luminosity
level, 1239 HB stars, 119 Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB), and 22 AGB-manque'
stellar structures. As already known, we find that blue HB stars separate into
three distinct groups. However, our multiband photometry indicates that several
stars in the two hotter HB groups show a flat spectrum, thus suggesting the
binarity of these objects. Artificial star experiments suggest that at most 50%
of them might be photometric blends. Moreover, at variance with previous claims
one finds that canonical Zero Age Horizontal Branch (ZAHB) models do reach
effective temperatures typical of observed hot HB stars. We also show that the
ratio between HB and RGB stars brighter than the HB luminosity level steadly
increases when moving from the cluster center to the periphery, passing from
R=1.37 +/- 0.14 in the cluster core to R=1.95 +/- 0.26 in the outer cluster
regions. We discuss the possible origin of such a radial gradient in the
context of the Blue Tails phenomenon, advancing some suggestions concerning the
clumpy stellar distribution along the HB.",2005-05-12T11:15:46Z
X-ray Emission from the Weak-lined T Tauri Binary System KH 15D,"The unique eclipsing, weak-lined T Tauri star KH 15D has been detected as an
X-ray source in a 95.7 ks exposure from the Chandra X-ray Observatory archives.
A maximum X-ray luminosity of 1.5 x 10^{29} erg s$^{-1}$ is derived in the
0.5--8 keV band, corresponding to L_{X}/L_bol = 7.5 x 10^{-5}. Comparison with
samples of stars of similar effective temperature in NGC 2264 and in the Orion
Nebula Cluster shows that this is about an order of magnitude low for a typical
star of its mass and age. We argue that the relatively low luminosity cannot be
attributed to absorption along the line of sight but implies a real deficiency
in X-ray production. Possible causes for this are considered in the context of
a recently proposed eccentric binary model for KH 15D. In particular, we note
that the visible component rotates rather slowly for a weak-lined T Tauri star
and has possibly been pseudosynchronized by tidal interaction with the primary
near periastron.",2005-06-08T12:53:11Z
On the Size Distribution of Close-In Extrasolar Giant Planets,"The precisions of extrasolar planet radius measurements are reaching the
point at which meaningful and discriminatory comparisons with theoretical
predictions are can be made. However, care must be taken to account for
selection effects in the transit surveys that detect the transiting planets for
which radius measurements are possible. Here I identify one such selection
effect, such that the number of planets with radius R_p detected in a
signal-to-noise ratio limited transit survey is proportional to R_p^alpha, with
alpha~4-6. In the presence of a dispersion sigma in the intrinsic distribution
of planet radii, this selection effect translates to bias b in the radii of
observed planets. Detected planets are, on average, larger by a fractional
amount b ~ alpha (sigma/<R_p>)^2 relative to the mean radius <R_p> of the
underlying distribution. I argue that the intrinsic dispersion in planetary
radii is likely to be in the range sigma = (0.05-0.13)R_J, where the lower
bound is that expected theoretically solely from the variance in stellar
insolation, and the upper bound is the 95% c.l. upper limit from the scatter in
observed radii. Assuming an arbitrary but plausible value of sigma/<R_p>~10%,
and thus b~6%, I infer a mean intrinsic radius of close-in massive extrasolar
planets of <R_p>=(1.03+/-0.01)R_J. This value reinforces the case for HD209458b
having an anomalously large radius, and may be inconsistent with coreless
models of irradiated giant planets.",2005-04-05T20:00:03Z
FUV Spectroscopy of the Dwarf Novae SS Cygni and WX Hydri in Quiescence,"We present time-resolved FUV spectra of the dwarf novae SS Cyg and WX Hyi in
quiescence from observations using the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope on the
Astro-1 and Astro-2 Space Shuttle missions and the Goddard High Resolution
Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. Both dwarf novae are characterized
by blue continua that extend to the Lyman limit punctuated by broad emission
lines including transitions of O VI, N V, Si IV, and C IV. The continuum of WX
Hyi can be fit with a white dwarf model with physically reasonable model
parameters, but neither system actually shows unambiguous signatures of white
dwarf emission. The shape and flux of the spectrum of SS Cyg cannot be
self-consistently reconciled with a white dwarf providing all of the FUV
continuum flux. Combination white dwarf/disk or white dwarf/optically thin
plasma models improve the fit but still do not give physically reasonable model
parameters for a quiescent dwarf nova. Assuming that the UV emission lines
arise from the disk, the line shapes indicate that surface fluxes fall roughly
as R^{-2} in both systems. Fits to the double-peaked line profiles in SS Cyg
indicate that the FUV line forming region is concentrated closer to the white
dwarf than that of the optical lines and provide no evidence of a hole in the
inner disk. Although the flux from SS Cyg was relatively constant during all of
our observations, WX Hyi showed significant variability during the GHRS
observations. In WX Hyi, the line and continuum fluxes are (with the exception
of He II) highly correlated, indicating a link between the formation mechanisms
of the line and continuum regions.",2005-05-18T19:38:09Z
PHOENIX model chromospheres of mid- to late-type M dwarfs,"We present semi-empirical model chromospheres computed with the atmosphere
code PHOENIX. The models are designed to fit the observed spectra of five mid-
to late-type M dwarfs. Next to hydrogen lines from the Balmer series we used
various metal lines, e. g. from Fe {\sc i}, for the comparison between data and
models. Our computations show that an NLTE treatment of C, N, O impacts on the
hydrogen line formation, while NLTE treatment of less abundant metals such as
nickel influences the lines of the considered species itself. For our coolest
models we investigated also the influence of dust on the chromospheres and
found that dust increases the emission line flux.
  Moreover we present an (electronically published) emission line list for the
spectral range of 3100 to 3900 and 4700 to 6800 \AA for a set of 21 M dwarfs
and brown dwarfs. The line list includes the detection of the Na {\sc i} D
lines in emission for a L3 dwarf.",2005-05-18T14:35:57Z
Formation of Massive Black Holes in Globular Clusters,"The hydrodynamic formation of massive black holes (BHs) in globular clusters
is considered. In particular, we examine the possibility of the BH formation
induced by the radiation drag that is exerted on the interstellar matter by
stellar radiation in globular clusters. The radiation drag extracts angular
momentum from interstellar gas and thus allows the gas to accrete on to the
cluster center.By incorporating the realistic chemical evolution of globular
clusters, we scrutinize the efficiency of the radiation drag to assess the
total accreted mass. As a result, we find that if a globular cluster is more
massive than $\approx 6\times 10^{6}M_{\odot}$ in the present-day stellar
component, a massive BH with $>260M_{\odot}$ can form within it. But, the
BH-to-cluster mass ratio s considerably smaller than the BH-to-bulge mass ratio
($\approx 10^{-3}$) found in galactic bulges. The results are not sensitive to
the assumed stellar initial mass function and star formation rate in the
cluster, as long as the resultant color-magnitude relation, metallicity, and
mass-to-luminosity ratio satisfy those observed in globular clusters. Hence,
the putative linear relation between BH mass and bulge mass($M_{\rm BH}-M_{\rm
bulge}$ relation) cannot be extrapolated to globular cluster systems. In the
present regime, we discuss the BH formation in M15, G1, $\omega$ Cen, the M33
nucleus, and the compact X-ray sources in M82. Finally, we argue observational
indications of the formation process of massive BHs in globular clusters. We
find that the final phase of BH growth due to the radiation drag can be
observed as ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) with $\sim 10^{41}{\rm erg} {\rm
s}^{-1}$.",2005-04-08T14:23:09Z
"Formation of Kuiper-belt binaries through multiple chaotic scattering
  encounters with low-mass intruders","The discovery that many trans-neptunian objects exist in pairs, or binaries,
is proving invaluable for shedding light on the formation, evolution and
structure of the outer Solar system. Based on recent systematic searches it has
been estimated that up to 10% of Kuiper-belt objects might be binaries.
However, all examples discovered to-date are unusual, as compared to near-Earth
and main-belt asteroid binaries, for their mass ratios of order unity and their
large, eccentric orbits. In this article we propose a common dynamical origin
for these compositional and orbital properties based on four-body simulations
in the Hill approximation. Our calculations suggest that binaries are produced
through the following chain of events: initially, long-lived quasi-bound
binaries form by two bodies getting entangled in thin layers of dynamical chaos
produced by solar tides within the Hill sphere. Next, energy transfer through
gravitational scattering with a low-mass intruder nudges the binary into a
nearby non-chaotic, stable zone of phase space. Finally, the binary hardens
(loses energy) through a series of relatively gentle gravitational scattering
encounters with further intruders. This produces binary orbits that are well
fitted by Kepler ellipses. Dynamically, the overall process is strongly favored
if the original quasi-bound binary contains comparable masses. We propose a
simplified model of chaotic scattering to explain these results. Our findings
suggest that the observed preference for roughly equal mass ratio binaries is
probably a real effect; that is, it is not primarily due to an observational
bias for widely separated, comparably bright objects. Nevertheless, we predict
that a sizeable population of very unequal mass Kuiper-belt binaries is likely
awaiting discovery.",2005-04-04T19:07:24Z
"Chandra High-Resolution X-ray Spectroscopy of the Fe K Line in the
  Seyfert 1 Galaxy NGC 3783","We report on the results of detailed X-ray spectroscopy of the Fe K region in
the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783 from five ~170 ks observations with the Chandra
high energy gratings. Monitoring was conducted over an interval of ~125 days in
2001. The combined data constitute the highest signal-to-noise Fe K spectrum
having the best velocity resolution in the Fe K band to date (FWHM ~1860 km/s).
The data show a resolved Fe K line core with a center energy of 6.397 +/- 0.003
keV, consistent with an origin in neutral or lowly ionized Fe, located between
the BLR and NLR, as found by Kaspi et al. (2002). We also find that excess flux
around the base of the Fe K line core can be modeled with either a Compton
scattering ``shoulder'' or an emission line from a relativistic accretion disk,
having an inclination angle of 11 degrees or less. This disk line model is as
good as a Compton-shoulder model for the base of the Fe K line core. In the
latter model, the column density is 7.5 [+2.7,-0.6] x 10^{23} cm^{-2}, which
corresponds to a Thomson optical depth of ~0.60. An intrinsic width of 1500
[+460,-340] km/s FWHM is still required in this model. Moreover, more
complicated scenarios involving both a Compton-shoulder and a disk line cannot
be ruled out. We confirm an absorption feature due to He-like Fe (FWHM = 6405
[+5020,-2670] km/s), found in previous studies.",2005-03-28T20:46:07Z
The core of the Canis Major galaxy as traced by Red Clump stars,"The recently-discovered stellar system in Canis Major is analysed using
He-burning Red Clump stars as tracers. Canis Major turns out to be the
strongest and most spatially confined overdensity of the whole Galactic Disc,
both in terms of number density and of statistical significance. When projected
onto the Galactic Plane, it appears as an elongated and compact overdensity
extending from l ~ 200 to l ~ 280 with a roundish core toward l ~ 240. We find
that the main body of the system has an integrated absolute magnitude M_V=-14.4
+/- 0.8, a central surface brightness \mu_{V,0} = 24.0 +/- 0.6 mag/arcsec^2 and
a line-of-sight profile peaked at D_{sun}=7.2 +/- 1.0 kpc with Half Width at
Half Maximum ~ 2.0 kpc, in excellent agreement with the results obtained with
widely different tracers (M giants and Main Sequence stars) in previous
analyses. The mean distance to the main body of Canis Major is observed to
increase with increasing Galactic longitude, from D_{sun} ~ 6.3 kpc at l ~ 225,
to D_{sun} ~ 9.3 kpc at l ~ 265, in good agreement with the predictions of our
more recent N-body simulation that models CMa as a dwarf galaxy being accreted
in a planar orbit onto the disc of the Milky Way. We confirm that the Canis
Major system has all the characteristics of the relic of a dwarf galaxy seen on
top of a large-scale overdensity that we detect all over the third and fourth
Galactic quadrants (180<l<360, with a strong maximum around l=290 and b> -5)
that is identified as the stellar component of the southern Galactic Warp...

"Direct Distances to Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud: Evidence for
  a Universal Slope of the Period-Luminosity Relation up to Solar Abundance","We have applied the infrared surface brightness (ISB) technique to derive
distances to 13 Cepheids in the LMC which span a period range from 3 to 42
days. From the absolute magnitudes of the variables calculated from these
distances, we find that the LMC Cepheids define tight period-luminosity
relations in the V, I, W,
  J and K bands which agree exceedingly well with the corresponding Galactic PL
relations derived from the same technique, and are significantly steeper than
the LMC PL relations in these bands observed by the OGLE-II Project in V, I and
W, and by Persson et al. in J and K. We find that the tilt-corrected true
distance moduli of the LMC Cepheids show a significant dependence on period,
which hints at a systematic error in the ISB technique related to the period of
the stars. We identify as the most likely culprit the p-factor which converts
the radial into pulsational velocities; our data imply a much steeper period
dependence of the p-factor than previously thought, and we derive p=1.58
(+/-0.02) -0.15 (+/-0.05) logP as the best fit from our data, with a zero point
tied to the Milky Way open cluster Cepheids. Using this revised p-factor law,
the period dependence of the LMC Cepheid distance moduli disappears, and at the
same time the Milky Way and LMC PL relations agree among themselves, and with
the directly observed LMC PL relations, within the 1 sigma uncertainties. Our
main conclusion is that the previous, steeper Galactic PL relations were caused
by an erroneous calibration of the p-factor law, and that there is now evidence
that the slope of the Cepheid PL relation is independent of metallicity up to
solar metallicity, in both optical, and near-infrared bands.",2005-03-29T22:48:57Z
Alternative Multipole Vectors for the CMB Temperature Fluctuations,"We introduce new, low-$\ell$, multipole vectors for the CMB temperature
fluctuations. A very strong alignment of the quadrupole and octopole vectors is
observed as well as a remarkably low declination of these vectors with respect
to the galactic plane.",2005-03-21T14:19:44Z
An Independent Derivation of the Oxford Jet Kinetic Luminosity Formula,"This letter presents a theoretical derivation of an estimate for a radio
source jet kinetic luminosity. The expression yields jet powers that are
quantitatively similar to a more sophisticated empirical relation published by
the Willott, Blundell and Rawlings at Oxford. The formula allows one to
estimate the jet kinetic luminosity from the measurement of the optically thin
radio lobe emission in quasars and radio galaxies. Motivated by recent X-ray
observation, the derivation assumes that most of the energy in the lobes is in
plasma thermal energy with a negligible contribution from magnetic energy (not
equipartition). The close agreement of the two independent expressions makes
the veracity of these estimates seem very plausible.",2005-03-11T16:41:30Z
Chandra Observations of the Interacting Galaxies NGC 3395/3396 (Arp 270),"In this paper we present the results of a 20 ks high resolution Chandra X-ray
observation of the peculiar galaxy pair NGC 3395/3396, a system at a very early
stage of merging, and less evolved than the famous Antennae and Mice merging
systems. Previously unpublished ROSAT HRI data are also presented. The point
source population and the hot diffuse gas in this system are investigated, and
compared with other merging galaxy pairs. 16 X-ray point sources are detected
in Arp 270, 7 of which are classified as ULXs (Lx > 10^39 erg/s). From spectral
fits and the age of the system it seems likely that these are predominantly
high mass X-ray binaries. The diffuse gas emits at a global temperature of ~0.5
keV, consistent with temperatures observed in other interacting systems, and we
see no evidence of the starburst-driven hot gaseous outflows seen in more
evolved systems such as The Mice and The Antennae. It is likely that these
features are absent from Arp 270 as the gas has had insufficient time to break
out of the galaxy disks. 32% of the luminosity of Arp 270 arises from the
diffuse gas in the system, this is low when compared to later stage merging
systems and gives further credence that this is an early stage merger.
Comparing the ULX population of Arp 270 to other merging systems, we derive a
relationship between the star formation rate of the system, indicated by Lfir,
and the number (N(ULX)) and luminosity (Lulx) of its ULX population. We find
Nulx proportional to Lfir^0.18 and Lulx proportional to Lfir^0.54. These
relationships, coupled with the relation of the point source X-ray luminosity
(Lxp) to Lk and Lfir+uv (Colbert et al. 2003), indicate that the ULX sources in
an interacting system have contributions from both the old and young stellar
populations.",2005-04-12T21:43:08Z
"Internal Alignment of the Halos of Disk Galaxies in Cosmological
  Hydrodynamic Simulations","Seven cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of disk galaxy formation are
analyzed to determine the alignment of the disk within the dark matter halo and
the internal structure of the halo. We find that the orientation of the outer
halo, beyond ~0.1 r_vir, is unaffected by the presence of the disk. In
contrast, the inner halo is aligned such that the halo minor axis aligns with
the disk axis. The relative orientation of these two regions of the halo are
uncorrelated. The alignment of the disk and inner halo appears to take place
simultaneously through their joint evolution. The disconnect between these two
regions of the halo should be taken into account when modelling tidal streams
in the halos of disk galaxies and when calculating intrinsic alignments of disk
galaxies based on the properties of dark matter halos.",2005-05-26T00:43:40Z
Coronal Electron Scattering of Hot Spot Emission Around Black Holes,"Using a Monte Carlo ray-tracing code in full general relativity, we calculate
the transport of photons from a geodesic hot spot emitter through a corona of
hot electrons surrounding a black hole. Each photon is followed until it is
either captured by the black hole or is detected by a distant observer. The
source is assumed to be a low-energy thermal emitter (T_em ~ 1 keV), isotropic
in the rest frame of a massive geodesic test particle. The coronal scattering
has two major observable effects: the Comptonization of the photon spectrum due
to the high energy electrons, and the convolution of the time-dependent light
curve as each photon is effectively scattered into a different time bin. Both
of these effects are clearly present in the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE)
observations of high frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) seen in black
hole binaries. These QPOs tend to occur when the system is in the Steep Power
Law spectral state and also show no evidence for significant power at higher
harmonic frequencies, consistent with the smoothing out of the light curve by
multiple random time delays. We present simulated photon spectra and light
curves and compare with RXTE data, allowing us to infer the properties of the
corona as well as the hot spot emitter.",2005-02-02T19:05:45Z
"The ABC of low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in Black-Hole
  Candidates: analogies with Z-sources","Three main types of low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs) have
been observed in Black Hole Candidates. We re-analyzed RXTE data of the bright
systems XTE J1859+226, XTE J1550-564 and GX 339-4, which show all three of
them. We review the main properties of these LFQPOs and show that they follow a
well-defined correlation in a fractional rms vs. softness diagram. We show that
the frequency behavior through this correlation presents clear analogies with

the inverse of the fractional rms being the equivalent of the curvilinear
coordinate Sz through the Z track.",2005-04-14T10:36:26Z
Cosmological Bounds on Spatial Variations of Physical Constants,"We derive strong observational limits on any possible large-scale spatial
variation in the values of physical 'constants' whose space-time evolution is
driven by a scalar field. The limits are imposed by the isotropy of the
microwave background on large angular scales in theories which describe space
and time variations in the fine structure constant, the electron-proton mass
ratio, and the Newtonian gravitational constant, G. Large-scale spatial
fluctuations in the fine structure constant are bounded by 2x10^-9 and
1.2x10^-8 in the BSBM and VSL theories respectively, fluctuations in the
electron-proton mass ratio by 9x10^-5 in the BM theory and fluctuations in G by
3.6x10^-10 in Brans-Dicke theory. These derived bounds are significantly
stronger than any obtainable by direct observations of astrophysical objects at
the present time.",2005-03-20T19:42:54Z
Late time failure of Friedmann equation,"It is widely believed that the assumption of homogeneity is a good zero{\it
th} order approximation for the expansion of our Universe. We analyze the
correction due to subhorizon inhomogeneous gravitational fields. While at early
times this contribution (which may act as a negative pressure component) is
perturbatively subdominant, we show that the perturbative series is likely to
diverge at redshift of order 1, due to the growth of perturbations. So, the
homogeneous Friedmann equation can not be trusted at late times. We suggest
that the puzzling observations of a present acceleration of the Universe, may
just be due to the unjustified use of the Friedmann equation and not to the
presence of a Dark Energy component. This would completely solve the
coincidence problem.",2005-03-31T20:49:42Z
"Fireballs from Quark Stars in the CFL Phase: Application to Gamma Ray
  Bursters","Recent studies of photon-generation mechanisms in the color-superconducting
Color-Flavor Locked (CFL) phase of dense quark matter have found gamma-ray
emissivities in excess of ~ 10^{50} erg cm^{-3} s^{-1} for temperatures in the
10-30 MeV range. We suggest that this property can trigger gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) and associated fireballs at the surface of hypothetical hot (newly born)
quark stars with an energy release of up to 10^{48}-10^{50} erg within a
fraction of a millisecond. If surrounded by an accretion disk following its
formation, the star's bursting activity can last from tens of milliseconds to
hundreds of seconds releasing up to 10^{52} erg in total energy. We discuss
typical features of observed GRBs within our model and explain how quark stars
in the CFL phase might constitute natural candidates for corresponding inner
engines.",2005-03-16T17:17:08Z
"Stellar Content from high resolution galactic spectra via Maximum A
  Posteriori","This paper describes STECMAP (STEllar Content via Maximum A Posteriori), a
flexible, non-parametric inversion method for the interpretation of the
integrated light spectra of galaxies, based on synthetic spectra of single
stellar populations (SSPs). We focus on the recovery of a galaxy's star
formation history and stellar age-metallicity relation. We use the high
resolution SSPs produced by PEGASE-HR to quantify the informational content of
the wavelength range 4000 - 6800 Angstroms.
  A detailed investigation of the properties of the corresponding simplified
linear problem is performed using singular value decomposition. It turns out to
be a powerful tool for explaining and predicting the behaviour of the
inversion. We provide means of quantifying the fundamental limitations of the
problem considering the intrinsic properties of the SSPs in the spectral range
of interest, as well as the noise in these models and in the data.
  We performed a systematic simulation campaign and found that, when the time
elapsed between two bursts of star formation is larger than 0.8 dex, the
properties of each episode can be constrained with a precision of 0.04 dex in
age and 0.02 dex in metallicity from high quality data (R=10 000,
signal-to-noise ratio SNR=100 per pixel), not taking model errors into account.
  The described methods and error estimates will be useful in the design and in
the analysis of extragalactic spectroscopic surveys.",2005-05-10T20:07:07Z
"X-ray synchrotron emission from the oblique shock in the jet of the
  powerful radio galaxy 3C 346","We report the first detection, with Chandra, of X-ray emission from the jet
of the powerful narrow-line radio galaxy 3C 346. X-rays are detected from the
bright radio and optical knot at which the jet apparently bends by about 70
degrees. The Chandra observation also reveals a bright galaxy-scale atmosphere
within the previously-known cluster, and provides a good X-ray spectrum for the
bright core of 3C 346. The X-ray emission from the knot is synchrotron
radiation, as seen in lower-power sources. In common with these sources, there
is evidence of morphological differences between the radio/optical and X-ray
structures, and the spectrum is inconsistent with a one-component
continuous-injection model. We suggest that the X-ray-bright knot is associated
with a strong oblique shock in a moderately relativistic, light jet, at about
20 degrees to the line of sight, and that this shock is caused by the jet
interacting with the wake in the cluster medium behind 3C 346's companion
galaxy. The general jet curvature can result from pressure gradients in the
cluster atmosphere.",2005-04-06T09:21:10Z
dEs and the dI Fundamental Plane,"Despite much work, the connection between dwarf elliptical galaxies (dEs) and
dwarf irregulars (dIs) remains unclear. Recently, we found that the surface
brightness profiles (SBPs) of dIs in the near-infrared can be well fitted with
a hyperbolic secant (sech) function. From sech fits, a tight relationship was
derived between the absolute magnitude, central surface brightness, and 21cm
line widths, which amounts to a fundamental plane for dIs. Here we examine how
closely dEs fit into the dI fundamental plane using published data for 22 dEs
in the Virgo cluster and the Local Group. Over a 9 mag interval in absolute
magnitude the dEs fall in the plane defined by the dIs. The outstanding overlap
suggests more than a casual relationship between the two classes.",2005-04-18T13:11:19Z
"A Statistically Robust 3-Sigma Detection of Non-Gaussianity in the WMAP
  Data Using Hot and Cold Spots","We present a careful frequentist analysis of one- and two-point statistics of
the hot and cold spots in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data obtained
by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). Our main result is the
detection of a new anomaly at the 3-sigma level using temperature-weighted
extrema correlation functions. We obtain this result using a simple hypothesis
test which reduces the maximum risk of a false detection to the same level as
the claimed significance of the test. We further present a detailed study of
the robustness of our earlier claim (Larson and Wandelt 2004) under variations
in the noise model and in the resolution of the map. Free software which
implements our test is available online.",2005-05-03T19:31:11Z
Theoretical Isochrones with Extinction in the K Band,"We calculate theoretical isochrones in a consistent way for five filters (K,
K', Ks, F205W, and F222M) in the atmospheric window between 1.9 and 2.5 micron
using the Padova stellar evolutionary models by Girardi et al. Even when
displayed in the same Vega magnitude system, the near-infrared colors of the
same isochrone can differ by up to 0.18 mag at its bright end, depending on the
filter. We present magnitude transformations between K-band filters as a
function of color from H and K band filters. Isochrones with extinction at K of
up to 6 mag are also presented. We find that care is needed when comparing
extinction values that are estimated using different filter sets in the K band,
in particular when comparing those of atmospheric and space filter sets:
extinction values for space filters can be in error by up to 0.3 mag. To reduce
this error, we introduce an ""effective extinction slope"" for each filter set
and isochrone model, which describes the extinction behavior of isochrones in
the color-magnitude diagram more correctly than the actual extinction law. Our
calculation also suggests that the extinction law implied by the observations
of Rieke et al. for wavelengths between the H and K bands is better described
by a power-law function with an exponent of 1.61 instead of 1.55, which is
commonly used with an assumption that the transmission functions of H and K
filters are Dirac delta functions.",2005-05-05T07:10:02Z
Crowded field 3D spectroscopy of LBV candidates in M33,"We present integral field spectroscopy of the LBV candidate stars B416 and
v532 in the local group galaxy M33. B416 is surrounded by an elongated
ring-like nebula, which has a projected radius of 20x30 pc. From the datacube
we create ionization and radial velocity maps of the nebula. The excitation of
the gas decreases towards the outer part of the ring, while the inner part of
the nebula is filled with a more excited gas. In the EW direction the ring is
seen to expand with a maximum projected velocity amplitude of about 40 km/s.
The eastern part approaches the observer. We estimate the nebula dynamical
lifetime 8*10E5 years. It could be a residual MS bubble, which indicates a
main-sequence or pre-LBV status of the star. We classify B416 as an ""iron star""
or B[e]-supergiant. In v532 an elongated nebula has been marginally detected.
The total projected size of the nebula along the main axis is 30 pc, and the
total radial velocity gradient is 44+/-11 km/s. v532 exhibits both strong
photometric and spectral variability. At the time of our observations it was in
an intermediate brightness state with a rich nitrogen spectrum. We classify
v532 as an LBV, showing LBV <-> Ofpe/WN transitions. We stress the importance
of integral field spectroscopy as the optimal technique for studying nebulae
and the evolution of LBV-like stars in nearby galaxies.",2005-03-28T08:01:37Z
The Chandra Deep Field South/GOODS survey. Optically faint X-ray sources,"We provide important new constraints on the nature and redshift distribution
of optically faint (R>25) X-ray sources in the Chandra Deep Field South Survey.
We show that we can derive accurate photometric redshifts for the
spectroscopically unidentified sources thus maximizing the redshift
completeness for the whole X-ray sample. Our new redshift distribution for the
X-ray source population is in better agreement with that predicted by X-ray
background synthesis models; however, we still find an overdensity of low
redshift (z<1) sources. The optically faint sources are mainly X-ray absorbed
AGN, as determined from direct X-ray spectral analysis and other diagnostics.
Many of these optically faint sources have high (>10) X-ray-to-optical flux
ratios. We also find that ~71% of them are well fitted with the SED of an
early-type galaxy with <z_phot>~1.9 and the remaining 29% with irregular or
starburst galaxies mainly at z_phot>3. We estimate that 23% of the optically
faint sources are X-ray absorbed QSOs. The overall population of X-ray absorbed
QSOs contributes a ~15% fraction of the [2-10] keV X-ray Background (XRB)
whereas current XRB synthesis models predict a ~38% contribution.",2005-02-25T16:39:58Z
"The Integrated Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect as the Superior Method for
  Measuring the Mass of Clusters of Galaxies","We investigate empirical scaling relations between the thermal
Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE) and cluster mass in simulated clusters of
galaxies. The simulated clusters have been compiled from four different samples
that differ only in their assumed baryonic physics. We show that the strength
of the thermal SZE integrated over a significant fraction of the virialized
region of the clusters is relatively insensitive to the detailed heating and
cooling processes in the cores of clusters by demonstrating that the derived
scaling relations are nearly identical between the four cluster samples
considered. For our synthetic images, the central Comptonization parameter
shows significant boosting during transient merging events, but the integrated
SZE appears to be relatively insensitive to these events. Most importantly, the
integrated SZE closely tracks the underlying cluster mass. Observations through
the thermal SZE allow a strikingly accurate mass estimation from relatively
simple measurements that do not require either parametric modeling or geometric
deprojection and thus avoid assumptions regarding the physics of the ICM or the
symmetry of the cluster. This result offers significant promise for precision
cosmology using clusters of galaxies.",2005-02-10T20:48:50Z
Coupled Evolution of Primordial Gravity Waves and Relic Neutrinos,"We describe analytically the cosmological evolution of primordial gravity
waves (tensor perturbations) taking into account their coupling to relic
neutrinos. We prove that as a consequence of causality the neutrino-induced
phase shift of subhorizon tensor oscillations tends on small scales to zero.
For the tensor modes that reenter the horizon in the radiation era after
neutrino decoupling we calculate the neutrino suppression factor as
1-5rho_nu/9rho+O[(rho_nu/rho)^2]. This result is consistent with the value
obtained for three neutrino flavors by Weinberg and is in agreement with
numerical Boltzmann evolution. A minimal formula with the correct asymptotic
form on small and large scales reproduces to about ten percent the evolution on
all scales probed by the CMB. A more accurate solution (in terms of elementary
functions) shows that the modes reentering the horizon in the radiation era are
slightly enhanced and the phase of their temporal oscillations is shifted by
subdominant nonrelativistic matter. The phase shift grows logarithmically on
subhorizon scales until radiation-matter equality; the accumulated shift scales
for k>>k_eq as (ln k)/k. The modes reentering the horizon after equality are,
in turn, affected by the residual radiation density. These modes follow the
naive matter-era evolution which is advanced by a redshift and scale
independent increment of conformal time. In an appendix, we introduce a general
relativistic measure of radiation intensity that in any gauge obeys a simple
transport equation and for decoupled particles is conserved on superhorizon
scales for arbitrary initial conditions in the full nonlinear theory.",2005-05-24T21:38:09Z
An Equilibrium Dark Matter Halo with the Burkert Profile,"In this paper a prescription for generating an equilibrium spherical system
depicted with cuspy density profiles is extended to a core density profile, the
Burkert profile, which is observationally more suitable to dwarfs. By using a
time-saving Monte Carlo method instead of N-body simulations, we show that the
Burkert halo initialized with the distribution function that depends only on
energy is in a practically stable equilibrium. The one generated using the
local Maxwellian approximation is unstable, where the flat core density
structure tends to steepen. This is fundamentally different from the previous
study on a halo with cuspy density profile. The deviation of the unstable
""Burkert"" from the initial Burkert profile is found to be closely related to
taking a Gaussian as the velocity distribution at any given point. The
significance of not using the local Maxwellian approximation is further
demonstrated by exploring the dynamical evolution of compact super star
clusters in the Burkert halo. In particular, the local Maxwellian approximation
will result in underestimating the dynamical friction and overestimating
sinking time scale. Accordingly, it will lead to lower probability of forming
massive bulges and young nuclear star clusters in bulgeless galaxies.",2005-05-29T07:27:57Z
"Stellar disks and halos of the edge-on spiral galaxies: NGC 891, NGC
  4144 and NGC 4244","The results of the stellar photometry of the images ACS/WFC and WFPC2 of the
HST are used to study stellar population and spatial distribution of stars in
three edge-on galaxies: NGC 891, NGC 4144 and NGC 4244. The measuring of the
number density of the old stars revealed two stellar substructures in these
galaxies: thick disk and halo. The borders of these substructures consisting
mainly of red giants, are determined by the change of number density gradient
of the old stars. The revealed halos have flattened shapes and extend up to 25
kpc from the galaxy planes. The obtained results of number density
distributions of different type stars perpendicular to the galaxy planes allow
us to verify our stellar model of spiral galaxies. Using the determination of
the tip of red giant branch (TRGB method) we have derived the following
distances: D = 9.82 Mpc (NGC 891), D = 7.24 Mpc (NGC 4144), D = 4.29 Mpc (NGC
4244).",2005-03-10T09:05:04Z
Lithopanspermia in Star Forming Clusters,"This paper considers the lithopanspermia hypothesis in star forming groups
and clusters, where the chances of biological material spreading from one solar
system to another is greatly enhanced (relative to the field) due to the close
proximity of the systems and lower relative velocities. These effects more than
compensate for the reduced time spent in such crowded environments. This paper
uses 300,000 Monte Carlo scattering calculations to determine the cross
sections for rocks to be captured by binaries and provides fitting formulae for
other applications. We assess the odds of transfer as a function of the
ejection speed and number of members in the birth aggregate. The odds of any
given ejected meteroid being recaptured by another solar system are relatively
low. Because the number of ejected rocks per system can be large, virtually all
solar systems are likely to share rocky ejecta with all of the other solar
systems in their birth cluster. The number of ejected rocks that carry living
microorganisms is much smaller and less certain, but we estimate that several
million rocks can be ejected from a biologically active solar system. For
typical birth environments, the capture of life bearing rocks is expected to
occur 10 -- 16,000 times per cluster (under favorable conditions), depending on
the ejection speeds. Only a small fraction of the captured rocks impact the
surfaces of terrestrial planets, so that only a few lithopanspermia events are
expected (per cluster).",2005-04-29T13:07:16Z
A near-IR spectrum of the DO white dwarf RE J0503-285,"We present a near-IR spectroscopic analysis of the intriguing DO white dwarf
RE J0503-285. The IR spectrum fails to reveal evidence of the presence of a
spatially unresolved, cool, late-type companion. Hence we have placed an
approximate limit on the spectral-type and mass of a putative companion (later
than M8, M<0.085Msun). This result rules out ongoing interaction between the
white dwarf and a close companion with M>0.085Msun as responsible for the
discrepancies between the observed photospheric abundances and model
predictions. As the possibility remains that there is a cooler companion lying
beyond the detection threshold of this study we use our modelling to estimate
the improvement in sensitivity offered by a Spitzer observation.",2005-06-16T14:45:51Z
The Red Giant Branch Tip and Bump of the Leo II dwarf spheroidal galaxy,"We present V and I photometry of a 9.4' X 9.4' field centered on the dwarf
spheroidal galaxy Leo II. The Tip of the Red Giant Branch is identified at
I^{TRGB}=17.83 +/- 0.03 and adopting <[M/H]> = -1.53 +/- 0.2 from the
comparison of RGB stars with Galactic templates, we obtain a distance modulus
(m-M)_0=21.84 +/- 0.13, corresponding to a distance D=233 +/- 15 Kpc. Two
significant bumps have been detected in the Luminosity Function of the Red
Giant Branch. The fainter bump (B1, at V=21.76 +/- 0.05) is the RGB bump of the
dominant stellar population, while the actual nature of the brightest one (B2,
at V=21.35 +/- 0.05) cannot be firmly assessed on the basis of the available
data, it can be due to the Asymptotic Giant Branch Clump of the main population
or it may be a secondary RGB bump. The luminosity of the main RGB bump (B1)
suggests that the majority of RGB stars in Leo II belongs to a population that
is ~4 gyr younger than the classical Galactic globular clusters. The stars
belonging to the He-burning Red Clump are shown to be significantly more
centrally concentrated than RR Lyrae and Blue Horizontal Branch stars, probing
the existence of an age/metallicity radial gradient in this remote dwarf
spheroidal.",2005-03-18T17:23:20Z
Further Evidence for Intrinsic Redshifts in Normal Spiral Galaxies,"Evidence from galaxy absolute magnitudes, linear diameters, and HyperLeda
images is presented which strongly supports the interpretation that some normal
spiral galaxies can contain large non-cosmological (intrinsic) redshifts in
excess of 5000 km s-1.",2005-03-21T13:55:18Z
"An X-ray Variable Millisecond Pulsar in the Globular Cluster 47 Tucanae:
  Closing the Link to Low Mass X-ray Binaries","We report the discovery of peculiar X-ray spectral variability in the binary
radio millisecond pulsar PSR J0024--7204W in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae.
The observed emission consists of a dominant non-thermal component, which is
eclipsed for a portion of the orbit, and a thermal component, which appears to
be persistent. We propose that the non-thermal X-rays originate in a
relativistic intrabinary shock, formed due to interaction between the
relativistic particle wind from the pulsar and matter from the main-sequence
companion star, while the thermal photons are from the heated magnetic polar
caps of the millisecond pulsar. At optical wavelengths, the emission exhibits
large-amplitude variations at the orbital period, which can be attributed to
heating of one side of the tidally-locked secondary star by the pulsar wind.
The observed X-ray and optical properties of PSR J0024--7204W are remarkably
similar to those of the low mass X-ray binary and X-ray millisecond pulsar SAX
J1808.4--3658 in quiescence. This supports the conjecture that the non-thermal
X-ray emission and optical modulations seen in the SAX J1808.4--3658 system in
a quiescent state are due to interaction between the wind from a reactivated
rotation-powered pulsar and matter from the companion star. The striking
similarities between the two systems provide support for the long-sought
connection between millisecond radio pulsars and accreting neutron star
systems.",2005-06-01T20:02:17Z
"On the Sensitivity of Deflagrations in Chandrasekhar Mass White Dwarf to
  Initial Conditions","We analyze the sensitivity of the flame propagation in a Chandrasekhar mass
white dwarf to initial conditions during the subsonic burning phase, using 2D
simulations of the full WD. Results are presented for a wide variety of initial
flame distributions including central and off-center single point and
multi-point, simultaneous and non-simultaneous, ignitions. We also examine the
effects of convective velocity field which should exist at the core before the
thermo-nuclear runaway. Our main conclusion suggests that the amounts of
burning products and their distributions through the deflagration phase are
extremely sensitive to initial conditions, much more sensitive than presented
in previous studies. In particular, we find that more complex configurations
such as even slight off-center ignitions, non-simultaneous multi-point
ignitions and velocity fields tend to favor solutions in which individual
plumes rise faster than the bulk of a typical Rayleigh-Taylor driven, unstable
burning front. The difference to previous calculations for an octant of a WD
may be understood as a consequence of the suppression of l=1,2 modes. Our
results are consistent with full star calculations by the Chicago group.
Moreover, the total amount of nuclear burning during the phase of subsonic
burning depends sensitively on the initial conditions and may cause the WD to
pulsate or to become unbound. We discuss the implications of the results on
current models for Type Ia SNe, limitations imposed by the 2-D nature of our
study, and suggest directions for further study.",2005-04-13T19:26:09Z
"Observational evidence for the presence of PAHs in distant Luminous
  Infrared Galaxies using ISO and Spitzer","We present ISOCAM 15 micron and MIPS 24 micron photometry of a sample of 16
distant Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs) characterized by a median luminosity
L(IR) 2x10^11 Lsol and redshift z = 0.7 (distributed from z = 0.1 to 1.2).
While some sources display 24/15 micron flux ratios also consistent with a
featureless continuum dominating their mid-infrared (MIR) spectral energy
distributions (SEDs), the presence of prominent emission features such as the
Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons is clearly required to explain the observed
colors for more than half of the sample. As a result, a general good agreement
is observed between the data and predictions from the local starburst-dominated
SEDs that have been used so far to constrain IR galaxy evolution. This is
consistent with the star-forming nature of LIRGs derived from previous works,
even though our approach cannot rule out the dominance of an AGN in some cases.
Our study also supports the possibility of tracing the total IR luminosity of
distant galaxies (up to z ~ 1) from their MIR emission.",2005-02-28T12:13:08Z
A companion to AB Pic at the planet/brown dwarf boundary,"We report deep imaging observations of the young, nearby star AB Pic, a
member of the large Tucana-Horologium as sociation. We have detected a faint,
red source 5.5"" South of the star with JHK colors compatible with that of a
young substellar L dwarf. Follow-up observations at two additional epochs
confirm, with a confidence level of 4.7sigma, that the faint red object is a
companion to AB Pic rather than it being a stationary background object. A low
resolution K-band spectrum indicates an early-L spectral type for the
companion. Finally, evolutionary model predictions based on the JHK photometry
of AB Pic b indicate a mass of 13 to 14 MJup if its age is ~30Myr. Is AB Pic b
a massive planet or a minimum mass brown dwarf?",2005-04-29T11:14:57Z
"GALEX UV observations of the interacting galaxy NGC 4438 in the Virgo
  cluster","We present GALEX NUV (2310 A) and FUV (1530 A) images of the interacting
galaxy NGC 4438 (Arp 120) in the center of the Virgo cluster. These images show
an extended (20 kpc) tidal tail at the north-west edge of the galaxy previously
undetected at other wavelengths, at 15-25 kpc from its nucleus. Except in the
nucleus, the UV morphology of NGC 4438 is totally different from the
Halpha+[NII] one, more similar to the X-ray emission, confirming its gas
cooling origin. We study the star formation history of NGC 4438 combining
spectro-photometric data in the UV-visible-near-IR wavelength range with
population synthesis and galaxy evolution models. The data are consistent with
a recent (~ 10 Myr), instantaneous burst of star formation in the newly
discovered UV north-western tail which is significantly younger than the age of
the tidal interaction with NGC 4435, dated by dynamical models at ~ 100 Myr
ago. Recent star formation events are also present at the edge of the northern
arm and in the southern tail, while totally lacking in the other regions, which
are dominated by the old stellar population perturbed during the dynamical
interaction with NGC 4435. The contribution of this recent starburst to the
total galaxy stellar mass is lower than 0.1%, an extremely low value for such a
violent interaction. High-velocity, off-center tidal encounters such as that
observed in Arp 120 are thus not sufficient to significantly increase the star
formation activity of cluster galaxies.",2005-02-02T15:10:11Z
Numerical biases on IMF determinations created by binning,"We detect and quantify significant numerical biases in the determination of
the slope of power laws with Salpeter (or similar) indices from
uniformly-binned data using chi-square minimization. The biases are caused by
the correlation between the number of stars per bin and the assigned weights
and are especially important when the number of stars per bin is small. This
result implies the existence of systematic errors in the values of IMFs
calculated in this way. We propose as an alternative using variable-size bins
and dividing the stars evenly among them. Such variable-size bins yield very
small biases that are only weakly dependent on the number of stars per bin.
Furthermore, we show that they allow for the calculation of reliable IMFs with
only a small total number of stars. Therefore, they are a preferred alternative
to the standard uniform-size binning.",2005-05-01T19:01:54Z
Vigorous star formation in a bulge-dominated ERO at z = 1.34,"We present near-IR spectroscopy of three Extremely Red Objects (EROs) using
the OHS/CISCO spectrograph at Subaru telescope. One target exhibits a strong
emission line which we identify as H-alpha at z = 1.34. Using new and existing
ground-based optical and near-IR imaging, and archival HST imaging, we argue
that this target is essentially an elliptical galaxy, with an old stellar
population of around 4E11 solar masses, but having a dust-enshrouded
star-forming component with a SFR of some 50--100 solar masses per yr. There is
no evidence that the galaxy contains an AGN. Analysis of a further two targets,
which do not exhibit any features in our near-IR spectra, suggests that one is
a quiescent galaxy in the redshift range 1.2 < z < 1.6, but that the other
cannot be conclusively categorised as either star-forming or quiescent.
  Even though our first target has many of the properties of an old elliptical,
the ongoing star formation means that it cannot have formed_all_ of its stellar
population at high redshift. While we cannot infer any robust values for the
star formation rate in ellipticals at z > 1 from this one object, we argue that
the presence of an object with such a high SFR in such a small sample suggests
that a non-negligible fraction of the elliptical galaxy population may have
formed a component of their stellar population at redshifts z ~ 1--2. We
suggest that this is evidence for ongoing star formation in the history of
elliptical galaxies.",2005-04-01T17:32:40Z
The luminous host galaxies of high redshift BL Lac objects,"(abridged) We present near-infrared Ks-band imaging of 13 high redshift (0.6
< z < 1.3) BL Lac objects. We clearly detect the host in eight objects, and
marginally in three others. In all cases, the host galaxy is well represented
by an r^1/4 surface brightness law. The host galaxies of high redshift BL Lacs
are large (<R(e)> ~7 kpc) and very luminous (<M(K)> = -27.9+-0.7), ~3 mag
brighter than L*, and ~1 mag brighter than brightest cluster galaxies. They are
also ~1 mag brighter than low redshift radio galaxies and appear to deviate
from their K-z relationship. On the other hand, the high luminosities agree
with the few optical studies of high redshift BL Lac hosts. The nuclear
luminosity and the nucleus-galaxy luminosity ratio of the high redshift BL Lacs
are much larger than those in low redshift BL Lacs. This may be due to either a
higher intrinsic nuclear luminosity, or enhanced luminosity because of strong
beaming. Contrary to what is observed in low redshift BL Lacs, the luminosities
of the host galaxy and of the nucleus are fairly well correlated, as expected
from the black hole mass - bulge luminosity relationship. High redshift BL Lacs
radiate with a wide range of power with respect to their Eddington luminosity,
and this power is intermediate between those in nearby BL Lacs and in luminous
radio-loud quasars. The high redshift BL Lac host galaxies appear to be ~2 mag
brighter than those at low redshift. This is likely due to a strong selection
effect in the surveys of BL Lacs that makes observable only the most luminous
sources at z > 0.5 and produces a correlation between the nuclear and the host
luminosity. However, this may also suggest strong luminosity evolution which is
inconsistent with a simple passive evolution of the host galaxies, and requires
a contribution from relatively recent star formation episodes.",2005-05-20T14:57:21Z
End-point of the rp process and periodic gravitational wave emission,"The general end-point of the rp process in rapidly accreting neutron stars is
believed to be a surface distribution of matter whose nuclear composition may
depend on position. Its evolution during compression beyond the neutron-drip
threshold density is determined by the presence of nuclear formation enthalpy
minima at the proton closed shells. At threshold, a sequence of weak
interactions with capture or emission of neutron pairs rapidly transform nuclei
to the most accessible proton closed shell. Therefore, angular asymmetries in
nuclear composition present in accreted matter at neutron drip are preserved
during further compression to higher densities provided transition rates
between closed shells are negligible. Although it has been confirmed that this
condition is satisfied for predicted internal temperatures and for the
formation enthalpy distribution used in this work, it would not be so if the
true enthalpy differences between maxima and minima in the distribution were a
factor of two smaller. For this reason, it does not appear possible to assert
with any confidence that position-dependent surface composition can lead to
significant angle-dependence of the equation of state and to potentially
observable gravitational radiation. The effect of non-radial internal
temperature gradients on angle-dependency of the equation of state is also not
quantifiable.",2005-02-09T11:54:34Z
"Tentative detection of warm intervening gas towards PKS 0548-322 with
  XMM-Newton","We present the results of a long (~93 ksec) XMM-Newton observation of the
bright BL-Lac object PKS 0548-322 (z=0.069). Our Reflection Grating
Spectrometer (RGS) spectrum shows a single absorption feature at an observed
wavelength lambda=23.33 A, which we interpret as OVI Ka absorption at z=0.058,
i.e., ~3000 km/s from the background object. The observed equivalent width of
the absorption line ~30 mA, coupled with the lack of the corresponding
absorption edge in the EPIC pn data, implies an OVI column density ~ 2 10^{16}
cm-2 and turbulence with a Doppler velocity parameter b>100 km/s. Within the
limitations of our RGS spectrum, no OVII or OV Ka absorption are detected.
Under the assumption of ionisation equilibrium by both collisions and the
extragalactic background, this is only marginally consistent if the gas
temperature is ~250,000 K, with significantly lower or higher values being
excluded by our limits on OV or OVII. If confirmed, this would be the first
X-ray detection of a large amount of intervening warm absorbing gas through OVI
absorption. The existence of such a high column density absorber, much stronger
than any previously detected one in OVI, would place stringent constraints on
the large-scale distribution of baryonic gas in the Universe.",2005-03-08T11:47:34Z
"The XMM-Newton Needles in the Haystack Survey: the local X-ray
  luminosity function of 'normal' galaxies","In this paper we estimate the local (z<0.22) X-ray luminosity function of
`normal' galaxies derived from the XMM-Newton Needles in the Haystack Survey.
This is an on-going project that aims to identify X-ray selected `normal'
galaxies (i.e. non-AGN dominated) in the local Universe. We are using a total
of 70 XMM-Newton fields covering an area of 11 sq. degrees which overlap with
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release-2. `Normal' galaxies are selected on
the basis of their resolved optical light profile, their low X-ray--to--optical
flux ratio (log(f_x/f_o)<-2) and soft X-ray colours. We find a total of 28
candidate `normal' galaxies to the 0.5-8 keV band flux limit of ~2x10^{-15}
cgs. Optical spectra are available for most sources in our sample (82 per
cent). These provide additional evidence that our sources are bona-fide
'normal' galaxies with X-ray emission coming from diffuse hot gas emission
and/or X-ray binaries rather than a supermassive black hole. Sixteen of our
galaxies have narrow emission lines or a late-type Spectral Energy Distribution
(SED) while the remaining 12 present only absorption lines or an early-type
SED. Combining our XMM-Newton sample with 18 local (z<0.22) galaxies from the
Chandra Deep Field North and South surveys, we construct the local X-ray
luminosity function of `normal' galaxies. This can be represented with a
Schechter form with a break at L* ~ 3x10^{41} cgs and a slope of ~1.78+/-0.12.
Using this luminosity function and assuming pure luminosity evolution of the
form
  (1+z)^{3.3} we estimate a contribution to the X-ray background from `normal'
galaxies of 10-20 per cent (0.5-8 keV). Finally, we derive, for the first time,
the luminosity functions for early and late type systems separately.",2005-03-23T13:01:14Z
Spitzer Mid-Infrared Imaging of Nearby Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies,"We have observed 14 nearby (z<0.16) Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs)
with Spitzer at 3.6-24 microns. The underlying host galaxies are well-detected,
in addition to the luminous nuclear cores. While the spatial resolution of
Spitzer is poor, the great sensitivity of the data reveals the underlying
galaxy merger remnant, and provides the first look at off-nuclear mid-infrared
activity.",2005-03-01T04:33:15Z
Identifying Lenses with Small-Scale Structure. II. Fold Lenses,"When the source in a 4-image gravitational lens lies close to a ""fold""
caustic, two of the lensed images lie close together. If the lens potential is
smooth on the scale of the separation between the two close images, then the
difference between their fluxes should approximately vanish, Rfold =
(F1-F2)/(F1+F2) \approx 0. Violations of this ""fold relation"" in observed
lenses are thought to indicate the presence of structure on scales smaller than
the separation between the close images. We study the fold relation and find it
to be more subtle and rich than was previously realized. The degree to which
Rfold can differ from zero for realistic smooth lenses depends not only on the
distance of the source from the caustic, but also on its location along the
caustic, and on the angular structure of the lens potential. Thus, it is
impossible to say from Rfold alone whether observed flux ratios are anomalous
or not. Instead, we must consider the full distribution of Rfold values that
can be obtained from smooth potentials that reproduce the separation between
the two close images and the distance to the next nearest image. We analyze the
generic and specific features of this distribution, and then show that 5 of the
12 known lenses with fold configurations have flux ratio anomalies: B0712+472,
SDSS 0924+0219, PG 1115+080, B1555+375, and B1933+503. Combining this with our
previous analysis revealing anomalies in 3 of the 4 known lenses with cusp
configurations, we conclude that at least half (8/16) of all 4-image lenses
that admit generic, local analyses exhibit flux ratio anomalies indicative of
small-scale structure. The fold and cusp relations do not reveal the nature of
the implied small-scale structure, but do provide the formal foundation for
substructure studies. [Abridged]",2005-03-21T21:01:04Z
Evidence for Supernova light in all Gamma-Ray Burst afterglows,"We present an update of our systematic analysis of all Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB)
afterglow data, now published through the end of 2004, in an attempt to detect
the predicted supernova light component. We fit the observed photometric light
curves as the sum of an afterglow, an underlying host galaxy, and a supernova
component. The latter is modeled using published UBVRI light curves of SN
1998bw as a template. The total sample of afterglows with established redshifts
contains now 29 bursts (GRB 970228 - GRB 041006). For 13 of them a weak
supernova excess (scaled to SN 1998bw) was found. In agreement with our earlier
result (Zeh et al. 2004) we find that also in the updated sample all bursts
with redshift < 0.7 show a supernova excess in their afterglow light curves.
The general lack of a detection of a supernova component at larger redshifts
can be explained with selection effects. These results strongly support our
previous conclusion based on all afterglow data of the years 1997 to 2002 that
in fact all afterglows of long-duration GRBs contain light from an associated
supernova.",2005-03-15T11:27:34Z
"X-rays from the Type II quasar in the hyperluminous infrared galaxy IRAS
  F15307+3252","We report the detection of X-ray emission from the hyperluminous infrared
galaxy IRAS F15307+3252 at z=0.93 and its properties obtained from XMM-Newton
observations. Although the X-ray emission is very faint and the data are noisy,
a prominent line-like feature in the observed 3-4 keV range is inferred from
both photometric and spectroscopic techniques. It indicates an X-ray spectrum
dominated by 6.4 keV Fe K emission and the presence of a Compton-thick AGN. Our
estimate of the luminosity of the illuminating source (L(2-10keV)>=1e45 erg/s),
required to produce the observed Fe K emission in reflection from cold matter,
means that the hidden quasar nucleus accounts for a significant fraction of the
large bolometric luminosity. The soft X-ray emission below 2 keV is found to be
spatially extended and probably of a separate origin. The temperature and
bolometric luminosity (kT=2 keV and L(bol,CL)=1e44 erg/s) obtained from a
thermal spectrum place this X-ray source on the L-Tx relation of galaxy
clusters. The possible association with a galaxy cluster can be added to the
list of remarkable similarities between IRAS F15307+3252 and another
hyperluminous infrared galaxy IRAS 09104+4109 (z=0.44), both of which have
bolometric luminosities dominated by hidden quasar nuclei. Our result on IRAS
F15307+3252 illustrates how difficult it is to detect Compton thick Type II
quasars at z>=1, particularly if their bolometric outputs do not rival the
hyperluminous population.",2005-06-14T13:12:27Z
The very young planetary nebula LS IV -12 111,"In the last few years we have started a systematic study aimed at detecting
very young Planetary Nebulae (YPNs). The project, based on both radio
(multi-frequency and high resolution) and optical observations, has already
provided interesting results, including the identification of new YPNs and the
observation, for the first time in PN in this very early phase of their
formation, of radio bipolar morphologies.
  In this paper we present radio and optical results on one of our targets,
namely IRAS 19590-1249 (LS IV -12 111). The analysis of spectroscopic
observations, obtained with the Anglo Australian Telescope (AAT) in different
epochs, has allowed us to conclude that the optical spectrum of this object has
evolved quite rapidly, showing, very recently, strong forbidden nebular
emission lines consistent with a young PN. This result confirms that IRAS
19590-1249, has turned into a PN within the last decades and makes this source
a perfect target for studying the early evolution and structure of Planetary
Nebulae.",2005-05-31T10:46:05Z

Superstellar clusters and their impact on their host galaxies,"We review the properties of young superstellar clusters and the impact that
their evolution has in their host galaxies. In particular we look at the two
different star-forming feedback modes: positive and negative feedback. The
development of strong isotropic winds emanating from massive clusters, capable
of disrupting the remains of the parental cloud as well as causing the
large-scale restructuring of the surrounding ISM, has usually been taken as a
negative feedback agent. Here we show the impact that radiative cooling has on
the resultant outflows and then, as an extreme example, we infer from the
observations of M82 the detailed inner structure of supergalactic winds and
define through numerical simulations the ingredients required to match such
structures.We also show how when radiative cooling becomes significant within
the star cluster volume itself (~ 30% of the deposited energy), the force of
gravity takes over and drives in situ all the matter deposited by winds and
supernovae into several generations of star formation. A situation in which the
mass deposition rate from the star cluster instead of causing a wind as in the
adiabatic solution, turns into a positive feedback star-forming mode equal to
the star formation rate.",2005-06-06T19:37:16Z
Discovery of magnetic fields in hot subdwarfs,"We present polarisation measurements of sdB and sdO stars using FORS1 on the
VLT. The observations were made as part of a project to determine whether
magnetic fields in two super-metal-rich stars can explain their extreme
abundance peculiarities. Field strengths of up to ~1.5 kG have been measured at
varying levels of significance in each of our six targets, however no clear
evidence was found between apparently normal subdwarfs and the metal-rich
objects. The origin of the magnetic fields is unknown. We also discuss the
implications of our measurements for magnetic flux conservation in late stages
of stellar evolution.",2005-03-10T13:11:28Z
"Some remarks on the angular momenta of galaxies, their clusters and
  superclusters","We discuss the relation between angular momenta and masses of galaxy
structures base on the Li model of the universe with global rotation. In our
previous paper (God{\l}owski et al 2002) it was shown that the model predicts
the presence of a minimum in this relation. In the present paper we discuss
observational evidence allowing us to verify this relation. We find null
angular momentum J=0 for the masses corresponding to mass of galaxy grups and
non-vanishing angular momenta for other galactic structures. We check these
theoretical predictions analysing Tully's galaxy grups. The existing data
comparing alignment in different galactic structure are consistent with
obtained theoretical relation $J(M)$ if we interpret the groving alignment as
the galactic increasing angular momenta in the galactic structure.",2005-02-18T18:46:20Z
Testing the massive disk scenario for IRAS 18089-1732,"Investigating in more detail the previously suggested massive disk scenario
for the High-Mass Protostellar Object IRAS18089-1732, we observed the source in
the 860mum band with the Submillimeter Array in various spectral lines and the
submm continuum emission at (sub-)arcsecond spatial resolution. Fifty spectral
lines from eighteen different species spanning upper level energy states
between 17 and 747K were detected. One of the assumed best tracers for massive
disks, CH3CN, is optically thick and does not allow a further disk
investigation. However, the complex molecule HCOOCH3 appears optically thin and
exhibits a velocity shift across the central core perpendicular to the
emanating outflow. Assuming equilibrium between centrifugal and gravitational
force, the estimated mass for this rotating structure is 16/(sin2(i))Msun (with
i the unknown inclination angle), of the same order as the gas mass derived
from the continuum emission. A temperature estimate based on the CH3CN(19--18)
K-ladder results in ~350K, thus a hot core has already formed in this region.
An analysis of the submm continuum emission reveals even at this high spatial
resolution only one isolated massive dust core without any detectable
companions down to mass limits between 0.2 and 3Msun (depending on the assumed
temperature). Potential implications for the massive cluster formation are
discussed.",2005-04-21T13:48:00Z
Early re-brightening of the afterglow of GRB 050525a,"We present time resolved optical data acquired by the TAROT automated
observatory on the afterglow of GRB 050525a from 6 to 136 minutes after the
GRB. We evidence a rapid re-brightening of 0.65 magnitude of the afterglow at
$\sim$ 33 min after the GRB. The decay slope $\alpha$ is $1.14\pm 0.07$ in the
first part and is $1.23\pm 0.27$ after the re-brightening event. The afterglow
of GRB 050525a is the third known afterglow that exhibits a re-brightening

"Deep Echelle Spectrophotometry of S 311, a galactic H II Region Outside
  the Solar Circle","We present echelle spectrophotometry of the Galactic H II region S 311. The
data have been taken with the Very Large Telescope UVES echelle spectrograph in
the 3100 to 10400 angstroms range. We have measured the intensities of 263
emission lines, 178 are permitted lines of H0, D0 (deuterium), He0, C0, C+, N0,
N+, O0, O+, S+, Si0, Si+, Ar0 and Fe0; some of them are produced by
recombination and others mainly by fluorescence. Physical conditions have been
derived using different continuum and line intensity ratios. We have derived
He+, C++ and O++ ionic abundances from pure recombination lines as well as
abundances from collisionally excited lines for a large number of ions of
different elements. We have obtained consistent estimations of t2 applying
different methods. We have found that the temperature fluctuations paradigm is
consistent with the t2(He I) vs. t2(H I) relation for H II regions, in contrast
with what has been found for planetary nebulae. We report the detection of
deuterium Balmer lines up to D6 in the blue wings of the hydrogen lines, which
excitation mechanism seems to be continuum fluorescence.",2005-06-17T12:52:59Z
Rotation and anisotropy of galaxies revisited,"The use of the tensor virial theorem (TVT) as a diagnostic of anisotropic
velocity distributions in galaxies is revisited. The TVT provides a rigorous
global link between velocity anisotropy, rotation and shape, but the quantities
appearing in it are not easily estimated observationally. Traditionally use has
been made of a centrally averaged velocity dispersion and the peak rotation
velocity. Although this procedure cannot be rigorously justified, tests on
model galaxies show that it works surprisingly well. With the advent of
integral-field spectroscopy it is now possible to establish a rigorous
connection between the TVT and observations. The TVT is reformulated in terms
of sky-averages, and the new formulation is tested on model galaxies.",2005-04-18T13:22:16Z
"A concise reference to (projected) Sersic R^{1/n} quantities, including
  Concentration, Profile Slopes, Petrosian indices, and Kron Magnitudes","Given the growing use of Sersic's (1963, 1968) R^{1/n} model for describing
the stellar distributions in galaxies, and the lack of any single reference
that provides the various associated mathematical expressions, we have
endeavoured to compile such a resource here. We present the standard intensity
profile, and its various guises such as the luminosity, surface-brightness, and
aperture-magnitude profile. Expressions to transform the effective surface
brightness into the mean effective and central surface brightness are also
given, as is the expression to transform between effective radii and
exponential scale-lengths. We additionally provide expressions for deriving the
`concentration' of an R^{1/n} profile, and two useful equations for the
logarithmic slope of the light-profile are given. Petrosian radii and fluxes
are also derived for a range of Sersic profiles and compared with the effective
radii and total flux. Similarly, expressions to obtain Kron radii and fluxes
are presented as a function of the Sersic index n and the number of effective
radii sampled. Illustrative figures are provided throughout. Finally, the
core-Sersic model, consisting of an inner power-law and an outer-Sersic
function, is presented.",2005-03-08T10:14:42Z
"Mid-infrared spectroscopy of two luminous submillimeter galaxies at
  z~2.8","Using the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on board the Spitzer Space Telescope,
we have obtained rest frame mid-infrared spectroscopy of two bright
submillimeter galaxies. SMMJ02399-0136 at z=2.81 shows a superposition of PAH
emission features and a mid-infrared continuum, indicating significant and
roughly equal contributions to its bolometric luminosity from star formation
and from a Compton-thick AGN. We derive a new redshift of z=2.80 for
MMJ154127+6616 from the IRS spectrum and find this object is dominated by
starburst PAH emission. The rest frame mid- to far-infrared spectral energy
distributions are consistent with these submillimeter galaxies being scaled up
versions of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies. The mid-infrared spectra
support the scenario that submillimeter galaxies are sites of extreme star
formation and represent a key phase in the formation of massive galaxies.",2005-04-20T07:47:01Z
"Self-consistent radiative effect on relativistic electromagnetic
  particle acceleration","We study the radiation damping effect on the relativistic acceleration of
electron-positron plasmas with two-and-half-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC)
simulation. Particles are accelerated by Poynting flux via the diamagnetic
relativistic pulse accelerator (DRPA), and decelerated by the self-consistently
solved radiation damping force. With $\Omega_{ce}/\omega_{pe}\geq 10$, the
Lorentz factor of the highest energy particles reaches gamma>100, and the
acceleration still continues. The emitted radiation is peaked within few
degrees from the direction of Poynting flux and strongly linearly polarized,
which may be detectable in gamma-ray burst(GRB) observations. We also show that
the DRPA is insensitive to the initial supporting currents.",2005-04-27T19:30:21Z
O/H in the Local Bubble,"We present new measurements of the oxygen gas-phase abundance along four
sightlines probing gas inside the Local Bubble, using data obtained with the
Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) and the Hubble Space Telecope
(HST). Combining these with seven previously published N(O I) and N(H I)
measurements we determine a mean O/H ratio for the Local Bubble, (O/H) = (3.45
+/- 0.19)x10^(-4) (1 sigma in the mean). Our result is virtually identical to
O/H = (3.43 +/- 0.15)x10^(-4) derived from data for sightlines probing gas well
outside the Local Bubble. In contrast to the D/O and D/H ratios, which seem to
have different values beyond the Local Bubble, our results show that the O/H
ratio is constant and single-valued both inside and outside the Local Bubble,
for low density sightlines, with column densities up to log N (H) ~ 21. In
addition, the similarity of the two values above suggests that the net effect
of the uncertain O I f-values in the FUSE bandpass is not significant. Taking
into account the latest determinations of the Solar abundance of oxygen, our
result implies that ~25% of the oxygen in the Local Bubble is depleted onto
dust grains. The similarity of the value for O/H along low average density
sightlines in the Local Bubble with that of denser sightlines beyond may permit
a limit on the diluting effects of infalling low metallicity gas.",2005-02-15T15:05:34Z
"Anti-correlated hard X-ray time lag in GRS 1915+105: evidence for a
  truncated accretion disc","Multi-wavelength observations of Galactic black hole candidate sources
indicate a close connection between the accretion disk emission and the jet
emission. The recent discovery of an anti-correlated time lag between the soft
and hard X-rays in Cygnus X-3 (Choudhury & Rao 2004) constrains the geometric
picture of the disk-jet connection into a truncated accretion disk, the
truncation radius being quite close to the black hole. Here we report the
detection of similar anti-correlated time lag in the superluminal jet source
GRS 1915+105. We show the existence of the pivoting in the X-ray spectrum
during the delayed anti-correlation and we also find that the QPO parameters
change along with the spectral pivoting. We explore theoretical models to
understand this phenomenon.",2005-06-14T20:26:30Z
"Radial velocity-acceleration curve analysis of the spectroscopic binary

obtained. The orbital parameters are estimated by the nonlinear least squares
of the radial velocity-acceleration curves. This method is implemented for the
three double line spectroscopic binary systems RZ CAS, CC Cas and V1130 Tau.

"A large spin-up rate measured with INTEGRAL in the High Mass X-ray
  Binary Pulsar SAXJ2103.5+4545","The High Mass X-ray Binary Pulsar SAXJ2103.5+4545 has been observed with
INTEGRAL several times during the last outburst in 2002-2004. We report a
comprehensive study of all INTEGRAL observations, allowing a study of the pulse
period evolution during the recent outburst. We measured a very rapid spin-up
episode, lasting 130days, which decreased the pulse period by 1.8s. The spin-up
rate, pdot=-1.5e-7 s/s, is the largest ever measured for SAXJ2103.5+4545, and
it is among the fastest for an accreting pulsar. The pulse profile shows
evidence for temporal variability, apparently not related to the source flux or
to the orbital phase. The X-ray spectrum is hard and there is significant
emission up to 150keV. A new derivation of the orbital period, based on RXTE
data, is also reported.",2005-05-26T11:18:20Z
"Self-Calibration of Cluster Dark Energy Studies: Observable-Mass
  Distribution","The exponential sensitivity of cluster number counts to the properties of the
dark energy implies a comparable sensitivity to not only the mean but also the
actual_distribution_ of an observable mass proxy given the true cluster mass.
For example a 25% scatter in mass can provide a ~50% change in the number
counts at z~2 for the upcoming SPT survey. Uncertainty in the scatter of this
amount would degrade dark energy constraints to uninteresting levels. Given the
shape of the actual mass function, the properties of the distribution may be
internally monitored by the shape of the_observable_ mass function. An
arbitrary evolution of the scatter of a mass-independent Gaussian distribution
may be self-calibrated to allow a measurement of the dark energy equation of
state of Delta w ~0.1. External constraints on the mass_variance_ of the
distribution that are more accurate than Delta var < 0.01 at z~1 can further
improve constraints by up to a factor of 2. More generally, cluster counts and
their sample variance measured as a function of the observable provide internal
consistency checks on the assumed form of the observable-mass distribution that
will protect against misinterpretation of the dark energy constraints.",2005-03-16T18:27:52Z
"CMB observations from the CBI and VSA: A comparison of coincident maps
  and parameter estimation methods","We present coincident observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
from the Very Small Array (VSA) and Cosmic Background Imager (CBI) telescopes.
The consistency of the full datasets is tested in the map plane and the Fourier
plane, prior to the usual compression of CMB data into flat bandpowers. Of the
three mosaics observed by each group, two are found to be in excellent
agreement. In the third mosaic, there is a 2 sigma discrepancy between the
correlation of the data and the level expected from Monte Carlo simulations.
This is shown to be consistent with increased phase calibration errors on VSA
data during summer observations. We also consider the parameter estimation
method of each group. The key difference is the use of the variance window
function in place of the bandpower window function, an approximation used by
the VSA group. A re-evaluation of the VSA parameter estimates, using bandpower
windows, shows that the two methods yield consistent results.",2005-02-16T22:40:26Z

"On the Estimation of Solar Energetic Particle Injection Timing from
  Onset Times near Earth","We examine the accuracy of a common technique for estimating the start time
of solar energetic particle injection based on a linear fit to the observed
onset time versus 1/(particle velocity). This is based on a concept that the
first arriving particles move directly along the magnetic field with no
scattering. We check this by performing numerical simulations of the transport
of solar protons between 2 and 2000 MeV from the Sun to the Earth, for several
assumptions regarding interplanetary scattering and the duration of particle
injection, and analyzing the results using the inverse velocity fit. We find
that in most cases, the onset times align close to a straight line as a
function of inverse velocity. Despite this, the estimated injection time can be
in error by several minutes. Also, the estimated path length can deviate
greatly from the actual path length along the interplanetary magnetic field.
The major difference between the estimated and actual path lengths implies that
the first arriving particles cannot be viewed as moving directly along the

  and evolution of the galaxy population","The K20 survey is a near infrared-selected, deep (Ks < 20) redshift survey
targeting galaxies in two independent regions of the sky, the CDFS and the
q0055-2659 field. The total Ks-selected sample includes 545 objects. Optical
spectra for 525 of them have been obtained, providing 501 spectroscopic
identifications (including 12 type-1 AGN and 45 stars). This paper describes
the final K20 spectroscopic catalogue, along with the technique used to
determine redshifts, measure the spectral features and characterize the
spectra. The classification of the galaxy spectra has been performed according
to a simple parametric recipe that uses the equivalent widths of the two main
emission lines (O[II] and Halpha+[N II]) and two continuum indices (the 4000A
break index, and a near-UV color index, C(28-39)). We defined three main
spectroscopic classes: red early-type galaxies, blue emission-line galaxies and
the intermediate galaxies, which show emission lines but a red continuum. More
than 95% of the examined galaxies is included in one of these spectral types
and a composite spectrum is built for each of the three galaxy classes. The
blue emission-line and the early-type galaxies have been divided in redshift
bins, and the corresponding composite spectra have been built, in order to
investigate the evolution of the spectral properties of the K20 galaxies with
redshift.",2005-04-11T16:35:48Z
The X-ray Ridge Surrounding Sgr A* at the Galactic Center,"We present the first detailed simulation of the interaction between the
supernova explosion that produced Sgr A East and the wind-swept inner ~ 2-pc
region at the Galactic center. The passage of the supernova ejecta through this
medium produces an X-ray ridge ~ 9'' to 15'' to the NE of the supermassive
black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). We show that the morphology and X-ray
intensity of this feature match very well with recently obtained Chandra
images, and we infer a supernova remnant age of less than 2,000 years. This
young age--a factor 3--4 lower than previous estimates--arises from our
inclusion of stellar wind effects in the initial (pre-explosion) conditions in
the medium. The supernova does not clear out the central ~ 0.2-pc region around
Sgr~A* and does not significantly alter the accretion rate onto the central
black hole upon passage through the Galactic center.",2005-06-10T19:33:16Z
Non-LTE Spectra of Accretion Disks Around Intermediate-Mass Black Holes,"We have calculated the structures and the emergent spectra of stationary,
geometrically thin accretion disks around 100 and 1000 M_sun black holes in
both the Schwarzschild and extreme Kerr metrics. Equations of radiative
transfer, hydrostatic equilibrium, energy balance, ionization equilibrium, and
statistical equilibrium are solved simultaneously and consistently. The six
most astrophysically abundant elements (H, He, C, N, O, and Fe) are included,
as well as energy transfer by Comptonization. The observed spectrum as a
function of viewing angle is computed incorporating all general relativistic
effects. We find that, in contrast with the predictions of the commonly-used
multi-color disk (MCD) model, opacity associated with photoionization of heavy
elements can significantly alter the spectrum near its peak. These ionization
edges can create spectral breaks visible in the spectra of slowly-spinning
black holes viewed from almost all angles and in the spectra of
rapidly-spinning black holes seen approximately pole-on. For fixed mass and
accretion rate relative to Eddington, both the black hole spin and the viewing
angle can significantly shift the observed peak energy of the spectrum,
particularly for rapid spin viewed obliquely or edge-on. We present a detailed
test of the approximations made in various forms of the MCD model. Linear
limb-darkening is confirmed to be a reasonable approximation for the integrated
flux, but not for many specific frequencies of interest.",2005-02-17T16:45:06Z
"Discovery of > 200 RR Lyrae Variables in M62: An Oosterhoff I Globular
  Cluster with a Predominantly Blue HB","We report on the discovery of a large number of RR Lyrae variable stars in
the moderately metal-rich Galactic globular cluster M62 (NGC 6266), which
places it among the top three most RR Lyrae-rich globular clusters known.
Likely members of the cluster in our studied field, from our preliminary number
counts, include about 130 fundamental-mode (RRab) pulsators, with <P(ab)> =
0.548 d, and about 75 first-overtone (RRc) pulsators, with <P(c)> = 0.300 d.
The average periods and the position of the RRab variables with well-defined
light curves in the Bailey diagram both suggest that the cluster is of
Oosterhoff type I. However, the morphology of the cluster's horizontal branch
(HB) is strikingly similar to that of the Oosterhoff type II globular cluster
M15 (NGC 7078), with a dominant blue HB component and a very extended blue
tail. Since M15 and M62 differ in metallicity by about one dex, we conclude
that metallicity, at a fixed HB type, is a key parameter determining the
Oosterhoff status of a globular cluster and the position of its variables in
the Bailey diagram.",2005-03-11T15:03:58Z
"The Growth, Polarization, and Motion of the Radio Afterglow from the
  Giant Flare from SGR 1806-20","The extraordinary giant flare (GF) of 2004 December 27 from the soft gamma
repeater (SGR) 1806-20 was followed by a bright radio afterglow. We present an
analysis of VLA observations of this radio afterglow from SGR 1806-20,
consisting of previously reported 8.5 GHz data covering days 7 to 20 after the
GF, plus new observations at 8.5 and 22 GHz from day 24 to 81. We detect motion
in the flux centroid of the afterglow, at an average velocity of 0.26 +/- 0.03
c (assuming a distance of 15 kpc) at a position angle of -45 degrees. This
motion, in combination with the growth and polarization measurements, suggests
an asymmetric outflow, mainly from one side of the magnetar. We find a
deceleration in the expansion, from ~9 mas/day to <5 mas/day. The time of
deceleration is roughly coincident with the rebrightening in the radio light
curve, as expected to result when the ejecta from the GF sweeps up enough of
the external medium, and transitions from a coasting phase to the Sedov-Taylor
regime. The radio afterglow is elongated and maintains a 2:1 axis ratio with an
average position angle of -40 degrees (north through east), oriented
perpendicular to the average intrinsic linear polarization angle.",2005-04-16T14:43:26Z
"Radio astronomical probes of cosmic reionization and the first luminous
  sources: probing the 'twilight zone'","The epoch of reionization (EoR) corresponds to a 'cosmic phase transition',
when the neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) becomes ionized by the first stars
and/or AGN. While the discoveries of Gunn-Peterson (GP) absorption troughs in
the spectra of the highest redshift QSOs, and large scale polarization of the
CMB, have set the first hard constraints on the EoR, the redshift and process
of reionization, and the nature of the first luminous objects, remain two of
the paramount questions in cosmic structure formation. Moreover, the GP effect
is such that observations of objects during this epoch will be difficult at
wavelengths shorter than about 1 micron. Hence, cosmic reionization, and the
formation of the first luminous objects, occurs in a 'twilight zone',
observable only at radio through near-IR wavelengths. In this talk I explore
studies of the EoR at meter through submillimeter wavelengths. I present recent
observations of the dust, molecular gas, and star formation activity in the
host galaxies of the highest redshift QSOs. These results have interesting
implications on the timescale for metal and dust enrichment, on the possibility
of co-eval formation of SMBHs and galaxies, and on the process of reionization.
I then discuss future capabilities of low frequency radio astronomy to study
the neutral IGM via the HI 21cm line, including imaging and power spectral
analyses of large scale structure in emission, and absorption studies toward
the first radio loud sources. I conclude with a summary of the VLA-VHF system
to study cosmic Stromgren spheres associated with the highest redshift SDSS
QSOs in the HI 21cm line at 190 MHz.",2005-02-17T19:34:37Z
Binary star formation from ring fragmentation,"We present a simple model of binary star formation based on the assumption
that rotating prestellar cores collapse to form rings and these rings then
fragment into protostars. We assume that each ring spawns a small number (N <=
6) of protostars, and that the condensation of the protostars is sufficiently
rapid that they can subsequently be treated as point masses. We simulate the
dynamical evolution of a ring of N stars and record the properties of the
single stars, binaries and higher multiples that form as a result of the
dissolution of the ring. The masses of the individual stars in a ring are drawn
from a log-normal distribution with dispersion \sigma. This part of the model
is perfomed for many different realizations of the ring, to obtain good
statistics. The second part of the model is to convolve the results of these
dimensionless simulations, first with the distribution of core masses, which
yields the distributions of multiplicity,mass ratio and eccentricity, as a
function of primary mass; and second with the distribution of core angular
momenta, which yields the distributions of semi-major axis and period, again as
a function of primary mass. Using the observed distribution of core masses, and
the observed distribution of core angular momenta, our model is able to
reproduce the observed IMF, the observed high multiplicity frequency of
pre-Main Sequence stars, the observed distribution of separations, and -- for
long-period systems -- the observed distributions of eccentricity and
mass-ratio, provided we invoke N = 4 or 5 and $\sigma = 0.6$. We presume that
the reduced multiplicity frequency in the field, compared with young clusters,
is the result of dynamical interactions between stars formed in different cores
but the same cluster, following ring dissolution.",2005-03-18T12:39:54Z
"The Binarity of Eta Carinae Revealed from Photoionization Modeling of
  the Spectral Variability of the Weigelt Blobs B and D","We focus on two Hubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph
(HST/STIS) spectra of the Weigelt Blobs B&D, extending from 1640 to 10400A; one
recorded during the 1998 minimum (March 1998) and the other recorded in
February 1999, early in the following broad maximum. The spatially-resolved
spectra suggest two distinct ionization regions. One structure is the
permanently low ionization cores of the Weigelt Blobs, B&D, located several
hundred AU from the ionizing source. Their spectra are dominated by emission
from H I, [N II], Fe II, [Fe II], Ni II, [Ni II], Cr II and Ti II. The second
region, relatively diffuse in character and located between the ionizing source
and the Weigelt Blobs, is more highly ionized with emission from [FeIII], [Fe
IV], N III], [Ne III], [Ar III], [Si III], [S III] and He I. Through
photoionization modeling, we find that the radiation field from the more
massive B-star companion supports the low ionization structure throughout the
5.54 year period. The radiation field of an evolved O-star is required to
produce the higher ionization emission seen across the broad maximum. This
emission region is identified with slow-moving condensations photoionized by
the O star and located in the extended mass flow emanating from the B star
primary. Comparison between the models and observations reveals that the high
ionization region is physically distinct (n_H ~ 10^7 cm^(-3) and T_e ~ 10^4K)
from the BD Blobs (n_H ~ 10^6 cm^(-3), T_e ~ 7000K).",2005-02-04T16:31:38Z
SDSS J1553+0056: A BALQSO mimicking a Lyman-break galaxy,"Using the UVES echelle spectrograph at the ESO VLT we obtained
high-resolution (R = 40 000) spectra of the object SDSS J1553+0056, which has
been identified in the literature alternatively as a high-redshift quasar or as
a Lyman-break galaxy (LBG). Although low-resolution spectra of SDSS J1553+0056
closely resemble those of LBGs, our high-resolution spectra allow us to
identify this object unambiguously as a LoBAL quasar, probably belonging to the
rare FeLoBALQSO class. Based on our spectrum we discuss how misidentifications
of such objects from low-resolution spectra can be avoided.",2005-02-10T10:05:46Z
Combined and Comparative Analysis of Power Spectra,"In solar physics, especially in exploratory stages of research, it is often
necessary to compare the power spectra of two or more time series. One may, for
instance, wish to estimate what the power spectrum of the combined data sets
might have been, or one may wish to estimate the significance of a particular
peak that shows up in two or more power spectra. One may also on occasion need
to search for a complex of peaks in a single power spectrum, such as a
fundamental and one or more harmonics, or a fundamental plus sidebands, etc.
Visual inspection can be revealing, but it can also be misleading. This leads
one to look for one or more ways of forming statistics, which readily lend
themselves to significance estimation, from two or more power spectra. We
derive formulas for statistics formed from the sum, the minimum, and the
product of two or more power spectra. A distinguishing feature of our formulae
is that, if each power spectrum has an exponential distribution, each statistic
also has an exponential distribution.",2005-02-02T20:58:31Z
The mass of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and the missing satellite problem,"We present the results from a suite of N-body simulations of the tidal
stripping of two-component dwarf galaxies comprising some stars and dark
matter. We show that recent kinematic data from the local group dwarf
spheroidal (dSph) galaxies suggests that dSph galaxies must be sufficiently
massive ($10^9 - 10^{10}$M$_\odot$) that tidal stripping is of little
importance for the stars. We discuss the implications of these massive dSph
galaxies for cosmology and galaxy formation.",2005-05-11T10:55:30Z
"X-Ray Observations of the Black Hole Transient 4U 1630-47 During Two
  Years of X-Ray Activity","The black hole candidate (BHC) X-ray transient 4U 1630-47 continuously
produced strong X-ray emission for over 2 years during 2002-2004. We use
observations made with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) to study the
source throughout the outburst along with hard X-ray images from the
INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL). The source exhibits
extreme behaviors, including measured inner disk temperatures (Tin) between 2.7
and 3.8 keV, which are only rivaled by the brightest BHC systems. If the high
temperatures are caused by the dominance of electron scattering opacity in the
inner regions of the accretion disk, a luminosity >20% of the Eddington limit
is theoretically required. We detect several types of variability, including
hard 10-100 s flares at the highest disk luminosities in a regime where the
source deviates from the Ldisk/Tin relationship that is seen at lower
luminosities, possibly suggesting that we are seeing transitions between a
standard disk and a ""slim"" disk. The X-ray properties in 2002-2004 are
significantly different from those seen during the 1998 outburst, which is the
only outburst with detected radio jet emission. Our results support the
""jet-line"" concept recently advanced by Fender and co-workers. Our study allows
for a test of the quantitative McClintock & Remillard spectral state
definitions. We also report on detections of the nearby sources IGR J16320-4751
and IGR J16358-4726.",2005-05-12T22:12:15Z
X-ray line tomography of AGN-induced motion in clusters of galaxies,"The thermal broadening of emission lines of heavy ions is small enough such
that Doppler shifts due to bulk motions may be detected with the next
generation of X-ray observatories. This opens up the possibility to study gas
velocities in the intra-cluster medium. Here we study the effect of bulk
motions induced by a central active galactic nucleus (AGN) on the emission
lines around the FeXXV complex. We have modelled the evolution of AGN-induced
bubbles in a realistic cosmological framework and studied the resulting FeXXV
line profiles. We found that in clusters with AGN feedback, motions induced by
the inflation of bubbles and their buoyant rise lead to distinct features in
the iron emission lines that are detectable with a spectral resolution of about
10 eV. These observations will help to determine the mechanical energy that
resides in the bubbles and thereby the kinetic luminosity of the AGN.",2005-03-30T13:16:34Z
A Physical Model for the joint evolution of high-z QSOs and Spheroids,"We summarize our physical model for the early co-evolution of spheroidal
galaxies and of active nuclei at their centers. Our predictions are in
excellent agreement with a number of observables which proved to be extremely
challenging for all the current semi-analytic models, including the sub-mm
counts and the corresponding redshift distributions, and the epoch-dependent
K-band luminosity function of spheroidal galaxies. Also, the black hole mass
function and the relationship between the black hole mass and the velocity
dispersion in the galaxy are nicely reproduced. The mild AGN activity revealed
by X-ray observations of SCUBA sources is in keeping with our scenario, and
testify the build up of SMBH triggered by intense star formation.",2005-04-21T16:19:54Z
Cosmological mass functions and moving barrier models,"In the ellipsoidal collapse model, the critical density for the collapse of a
gravitationally bound object is a function of its mass. In the excursion set
formalism, this translates into a moving barrier problem such that the mass
function of dark matter haloes is given by the first crossing probability of a
random walker across the barrier. In this paper, we study this first crossing
probability analytically. Complete solutions are obtained for barriers that
vary as square root of time and square of time. Large and small time asymptotic
behaviour is derived. For arbitrary power-law barriers, the large time
behaviour is determined. The solutions allow us to derive useful inferences
about the scaling of the conditional mass function in terms of present day halo
masses and look back redshifts. As an application of our results, we compare
the estimates of major merger rates of haloes in constant and moving barrier
models and find that for massive haloes ($10^{12-13} M_\odot$) the latter
predicts significantly higher merger rates towards high redshifts ($z \gtrsim
4$)",2005-02-24T18:14:31Z
"Feedback from quasars in star-forming galaxies and the triggering of
  massive galactic winds","The shining of quasars is a likely trigger of massive galatic winds, able to
remove most ISM from a star-forming spheroid. However, the mechanism
responsible for the deposition of energy into the ISM is still unclear.
Starting from a model for feedback in galaxy formation with a two-phase medium
(Monaco 2004a), we propose that the perturbation induced by radiative heating
from a quasar on the ISM triggers a critical change of feedback regime. In the
feedback model, SNRs expanding in the hot and pressurized phase of a
star-forming spheroid tipically become pressure-confined before the hot
interior gas is able to cool. Whenever the evaporation flow due to radiative
heating of the quasar is significant with respect to the star-formation rate,
the SNRs reach the point where their interior gas cools before being confined,
forming a thick cold shell. We show that in this conditions the shells
percolate into a super-shell of cold gas that sweeps the whole galaxy.
Radiation pressure then pushes the shell out of the galaxy. This self-limiting
mechanism leads to a correlation between black hole and bulge masses. The
insertion of a motivated wind trigger criterion in a hierarchical galaxy
formation model shows however that winds are not necessary to obtain a good
black hole--bulge correlation. In absence of winds, good results are obtained
if the mechanism responsible for the creation of a reservoir of low-angular
momentum gas (able to accrete onto the black hole) deposits mass at a rate
proportional to the star-formation rate. Using a novel galaxy formation model,
we show under which conditions black hole masses are self-limited by the wind
mechanism described above, and outline the possible observational consequences
of this self-limitation. [Abridged]",2005-02-07T17:14:59Z
A New delta N Formalism for Multi-Component Inflation,"The delta N formula that relates the final curvature perturbation on comoving
slices to the inflaton perturbation on flat slices after horizon crossing is a
powerful and intuitive tool to compute the curvature perturbation spectrum from
inflation. However, it is customarily assumed further that the conventional
slow-roll condition is satisfied, and satisfied by all components, during
horizon crossing. In this paper, we develop a new delta N formalism for
multi-component inflation that can be applied in the most general situations.
This allows us to generalize the idea of general slow-roll inflation to the
multi-component case, in particular only applying the general slow-roll
condition to the relevant component. We compute the power spectrum of the
curvature perturbation in multi-component general slow-roll inflation, and find
that under quite general conditions it is invertible.",2005-06-13T05:29:51Z
Optical Constraints on an X-ray Transient Source in M31,"We have detected a transient X-ray source in the M31 bulge through a
continuing monitoring campaign with the Chandra ACIS-I camera. The source was
detected at R.A.=00:42:33.428 +/- 0.11'', Dec.=+41:17:03.37 +/- 0.11'' in only
a single observation taken 2004 May 23. Fortuitous optical HST/ACS imaging of
the transient location prior to the X-ray outburst, along with follow-up
HST/ACS imaging during and after the outburst, reveals no transient optical
source brighter than B (equivalent) = 25.5. The location of the source and its
X-ray properties suggest it is a low mass X-ray binary (LMXB). Assuming the
transient is similar to many Galactic X-ray novae, the X-ray luminosity of (3.9
+/- 0.5) X 10$^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and the upper-limit on the optical luminosity
provide a prediction of <1.6 days for the orbital period of the binary system.",2005-06-14T15:58:33Z
"A Study of Edge-On Galaxies with the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced
  Camera for Surveys. II. Vertical distribution of the resolved stellar
  population","We analyze the vertical distribution of the resolved stellar populations in
six low-mass, edge-on, spiral galaxies observed with the Hubble Space Telescope
Advanced Camera for Surveys. In each galaxy we find evidence for an extraplanar
stellar component extending up to 15 scale heights (3.5 kpc) above the plane.
We analyze the vertical distribution as a function of stellar age by tracking
changes in the color-magnitude diagram. The young stellar component (<10^8 yrs)
is found to have a scale height larger than the young component in the Milky
Way, suggesting that stars in these low mass galaxies form in a thicker disk.
We also find that the scale height of a stellar population increases with age,
with young main sequence stars, intermediate age asymptotic giant branch stars,
and old red giant branch stars having succesively larger scale heights in each
galaxy. This systematic trend indicates that disk heating must play some role
in producing the extraplanar stars. We constrain the rate of disk heating using
the observed trend between scale height and stellar age, and find that the
observed heating rates are dramatically smaller than in the Milky Way. The
color distributions of the red giant branch stars well above the midplane
indicate that the extended stellar components we see are moderately metal-poor,
with peak metallicities around [Fe/H]=-1 and with little or no metallicity
gradient with height. The lack of metallicity gradient can be explained if a
majority of extraplanar RGB stars were formed at early times and are not
dominated by a younger heated population. Our observations suggest that, like
the Milky Way, low-mass disk galaxies also have multiple stellar components. In
its structure, mean metallicity and old age, the RGB component in these
galaxies seems analagous to the Milky Way thick disk. [ABRIDGED]",2005-06-06T17:32:45Z
"Energetics - Spectral correlations vs the BATSE Gamma-Ray Bursts
  population","Recently proposed correlations between the energetics of Gamma-Ray Bursts
(GRB) and their spectral properties, namely the peak energy of their prompt
emission, are found to account for the observed fluence distribution of all
`bright' BATSE GRB. Furthermore for an intrinsic GRB peak energy distribution
extending toward lower energies with respect to that characterizing bright GRB,
such correlations allow to reproduce the fluence distribution of the whole
BATSE long GRB population. We discuss the constraints that such analysis
imposes on the shape of the peak energy distribution, the opening angle
distribution and the tightness of such correlations.",2005-02-09T14:02:47Z
The XMM-LSS survey: The XMDS/VVDS 4 sigma catalogue,"We present a first catalogue of X-ray sources resulting from the central area
of the XMM-LSS (Large Scale Structure survey). We describe the reduction
procedures and the database tools we developed and used to derive a well
defined catalogue of X-ray sources. The present catalogue is limited to a
sub-sample of 286 sources detected at 4 sigma in the 1 deg^2 area covered by
the photometric VVDS (VIRMOS VLT Deep Survey), which allows us to provide
optical and radio identifications. We also discuss the X-ray properties of a
larger X-ray sample of 536 sources detected at > 4 sigma in the full 3 deg^2
area of the XMM Medium Deep Survey (XMDS) independently of the optical
identification. We also derive the logN-logS relationship for a sample of more
than one thousand sources that we discuss in the context of other surveys at
similar fluxes.",2005-05-06T09:37:49Z
Primordial Power Spectrum Reconstruction,"In order to reconstruct the initial conditions of the universe it is
important to devise a method that can efficiently constrain the shape of the
power spectrum of primordial matter density fluctuations in a model-independent
way from data. In an earlier paper we proposed a method based on the wavelet
expansion of the primordial power spectrum. The advantage of this method is
that the orthogonality and multiresolution properties of wavelet basis
functions enable information regarding the shape of $P_{\rm in}(k)$ to be
encoded in a small number of non-zero coefficients. Any deviation from
scale-invariance can then be easily picked out. Here we apply this method to
simulated data to demonstrate that it can accurately reconstruct an input
$P_{\rm in}(k)$, and present a prescription for how this method should be used
on future data.",2005-02-07T15:16:58Z
Diffusive Acceleration of Ions at Interplanetary Shocks,"Heliospheric shocks are excellent systems for testing theories of particle
acceleration in their environs. These generally fall into two classes: (1)
interplanetary shocks that are linear in their ion acceleration
characteristics, with the non-thermal ions serving as test particles, and (2)
non-linear systems such as the Earth's bow shock and the solar wind termination
shock, where the accelerated ions strongly influence the magnetohydrodynamic
structure of the shock. This paper explores the modelling of diffusive
acceleration at a particular interplanetary shock, with an emphasis on
explaining in situ measurements of ion distribution functions. The
observational data for this event was acquired on day 292 of 1991 by the
Ulysses mission. The modeling is performed using a well-known kinetic Monte
Carlo simulation, which has yielded good agreement with observations at several
heliospheric shocks, as have other theoretical techniques, namely hybrid plasma
simulations, and numerical solution of the diffusion-convection equation. In
this theory/data comparison, it is demonstrated that diffusive acceleration
theory can, to first order, successfully account for both the proton
distribution data near the shock, and the observation of energetic protons
farther upstream of this interplanetary shock than lower energy pick-up
protons, using a single turbulence parameter. The principal conclusion is that
diffusive acceleration of inflowing upstream ions can model this pick-up
ion-rich event without the invoking any seed pre-acceleration mechanism, though
this investigation does not rule out the action of such pre-acceleration.",2005-06-08T19:23:59Z
"Accretion by the Secondary in Eta Carinae During the Spectroscopic
  Event: I. Flow Parameters","We examine the influence of the gravity of the companion (the secondary) to
the massive primary star Eta Carinae on the winds blown by the primary and the
secondary. The two winds collide with each other after passing through two
respective shock waves, and escape the system while strongly emitting in the
X-ray band. While during most of the 5.5 years orbital period, the companion's
gravity has a negligible effect on the winds, we find that near periastron, the
companion's gravity may significantly influence the flow and the companion
might accrete from the primary's wind under certain circumstances. Near
periastron passage, the collision region of the two winds may collapse onto the
secondary star, a process that could substantially reduce the X-ray luminosity.
We suggest that such an accretion process produces the long, almost flat, X-ray
minimum in Eta Carinae.",2005-05-11T03:37:47Z
TeV photons and Neutrinos from giant soft-gamma repeaters flares,"During the last 35 years three giant flares were observed from so-called Soft
Gamma Repeaters (SGR's). They are assumed to be associated with star-quakes of
pulsars accelerating electrons and, possibly, protons to high energy in the
huge magnetic fields as inferred from the observations. Because of this and the
observation of non-thermal emission it has been speculated that they may be
cosmic ray accelerators producing gamma-rays up to TeV energies. Neutrino
telescopes, such as AMANDA and the ANTARES now under construction, could be
used as TeV-gamma detectors for very short emissions by measuring underground
muons produced in $\gamma$ showers. We estimate signal and background rates for
TeV photons from SGR giant flares in AMANDA, and we provide an estimate of the
gamma shower events that Milagro could detect.
  Moreover, we consider that, if hadrons are accelerated in these sources, high
energy neutrinos would be produced together with photons. These may be detected
in neutrino telescopes using neutrino-induced cascades and upgoing muons.
  We argue that the Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array AMANDA may have
observed the December 27, 2004 giant flare from the soft gamma-ray repeater SGR
1806-20 if the non-thermal component of the spectrum extends to TeV energies
(at present the actual data is subject to blind analysis). Rates should be
scaled by about two orders of magnitude in km3 detectors, such as IceCube,
making SGR flares sources of primary interest.",2005-03-16T15:53:24Z
Revealing the Supernova Remnant Population of M33 with Chandra,"We present results of a search for supernova remnants (SNRs) in archival
Chandra images of M33. We have identified X-ray SNRs by comparing the list of
Chandra, X-ray sources in M33 with tabulations of SNR candidates identified
from (1) elevated [S II]/Halpha ratios in the optical, and (2) radio spectral
indices. Of the 98 optically known SNRs in M33, 22 have been detected at >
3-sigma level in the soft band (0.35-1.1 keV). At least four of these SNR
candidates are spatially extended based on a comparison of the data to
simulated images of point sources. Aside from the optically matching SNRs, we
have found one soft X-ray source in M33 which exhibits no optical emission and
is coincident with a known radio source. The radio spectral index of this
source is consistent with particle acceleration in shocks, leading us to
suggest that it is a non-radiative SNR. We have also found new optical
counterparts to two soft X-ray SNRs in M33. Pending confirmation from optical
spectroscopy, the identification of these two optical counterparts increases
the total number of known optically emitting SNRs in M33 to 100. This brings
the total number of identified SNRs with X-ray counterparts, including those
exclusively detected by the XMM-Newton survey of M33, to 37 SNRs. We find that
while there are a similar number of confirmed X-ray SNRs in M33 and the LMC
with X-ray luminosities in excess of 1e35 ergs/s, nearly 40% of the LMC SNRs
are brighter than 1e36 ergs/s, while only 13% of the M33 sample exceed this
luminosity. The differences in luminosity distributions cannot be fully
explained by uncertainty in spectral model parameters, and is not fully
accounted for by abundance differences between the galaxies (abridged).",2005-04-26T23:13:13Z
Spectroscopic metallicities for planet-host stars: extending the samples,"We present stellar parameters and metallicities for 29 planet-host stars, as
well as for a large volume-limited sample of 53 stars not known to be orbited
by any planetary-mass companion. These stars add to the results presented in
our previous series of papers, providing two large and uniform samples of 119
planet-hosts and 94 ``single'' stars with accurate stellar parameters and
[Fe/H] estimates. The analysis of the results further confirms that stars with
planets are metal-rich when compared with average field dwarfs. Important
biases that may compromise future studies are also discussed. Finally, we
compare the metallicity distributions for single planet-hosts and planet-hosts
in multiple stellar systems. The results show that a small difference cannot be
excluded, in the sense that the latter sample is slighly overmetallic. However,
more data are needed to confirm this correlation.",2005-04-06T18:21:04Z
"Chandra Observation of an X-ray Flare at Saturn: Evidence for Direct
  Solar Control on Saturn's Disk X-ray Emissions","Saturn was observed by Chandra ACIS-S on 20 and 26-27 January 2004 for one
full Saturn rotation (10.7 hr) at each epoch. We report here the first
observation of an X-ray flare from Saturn's non-auroral (low-latitude) disk,
which is seen in direct response to an M6-class flare emanating from a sunspot
that was clearly visible from both Saturn and Earth. Saturn's disk X-ray
emissions are found to be variable on time scales of hours to weeks to months,
and correlated with solar F10.7 cm flux. Unlike Jupiter, X-rays from Saturn's
polar (auroral) region have characteristics similar to those from its disk.
This report, combined with earlier studies, establishes that disk X-ray
emissions of the giant planets Saturn and Jupiter are directly regulated by
processes happening on the Sun. We suggest that these emissions could be
monitored to study X-ray flaring from solar active regions when they are on the
far side and not visible to Near-Earth space weather satellites.",2005-04-05T14:33:34Z
"Quiescent Radio Emission from Southern Late-type M Dwarfs and a
  Spectacular Radio Flare from the M8 Dwarf DENIS 1048-3956","We report the results of a radio monitoring program conducted at the
Australia Telescope Compact Array to search for quiescent and flaring emission
from seven nearby Southern late-type M and L dwarfs. Two late-type M dwarfs,
the M7 V LHS 3003 and the M8 V DENIS 1048-3956, were detected in quiescent
emission at 4.80 GHz. The observed emission is consistent with optically thin
gyrosynchrotron emission from mildly relativistic (~1-10 keV) electrons with
source densities n_e <~ 10^9 cm^-3 in B >~ 10 G magnetic fields. DENIS
1048-3956 was also detected in two spectacular, short-lived flares, one at 4.80
GHz (peak f_nu = 6.0+/-0.8 mJy) and one at 8.64 GHz (peak f_nu = 29.6+/-1.0
mJy) approximately 10 minutes later. The high brightness temperature (T_B >~
10^13 K), short emission period (~4-5 minutes), high circular polarization
(~100%), and apparently narrow spectral bandwidth of these events imply a
coherent emission process in a region of high electron density (n_e ~
10^11-10^12 cm^-3) and magnetic field strength (B ~ 1 kG). If the two flare
events are related, the apparent frequency drift in the emission suggests that
the emitting source either moved into regions of higher electron or magnetic
flux density; or was compressed, e.g., by twisting field lines or gas motions.
The quiescent fluxes from the radio-emitting M dwarfs violate the Gudel-Benz
empirical radio/X-ray relations, confirming a trend previously noted by Berger
et al. (abridged)",2005-02-17T23:16:17Z
"Detection of TeV gamma-ray Emission from the Shell-Type Supernova
  Remnant RX J0852.0-4622 with H.E.S.S","We report the detection of TeV gamma-rays from the shell-type supernova
remnant RX J0852.0-4622 with data of 3.2 h of live time recorded with H.E.S.S.
in February 2004. An excess of (700 +/- 60) events from the whole remnant with
a significance of 12 sigma was found. The observed emission region is clearly
extended with a radius of the order of 1 degree and the spatial distribution of
the signal correlates with X-ray observations. The spectrum in the energy range
between 500 GeV and 15 TeV is well described by a power law with a photon index
of 2.1 +/- 0.1(stat) +/- 0.2(syst) and a differential flux at 1 TeV of (2.1 +/-
0.2(stat) +/- 0.6(syst)) 10^{-11} cm^{-2} s^{-1} TeV^{-1}. The integral flux
above 1 TeV was measured to be (1.9 +/- 0.3(stat) +/- 0.6(syst)) 10^{-11}
cm^{-2} s^{-1}, which is at the level of the flux of the Crab nebula at these
energies. More data are needed to draw firm conclusions on the magnetic field
in the remnant and the type of the particle population creating the TeV
gamma-rays.",2005-05-18T14:15:25Z
Jets Driven by Accretion Onto Spinning Black Holes,"We present a theoretical model for driving jets by accretion onto Kerr black
holes and try to give an answer to the following question: How much energy
could be extracted from a rotating black hole and its accretion disk in order
to power relativistic jets in Active Galactic Nuclei?",2005-05-19T12:01:38Z
Cosmological Constraints on Newton's Constant,"We present cosmological constraints on deviations of Newton's constant at
large scales, analyzing latest cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies
and primordial abundances of light elements synthesized by big bang
nucleosynthesis (BBN). BBN limits the possible deviation at typical scales of
BBN epoch, say at 10^8 \sim 10^12m, to lie between -5% and +1% of the
experimental value, and CMB restricts the deviation at larger scales 10^2 \sim
10^9pc to be between -26% and +66% at the 2\sigma confidence level. The
cosmological constraints are compared with the astronomical one from the
evolution of isochrone of globular clusters.",2005-03-27T03:33:54Z
"Photoevaporation Flows in Blister HII Regions: I. Smooth Ionization
  Fronts and Application to the Orion Nebula","We present hydrodynamical simulations of the photoevaporation of a cloud with
large-scale density gradients, giving rise to an ionized, photoevaporation
flow. The flow is found to be approximately steady during the large part of its
evolution, during which it can resemble a ""champagne flow"" or a ""globule flow""
depending on the curvature of the ionization front. The distance from source to
ionization front and the front curvature uniquely determine the structure of
the flow, with the curvature depending on the steepness of the lateral density
gradient in the neutral cloud. We compare these simulations with both new and
existing observations of the Orion nebula and find that a model with a mildly
convex ionization front can reproduce the profiles of emission measure,
electron density, and mean line velocity for a variety of emitting ions on
scales of 10^{17} to 10^{18} cm. The principal failure of our model is that we
cannot explain the large observed widths of the [O I] 6300 Angstrom line that
forms at the ionization front.",2005-04-09T04:03:30Z
"The Non-Monotonic Dependence of Supernova and Remnant Formation on
  Progenitor Rotation","Traditional models of core collapse suggest the issue of successful versus
failed supernova explosions and neutron star versus black hole formation
depends monotonically on the mass (and metallicity) of the progenitor star.
Here we argue that the issue of success or failure of the explosion or other
possible outcomes may depend non--monotonically on the rotation of the
progenitor star even at fixed progenitor mass and composition. We have computed
""shellular"" models of core collapse for a star of 15 M_solar with initial
central angular velocity, Omega_0, in the range 0.1 -- 8 rad/s until a few
hundred ms after bounce to explore qualitative trends. The non--monotonic
behavior will be manifested in the rotation of the proto--neutron star and
hence in the strength of the associated magnetic field that will be generated
by shear in that rotating environment. We estimate that our maximally rotating
and shearing models generate toroidal fields approaching or exceeding 10^17G,
strengths nearing dynamical significance.",2005-04-26T00:07:15Z
"Dynamical evolution of neutrino--cooled accretion disks: detailed
  microphysics, lepton-driven convection, and global energetics","We present a detailed, two dimensional numerical study of the microphysical
conditions and dynamical evolution of accretion disks around black holes when
neutrino emission is the main source of cooling. Such structures are likely to
form after the gravitational collapse of massive rotating stellar cores, or the
coalescence of two compact objects in a binary (e.g., the Hulse--Taylor
system). The physical composition is determined self consistently by
considering two regimes: neutrino--opaque and neutrino--transparent, with a
detailed equation of state which takes into account neutronization, nuclear
statistical equilibrium of a gas of free nucleons and alpha particles,
blackbody radiation and a relativistic Fermi gas of arbitrary degeneracy.
Various neutrino emission processes are considered, with electron/positron
capture onto free nucleons providing the dominant contribution to the cooling
rate. We find that important temporal and spatial scales, related to the
optically thin/optically thick transition are present in the disk, and manifest
themselves clearly in the energy output in neutrinos. This transition produces
an inversion of the lepton gradient in the innermost regions of the flow which
drives convective motions, and affects the density and disk scale height radial
profiles. The electron fraction remains low in the region close to the black
hole, and if preserved in an outflow, could give rise to heavy element
nucleosynthesis. Our specific initial conditions arise from the binary merger
context, and so we explore the implications of our results for the production
of gamma ray bursts.",2005-06-06T18:58:03Z
"On Bars, Haloes, their Interaction and their Orbital Structure","A live halo plays an active role in the formation and evolution of bars by
participating in the angular momentum redistribution which drives the dynamical
evolution. Angular momentum is emitted mainly by near-resonant material in the
bar region and is absorbed mainly by near-resonant material in the halo and in
the outer disc. This exchange determines the strength of the bar, the decrease
of its pattern speed, as well as its morphology. Thus, contrary to previous
beliefs, a halo can help the bar grow, so that bars growing in galaxies with
responsive massive haloes can become stronger than bars growing in disc
dominated galaxies. During the evolution the halo does not stay axisymmetric.
It forms a bar which is shorter and fatter than the disc bar and stays so all
through the simulation, although its length grows considerably with time. I
discuss the orbital structure in the disc and the halo and compare it with
periodic orbits in analytical barred galaxy potentials. A central mass
concentration (e.g. a central black hole, or a central disc) weakens a bar and
increases its pattern speed. The effect of the central mass concentration
depends strongly on the model, being less strong in models with a massive
concentrated halo and a strong bar.",2005-04-29T14:50:05Z
"Probing the existence of the E_peak-E_iso correlation in long Gamma Ray
  Bursts","We probe the existence of the E_peak-E_iso correlation in long GRBs using a
sample of 442 BATSE bursts with known E_peak and with redshift estimated
through the lag-luminosity correlation. This sample confirms that the rest
frame peak energy is correlated with the isotropic equivalent energy. The
distribution of the scatter of the points around the best fitting line is
similar to that obtained with the 27 bursts with spectroscopic redshifts. We
interpret the scatter in the E_peak-E_iso plane as due to the opening angle
distribution of GRB jets. By assuming that the collimation corrected energy
correlates with E_peak we can derive the observed distribution of the jet
opening angles, which turns out to be log-normal with a peak value of ~6.5
degrees.",2005-02-09T14:04:05Z
Projection effects in cluster mass estimates : the case of MS2137,"We revisit the mass properties of the lensing cluster of galaxies MS2137-23
and assess the mutual agreement between cluster mass estimates based on
lensing, X-rays and stellar dynamics. We perform a thorough elliptical lens
modelling using arcs in the range 20<R<100kpc and weak lensing (100<R<1000kpc).
We confirm that the dark matter distribution is consistent with an NFW profile
with high concentration $c=11.7\pm0.6$. We further analyse the stellar
kinematics data of Sand etal(2004) with a detailed modelling of the los
velocity distribution of stars in the cD galaxy and quantify the small bias due
to non-Gaussianity of the LOSVD. After correction, the NFW lens model is still
unable to properly fit kinematical data and is twice as massive as suggested by
X-rays (Allen etal2001). The discrepancy between projected and tridimensional
mass estimates is studied by assuming prolate (triaxial) halos with the major
axis oriented toward the line-of-sight. This model well explains the high
concentration and the misalignement of 13 deg between stellar and dark matter
components. We then calculate the systematic and statistical uncertainties in
the relative normalization between cylindric M(< R) and spherical M(< r) mass
estimates for triaxial halos. These uncertainties prevent any attempt to couple
2D and 3D constraints without a complete tridimensional analysis. Such
asphericity/projection effects should be a major concern for comparisons
between lensing and X-rays/dynamics mass estimates.",2005-03-31T13:44:03Z
Collisionless Plasma Shocks. Field Generation and Particle Acceleration,"Gamma ray bursts are among the most energetic events in the known universe. A
highly relativistic fireball is ejected. In most cases the burst itself is
followed by an afterglow, emitted under deceleration as the fireball plunges
through the circum-stellar media. To interpret the observations of the
afterglow emission, two physical aspects need to be understood: 1) The origin
and nature of the magnetic field in the fireball and 2) the particle velocity
distribution function behind the shock. Both are necessary in existing
afterglow models to account for what is believed to be synchrotron radiation.
To answer these questions, we need to understand the microphysics at play in
collisionless shocks. Using 3D particle-in-cell simulations we can gain insight
in the microphysical processes that take place in such shocks. We discuss the
results of such computer experiments. It is shown how a Weibel-like two-stream
plasma instability is able to create a strong transverse intermittent magnetic
field and points to a connected mechanism for in situ particle acceleration in
the shock region.",2005-03-16T15:57:03Z
Outbursts on normal stars. FH Leo misclassified as a novalike variable,"We present high resolution spectroscopy of the common proper motion system FH
Leo (components HD 96273 and BD+07 2411B), which has been classified as a
novalike variable due to an outburst observed by Hipparcos, and we present and
review the available photometry. We show from our spectra that neither star can
possibly be a cataclysmic variable, instead they are perfectly normal late-F
and early-G stars. We measured their radial velocities and derived the
atmospheric fundamental parameters, abundances of several elements including
Fe, Ni, Cr, Co, V, Sc, Ti, Ca and Mg, and we derive the age of the system. From
our analysis we conclude that the stars do indeed constitute a physical binary.
However, the observed outburst cannot be readily explained. We examine several
explanations, including pollution with scattered light from Jupiter, binarity,
microlensing, background supernovae, interaction with unseen companions and
planetary engulfment. While no explanation is fully satisfactory, the scattered
light and star-planet interaction scenarios emerge as the least unlikely ones,
and we give suggestions for further study.",2005-04-15T10:34:17Z
"VLBA Identification of the Milliarcsecond Active Nucleus in the Seyfert
  Galaxy NGC 4151","The Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151 has been imaged at resolution better than 0.1 pc
using a VLBI array consisting of the VLBA and three 100m-class telescopes. A
flat-spectrum 3-mJy source with a monochromatic radio power of ~10^{37} ergs/s
has been detected, apparently at the location of the active galactic nucleus
(AGN) and its central black hole. The radio source has a minimum brightness
temperature of 2.1 x 10^8 K and a size upper limit of 0.035 pc, about 10 times
the diameter of the broad-line region and 15,000 times the diameter of the
black hole's event horizon. An additional flat-spectrum component located
within a parsec of the apparent nucleus is likely to be a knot in the inner
radio jet. The presence of some steep-spectrum radio emission within 0.1 pc of
the galaxy nucleus limits the emission measure of a possible ionized torus to a
maximum value of 10^8 cm^{-6}pc. If the hard X-ray source in NGC 4151 is
associated with the radio AGN, its radio to X-ray ratio is less than 10^{-5},
putting NGC 4151 securely in the radio-quiet class of AGNs. The radio image
reveals a 0.2 pc two-sided base to the well-known arcsecond radio jet. Apparent
speeds of jet components relative to the radio AGN are <0.050c and <0.028c at
respective nuclear distances of 0.16 pc and 6.8 pc. These are the lowest speed
limits yet found for a Seyfert galaxy, and indicate non-relativistic jet
motions, possibly due to thermal plasma, on a scale only an order of magnitude
larger than the broad-line region.",2005-05-07T04:53:30Z
"GRBs Optical follow-up observation at Lulin observatory, Taiwan","The Lulin GRB program, using the Lulin One-meter Telescope (LOT) in Taiwan
started in July 2003. Its scientific aims are to discover optical counterparts
of XRFs and short and long GRBs, then to quickly observe them in multiple
bands. Thirteen follow-up observations were provided by LOT between July 2003
and Feb. 2005. One host galaxy was found at GRB 031203. Two optical afterglows
were detected for GRB 040924 and GRB 041006. In addition, the optical
observations of GRB 031203 and a discussion of the non-detection of the optical
afterglow of GRB 031203 are also reported in this article.",2005-06-10T15:45:08Z
Swift observations of GRB050128: the early X-ray afterglow,"Swift discovered GRB050128 with the Burst Alert Telescope and promptly
pointed its narrow field instruments to monitor the afterglow. X-ray
observations started 108 s after the trigger time. The early decay of the
afterglow is relatively flat with a temporal decay modeled with a power law
with index ~ -0.3. A steepening occurs at later times (~ 1500 s) with a power
law index of ~ -1.3. During this transition, the observed X-ray spectrum does
not change. We interpret this behaviour as either an early jet break or
evidence for a transition from the fast cooling regime to the slow cooling
regime in a wind environment.",2005-04-14T15:53:48Z
"Unification in the low radio luminosity regime; evidence from optical
  line emission","We address the question of whether or not the properties of all
low-luminosity flat spectrum radio sources, not just the obvious BL Lac
objects, are consistent with them being the relativistically beamed
counterparts of the low radio luminosity radio galaxies (the Fanaroff-Riley
type 1 - FRI). We compare the emission-line luminosities of a well studied
sample of core-dominated radio sources with a matched sample of FR I radio
galaxies. The emission lines in the core-dominated objects are on average
significantly more luminous than those in the comparison sample, inconsistent
with the simplest unified models in which there is no orientation dependence of
the line emission. However, the results are equally consistent with a scenario
in which, for the majority of objects, beaming has minimal effect on the
observed core luminosities of a large fraction of the FRI population and that
intrinsically stronger cores simply give rise to stronger emission lines. We
conclude that FRI unification is much more complex than usually portrayed, and
models combining beaming with an intrinsic relationship between core and
emission line strengths need to be explored.",2005-05-09T16:10:36Z
"Millimeter Wave Observations of the Core-Jet and Molecular Gas in the FR
  I Radio Galaxy NGC 3801","We present BIMA 3 mm observations of the radio continuum source and the
molecular gas disk in the radio loud Fanaroff & Riley Type I (FR I)galaxy
NGC3801.We have detected a continuum source in the nucleus and determined that
it has a flat millimeter-wave spectrum, suggesting that the emission is
non-thermal and due to an AGN; the radio core is not evident in existing VLA
observations. We also map the extended 3 mm emission from the previously known
radio jets. In addition, we detect CO (1--0) emission associated with the dust
disk observed in previous HST images. A velocity gradient is observed,
indicating a two kpc radius rotating gas ring or disk oriented roughly
perpendicular to the radio jets. The inferred molecular gas mass of the disk is
$M(H_{2})=3\times10^{8}M_{\odot}$, about 1% of the dynamical mass. We also find
a $\sim 10^8$ M$_\odot$ molecular gas clump not associated with the gas disk.
There is evidence that this gas is associated with a merger and is infalling.
This suggests that FR I type activity is related to merger activity, as is
thought to be the case for FR II type radio galaxies. We also find indications
that one of the radio jets is entraining gas from the infalling molecular gas.",2005-05-13T15:07:56Z
Near-infrared imaging of 222 nearby Hdelta-strong galaxies from the SDSS,"We present UFTI K-band imaging observations of 222 galaxies that are selected
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to have unusually strong Hdelta absorption
equivalent widths, W(Hd)>4A. Using GIM2D, the images are fit with
two-dimensional surface brightness models consisting of a simple disk and bulge
component to derive B/T, the fraction of luminosity in the bulge. We find that
the galaxies with weak or absent Halpha or [OII] emission (known as k+a
galaxies) are predominantly bulge-dominated (with a mode of B/T~0.6), while
galaxies with nebular emission (known as e[a] galaxies) are mostly
disk-dominated (B/T~0.1). The morphologies and (r-k) colours of most k+a
galaxies are inconsistent with the hypothesis that they result from the
truncation of star formation in normal, spiral galaxies. However, their (u-g)
and (r-k) colours, as well as their Hdelta line strengths, form a sequence that
is well matched by a model in which >5 per cent of the stellar mass has been
produced in a recent starburst. The lack of scatter in the dust-sensitive (r-k)
colours suggests that the unusual spectra of k+a galaxies are not due to the
effects of dust. The e(a) galaxies, on the other hand, have a colour
distribution that is distinct from the k+a population, and typical of normal or
dusty (tauV~2) spiral galaxies. We conclude that many e(a) galaxies are not
progenitors of k+a galaxies, but are a separate phenomenon. Both k+a and e(a)
galaxies reside in environments (characterized by the local density of galaxies
brighter than Mr=-20) that are typical of normal galaxies and that are
inconsistent with overdense regions like rich galaxy clusters.",2005-03-29T23:19:55Z
Haloes of k-Essence,"We study gravitationally bound static and spherically symmetric
configurations of k-essence fields. In particular, we investigate whether these
configurations can reproduce the properties of dark matter haloes. The classes
of Lagrangians we consider lead to non-isotropic fluids with barotropic and
polytropic equations of state. The latter include microscopic realizations of
the often-considered Chaplygin gases, which we find can cluster into dark
matter halo-like objects with flat rotation curves, while exhibiting a dark
energy-like negative pressure on cosmological scales. We complement our studies
with a series of formal general results about the stability and initial value
formulation of non-canonical scalar field theories, and we also discuss a new
class of de Sitter solutions with spacelike field gradients.",2005-05-10T18:34:55Z
"Cosmic 21-cm Delensing of Microwave Background Polarization and the
  Minimum Detectable Energy Scale of Inflation","The curl (B) modes of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization
anisotropies are a unique probe of the primordial background of inflationary
gravitational waves (IGWs). Unfortunately, the B-mode polarization anisotropies
generated by gravitational waves at recombination are confused with those
generated by the mixing of gradient-mode (E-mode) and B-mode polarization
anisotropies as CMB photons propagate through the Universe and are
gravitationally lensed. We describe here a method for delensing CMB
polarization anisotropies using observations of anisotropies in the cosmic
21-cm radiation emitted or absorbed by neutral hydrogen atoms at redshifts 10
to 200. While the detection of cosmic 21-cm anisotropies at high resolution is
challenging, a combined study with a relatively low-resolution (but
high-sensitivity) CMB polarization experiment could probe inflationary energy
scales well below the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) scale of 10^{16} GeV --
constraining models with energy scales below 10^{15} GeV (the detectable limit
derived from CMB observations alone). The ultimate theoretical limit to the
detectable inflationary energy scale via this method may be as low as 3 \times
10^{14} GeV.",2005-02-28T01:18:18Z
"Galaxy clustering from COMBO-17: The halo occupation distribution at
  <z>=0.6","We present measurements of galaxy clustering at redshift <z>=0.6 using 10360
galaxies with photometric redshifts over an area of 0.78 square degree from the
COMBO-17 survey. To obtain a result that is unaffected by redshift
uncertainties, we calculate the projected correlation function w(r_p), giving
results for red sequence and blue cloud galaxies separately. The correlation
function of the red galaxies displays clear deviations from a power law at
comoving separations around 1 to 3 h^-1 Mpc, and similar but weaker trends are
suggested by the data for the blue galaxies. To interpret these results, we fit
the correlation functions with analytical predictions derived from a simple
halo occupation model. This combines linear clustering of the underlying mass
with a description of the number of galaxies occupying each dark-matter halo
(the halo occupation distribution). If the occupation numbers are taken to be a
simple power law with N proportional to M^alpha, then alpha ~ 0.5 and alpha ~
0.2 for red and blue galaxies respectively. These figures are little different
from the values required to fit present-day clustering data. The power-spectrum
shape is assumed to be known in this exercise, but we allow the data to
determine the preferred value of sigma_8, the linear power-spectrum
normalization. The average normalization inferred from red and blue galaxies at
<z> =0.6 is sigma_8=1.02+-0.17 at zero redshift, consistent with independent
estimates of this local value. This agreement can be regarded as a verification
of the hierarchical growth of the halo mass function.",2005-06-14T20:02:13Z
A Simple Model for Quintessential Inflation,"We describe a simple toy model for quintessential inflation where a complex
scalar field described by a lagrangian with a Peccei-Quinn U(1) symmetry
spontaneously broken at a high energy scale and explicitly broken by instanton
effects at a much lower energy can account for both the early inflationary
phase and the recent accelerated expansion of the Universe. The real part of
the complex field plays the role of the inflaton whereas the imaginary part,
the ""axion"", is the quintessence field.",2005-04-07T20:42:35Z
"Detection of gamma-ray lines from interstellar 60Fe by the high
  resolution spectrometer SPI","It is believed that core-collapse supernovae (CCSN), occurring at a rate
about once per century, have seeded the interstellar medium with long-lived
radioisotopes such as 60Fe (half-life 1.5 Myr), which can be detected by the
gamma rays emitted when they beta-decay. Here we report the detection of the
60Fe decay lines at 1173 keV and 1333 keV with fluxes 3.7 +/- 1.1 x 10(-5) ph
cm(-2) s(-1) per line, in spectra taken by the SPI spectrometer on board
INTEGRAL during its first year. The same analysis applied to the 1809 keV line
of 26Al yielded a line flux ratio 60Fe/26Al = 0.11 +/- 0.03. This supports the
hypothesis that there is an extra source of 26Al in addition to CCSN.",2005-02-10T16:21:30Z
Discovery of Strong Lensing by an Elliptical Galaxy at z=0.0345,"We have discovered strong gravitational lensing by the galaxy ESO325-G004, in
images obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space
Telescope. The lens galaxy is a boxy group-dominant elliptical at z=0.0345,
making this the closest known galaxy-scale lensing system. The lensed object is
very blue (B-I = 1.1), and forms two prominent arcs and a less extended third
image. The Einstein radius is R_Ein=1.9 kpc (~3 arcsec on the sky, cf. 12
arcsec effective radius of the lens galaxy). Assuming a high redshift for the
source, the mass within R_Ein is 1.4x10^11 M_sun, and the I-band mass-to-light
ratio is 1.8 (M/L)_sun. The equivalent velocity dispersion is sigma_lens=310
km/s, in excellent agreement with the measured stellar dispersion sigma_v=320
km/s. Modeling the lensing potential with a singular isothermal ellipse (SIE),
we find close agreement with the light distribution. The best fit SIE model
reproduces the ellipticity of the lens galaxy to ~10%, and its position angle
within 1 degree. The model predicts the broad features of the arc geometry as
observed; the unlensed magnitude of the source is estimated at I ~ 23.75. We
suggest that one in ~200 similarly-massive galaxies within z<0.1 will exhibit
such a luminous multiply-imaged source.",2005-04-21T16:51:09Z
"A Note on ""Probing the existence of the $E_{peak}$-$E_{iso}$ correlation
  in long Gamma Ray Bursts"" by Ghirlanda et al. - astro-ph/0502186","In Nakar & Piran (2004) we have shown that a large fraction of BATSE bursts
cannot satisfy the Amati relation between the isotropic energy - peak energy of
GRBs. Our results have been corroborated by a further analysis carried out by
Band and Preece (2005). Recently Ghirlanda et al. (2005) claimed that when the
exact distribution of the scatter around the Amati relation is taken into
account, the BATSE sample is consistent with the Amati relation. We show that
the probability that the BATSE sample is consistent with the Amati relation
(including the scattering), as found by Ghirlanda et al. (2005) for a sample of
23 bursts with known redshift, is vanishingly small.",2005-03-23T22:38:25Z
INTEGRAL & RXTE Power Spectra of Cygnus X-1,"We evaluate 0.03-20 Hz power spectra of the bright black hole binary Cyg X-1
obtained from non-deconvolved INTEGRAL-ISGRI event data. The ISGRI power
spectra are compared to contemporary RXTE-PCA ones in the same hard X-ray
energy band of 15-70 keV. They agree well in shape. Since the ISGRI power
spectrum of Cyg X-1 is not background corrected it lies about an order of
magnitude below the PCA values. In 2003 a soft outburst of Cyg X-1 occurred.
  From the RXTE-ASM and Ryle radio long term lightcurves and the RXTE spectra
we see a canonical ``hard state -- intermediate state -- soft state''
evolution. We discuss the evolution of the power spectra in the 15-70 keV range
which so far is much less well studied than that at softer energies. We
interpret our results regarding the origin of certain variability components.",2005-04-18T23:01:44Z
"Low-Energy Hadron Production Data and Current Status of CERN
  Measurements","Data on low-energy hadron production in collisions of nucleons, pions and
kaons with light nuclei are needed for many astrophysical and accelerator
applications. Modern simulations have reached a level of accuracy that the lack
of detailed understanding of hadron production processes has become one of the
most important limitations to further improvements. After giving some examples
of hadroproduction processes in astrophysics and neutrino experiments we
briefly review existing fixed-target data on light nuclei. Preliminary results
and prospects of current CERN measurements (HARP, NA49) are discussed.",2005-04-15T18:07:41Z
A Universal Density Profile for Dark and Luminous Matter?,"We explore similarities in the luminosity distribution of early type galaxies
and the mass profiles of LCDM halos. The spatial structure of these systems may
be accurately described by a simple law where the logarithmic slope of the
projected density is a power law of radius; the Sersic law. We show that this
law provides a significantly better fit than a three-parameter generalization
of the NFW profile and derive the best-fitting Sersic parameters for a set of
high-resolution LCDM halos spanning a wide range in mass. The mean Sersic n
values are 3.0 for dwarf- and galaxy-sized halos and 2.4 for cluster-sized
halos, similar to the values that characterize luminous elliptical galaxies. We
discuss possible reasons why the same law should describe dark and luminous
systems that span a range of over seven decades in mass.",2005-02-24T17:36:28Z
Evolution of galaxies in clusters,"I summarize what is know about the evolution of galaxies in clusters from the
observational point of view presenting results at high (z~1), intermediate
(z~0.5) and low (z~0) redshifts. I comment on the comparison between
observations and predictions of CDM models, highlighting the observational
landmarks more relevant for this comparison, such as the establishment and
evolution of the morphology-density relation, the Butcher-Oemler effect, the
evolution of red galaxies/ellipticals, the star formation histories of galaxies
in clusters, the downsizing effect and the history of mass assembly.",2005-03-09T15:00:59Z
"Revised orbital parameters of the accreting millisecond pulsar SAX
  J1808.4-3658","We present temporal analysis of the three outbursts of the X-ray millisecond
pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 that occurred in 1998, 2000 and 2002. With a technique
that uses the chi^2 obtained with an epoch folding search to discriminate
between different possible orbital solutions, we find an unique solution valid
over the whole five years period for which high temporal resolution data are
available. We revise the estimate of the orbital period, P_orb =7249.1569(1) s
and reduce the corresponding error by one order of magnitude with respect to
that previously reported. Moreover we report the first constraint on the
orbital period derivative, -6.6 x 10^-12 < Pdot < +0.8 x 10^-12 s/s. These
values allow us to produce, via a folding technique, pulse profiles at any
given time. Analysis of these profiles shows that the pulse shape is clearly
asymmetric in 2002, occasionally showing a secondary peak at about 145 degrees
from the main pulse, which is quite different from the almost sinusoidal shape
reported at the beginning of the 1998 outburst.",2005-05-05T14:14:56Z
The Difference Between the Amati and Ghirlanda Relations,"It is pointed out that the beaming correction commonly inferred from the
achromatic breaks in the afterglow light curve is biased in situations where
the isotropic equivalent energy is affected by factors other than the spread in
opening angles. In particular, it underestimates the beaming factor of sources
observed off-axis. Here we show that both the slopes and scatters in the Amati
and Ghirlanda relations, and the difference between them, are quantitatively
consistent with a model proposed recently, in which the $E_{iso}-\nu_{peak}$
relation, as originally derived by Amati et al., is due to viewing angle
effects. The quantitative difference between them confirms the relations
between opening angle and break time suggested by Frail et al.",2005-04-05T20:03:38Z
"Is the Bursting Radio-source GCRT J1745-3009 a Double Neutron Star
  Binary ?","GCRT J1745-3009 is a peculiar transient radio-source in the direction of the
Galactic Center. It was observed to emit a series of ~ 1 Jy bursts at 0.33 GHz,
with typical duration ~ 10 min and at apparently regular intervals of ~ 77 min.
If the source is indeed at the distance of the Galactic Center as it seems
likely, we show that its observational properties are compatible with those
expected from a double neutron star binary, similar to the double pulsar system
J0737-3039. In the picture we propose the (coherent) radio emission comes from
the shock originating in the interaction of the wind of the more energetic
pulsar with the magnetosphere of the companion. The observed modulation of the
radio signal is the consequence of an eccentric orbit, along which the
separation between the two stars varies. This cyclically drives the shock
inside the light cylinder radius of the less energetic pulsar.",2005-06-09T12:36:14Z
"FUSE Measurements of Far Ultraviolet Extinction. II. Magellanic Cloud
  Sight Lines","We present an extinction analysis of 9 paths through the LMC and SMC based on
FUSE observations. To date, just two LMC sight lines have probed dust grain
composition and size distributions in the Clouds using spectra including
wavelengths as short as 950 A. We supplement these with results from 4 regions
distinguished by their IR through UV extinction curves and grouped as LMCAvg,
LMC2, SMC bar and SMC wing. Despite the distinct characters of Milky Way and
Magellanic Cloud extinction, our results are generally analogous to those found
for Galactic curves in that the FUSE portions of each extinction curve are
described reasonably well by FM curves fitted only to longer wavelength data
and lack any dramatic new extinction features, and any deviations from the CCM
formalism continue into FUV wavelengths. An MEM analysis of these curves
suggests that LMCAvg and SMC wing sight lines require more silicon and/or
carbon in dust than current abundance measurements would allow, while the
requirements for LMC2 and SMC bar sight lines do not fully tax the available
reservoirs. An intermediate product of this analysis is the measurement of new
H_2 abundances in the Magellanic Clouds. Collectively considering Cloud sight
lines that possess significant H_2 column densities, E(B-V)/N(HI) ratios are
reduced by significant factors relative to the Galactic mean, whereas the
corresponding E(B-V)/N(H_2) values more closely resemble their Galactic
counterpart. These trends reflect the fact that among these sight lines
f(H_2)-values are lower than those common in the Milky Way for paths with
similar degrees of reddening.",2005-05-19T19:15:30Z
Pulsars as Tools for Fundamental Physics and Astrophysics,"The sheer number of pulsars discovered by the SKA, in combination with the
exceptional timing precision it can provide, will revolutionize the field of
pulsar astrophysics. The SKA will provide a complete census of pulsars in both
the Galaxy and in Galactic globular clusters that can be used to provide a
detailed map of the electron density and magnetic fields, the dynamics of the
systems, and their evolutionary histories. This complete census will provide
examples of nearly every possible outcome of the evolution of massive stars,
including the discovery of very exotic systems such as pulsar black-hole
systems and sub-millisecond pulsars, if they exist. These exotic systems will
allow unique tests of the strong field limit of relativistic gravity and the
equation of state at extreme densities. Masses of pulsars and their binary
companions -- planets, white dwarfs, other neutron stars, and black holes --
will be determined to $\sim 1$% for hundreds of objects. With the SKA we can
discover and time highly-stable millisecond pulsars that comprise a
pulsar-timing array for the detection of low-frequency gravitational waves. The
SKA will also provide partial censuses of nearby galaxies through periodicity
and single-pulse detections, yielding important information on the
intergalactic medium.",2005-05-27T14:20:44Z
"Membership of the Orion Nebula Population from the Chandra Orion
  Ultradeep Project","The Chandra Orion Ultradeep project (COUP) observation described in a
companion paper by Getman et al. provides an exceptionally deep X-ray survey of
the Orion Nebula Cluster and associated embedded young stellar objects.
Membership of the region is important for studies of the stellar IMF, cluster
dynamics, and star formation. The COUP study detected 1616 X-ray sources. In
this study we confirm cloud membership for 1315 stars, identify 16 probable
foreground field stars having optical counterparts with discrepant proper
motions, and classify the remaining 285 X-ray sources, of which 51 are lightly
and 234 heavily obscured. The 51 lightly obscured sources without known
counterparts fall into three groups. (i) Sixteen are likely new members of the
Orion Nebula Cluster. (ii) Two with unusually soft and non-flaring X-ray
emission appear to be associated with nebular shocks, and may be new examples
of X-rays produced at the bow shocks of Herbig-Haro outflows. (iii) The
remaining thirty three are very weak uncertain sources, possibly spurious. Out
of 234 heavily absorbed sources without optical or near-infrared counterparts
75 COUP sources are likely new embedded cloud members (with membership for 42
confirmed by powerful X-ray flares), and the remaining 159 are likely
extragalactic AGN seen through the molecular cloud, as argued by a careful
simulation of the extragalactic background population. Finally, a few new
binary companions to Orion stars may have been found, but most cases of
proximate COUP sources can be attributed to chance superpositions in this
crowded field.",2005-04-17T23:54:17Z
On the Exotic Hard X-ray Source Populations in the Hellas2XMM survey,"Recent hard X-ray surveys have proven to be effective in discovering large
numbers of X-ray sources that, despite the likely association with active
nuclei, appear to be characterized by ""peculiar"" properties. Among these
""exotic"" source populations, we will focus on the nature of two classes of hard
X-ray sources: those characterized by high X-ray-to-optical flux ratios -- a
fraction of these are associated with the rather elusive Type 2 quasars -- and
the X-ray bright optically normal galaxies, also known as XBONGs.",2005-04-12T20:00:12Z
Populations of AGB stars and LPVs in the Galaxy and Local Group,"In this review I will discuss recent developments on the topic of resolved
Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars and Long Period Variables (LPVs) in our
Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds, and the Local Group in general. Since the main
characteristics of AGB stars are (1) their infrared, (2) pulsational and (3)
chemical properties, it is fitting that I will focus on recent results from the
(a) 2MASS/DENIS and MSX near- and mid-IR surveys, the (b) micro-lensing surveys
and (c) dedicated narrow-band imaging surveys.",2005-06-16T14:07:46Z
The red optical afterglow of GRB 030725,"We present a photometric study of the optical counterpart of the
long-duration Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) 030725, which triggered the HETE FREGATE
and WXM instruments on July 25th, 2003, and lasted more than 160s. An optical
counterpart was identified at the Bronberg Observatory in South Africa about 7
hours after the burst occurred. The optical afterglow (OA) was observed between
4 and 15 days after the burst with the 1.54m Danish telescope at La Silla in
the V, Rc, and Ic bands. We fit a broken power law to the data and determine a
break time in the light curve between 16 hours and 4.7 days after the first
detection of the burst. The decay slope is alpha1 = -0.59 +0.59/-0.44 before
and alpha2 = -1.43 +/- 0.06 after the break. A bump may be present in the light
curve, only significant at the 2-sigma level, 13.9 days after the main burst.
The spectral slope of the OA, measured 12 days after the burst, is -2.9 +/- 0.6
, i.e. it falls in the extreme red end of the distribution of previous OA
spectral slopes. Observations of the field 8 months after the burst with the
EMMI instrument on the NTT telescope (La Silla) resulted in an upper limit of
Rc=24.7 mag for the host galaxy of GRB 030725. The OA of GRB 030725 was
discovered at a private, non-professional observatory and we point out that
with the current suite of gamma ray satellites, an effort to organize future
contributions of amateur observers may provide substantial help in GRB light
curve follow up efforts.",2005-05-12T09:26:55Z
"The near-IR Surface Brightness Method applied to six Cepheids in the
  young LMC cluster NGC1866","We present new near-IR light curves for six Cepheids in the young blue LMC
cluster NGC1866 as well as high precision radial velocity curves for ten
Cepheids in NGC1866 and two in NGC2031. For the six Cepheids in NGC1866 with
new J and K light curves we determine distances and absolute magnitudes by
applying the near-IR surface brightness method. We find that the formal error
estimates on the derived distances are underestimated by about a factor of two.
We find excellent agreement between the absolute magnitudes for the low
metallicity LMC Cepheids with the Period-Luminosity (P-L) relation determined
by the near-IR surface brightness (ISB) method for Galactic Cepheids suggesting
that the slope of the P-L relations for low metallicity and solar metallicity
samples could be very similar in contrast to other recent findings. Still there
appears to be significant disagreement between the observed slopes of the OGLE
based apparent P-L relations in the LMC and the slopes derived from ISB
analysis of Galactic Cepheids, and by inference for Magellanic Cloud Cepheids,
indicating a possible intrinsic problem with the ISB method itself. Resolving
this problem could reaffirm the P-L relation as the prime distance indicator
applicable as well to metallicities significantly different from the LMC value.",2005-06-06T12:02:08Z
Reionization History from Coupled CMB/21cm Line Data,"We study CMB secondary anisotropies produced by inhomogeneous reionization by
means of cosmological simulations coupled with the radiative transfer code
CRASH. The reionization history is consistent with the WMAP Thomson optical
depth determination. We find that the signal arising from this process
dominates over the primary CMB component for l > 4000 and reaches a maximum
amplitude of l(l+1)C_l/2\pi ~ 1.6 x 10^{-13} on arcmin scale, i.e. l as large
as several thousands. We then cross-correlate secondary CMB anisotropy maps
with neutral hydrogen 21cm line emission fluctuations obtained from the same
simulations. The two signals are highly anti-correlated on angular scales
corresponding to the typical size of HII regions (including overlapping) at the
21cm map redshift. We show how the CMB/21cm cross-correlation can be used to:
(a) study the nature of the reionization sources, (b) reconstruct the cosmic
reionization history, (c) infer the mean cosmic ionization level at any
redshift. We discuss the feasibility of the proposed experiment with
forthcoming facilities.",2005-02-21T16:12:35Z
Merger Dynamics of the Pair of Galaxy Clusters -- A399 and A401,"Convincing evidence of a past interaction between two rich clusters A399 and
A401 was recently found by the X-ray imaging observations. In this paper we
examine the structure and dynamics of this pair of galaxy clusters. A
mixture-modeling algorithm has been applied to obtain a robust partition into
two clusters, which allows us to discuss the virial mass and velocity
distribution for each cluster. Assuming that these two clusters follow a linear
orbit and they have once experienced a close encounter, we model the binary
cluster as a two-body system. As a result, four gravitationally bound solutions
are obtained. The recent X-ray observations seem to favor a scenario in which
the two clusters with a true separation of $5.4h^{-1}$ Mpc are currently
expanding at 583 km/s along the direction with a projection angle of 67.5
degree, and they will reach a maximum extent of $5.65h^{-1}$ Mpc in about
$1.0h^{-1}$ Gyr.",2005-02-28T01:24:32Z
Equation of state for Universe from similarity symmetries,"In this paper we proposed to use the group of analysis of symmetries of the
dynamical system to describe the evolution of the Universe. This methods is
used in searching for the unknown equation of state. It is shown that group of
symmetries enforce the form of the equation of state for noninteracting scaling
multifluids. We showed that symmetries give rise the equation of state in the
form $p=-\Lambda+w_{1}\rho(a)+w_{2}a^{\beta}+0$ and energy density
$\rho=\Lambda+\rho_{01}a^{-3(1+w)}+\rho_{02}a^{\beta}+\rho_{03}a^{-3}$, which
is commonly used in cosmology. The FRW model filled with scaling fluid (called
homological) is confronted with the observations of distant type Ia supernovae.
We found the class of model parameters admissible by the statistical analysis
of SNIa data. We showed that the model with scaling fluid fits well to
supernovae data. We found that $\Omega_{\text{m},0} \simeq 0.4$ and $n \simeq
-1$ ($\beta = -3n$), which can correspond to (hyper) phantom fluid, and to a
high density universe. However if we assume prior that
$\Omega_{\text{m},0}=0.3$ then the favoured model is close to concordance
$\Lambda$CDM model. Our results predict that in the considered model with
scaling fluids distant type Ia supernovae should be brighter than in
$\Lambda$CDM model, while intermediate distant SNIa should be fainter than in
$\Lambda$CDM model. We also investigate whether the model with scaling fluid is
actually preferred by data over $\Lambda$CDM model. As a result we find from
the Akaike model selection criterion prefers the model with noninteracting
scaling fluid.",2005-05-10T16:56:00Z
"Diffusive Synchrotron Radiation from Relativistic Shocks of Gamma-Ray
  Burst Sources","The spectrum of electromagnetic emission generated by relativistic electrons
scattered on small-scale random magnetic fields, implied by current models of
the magnetic field generation in the gamma-ray burst sources, is considered.
The theory developed includes both perturbative and non-perturbative versions
and, therefore, suggests a general treatment of the radiation in arbitrary
small-scale random field. It is shown that a general treatment of the random
nature of the small-scale magnetic field, as well as angular diffusion of the
electrons due to multiple scattering by magnetic inhomogeneities (i.e.,
non-perturbative effects), give rise to a radiation spectrum that differs
significantly from so-called ""jitter"" spectrum. The spectrum of diffusive
synchrotron radiation seems to be consistent with the low energy spectral index
distribution of the gamma-ray bursts.",2005-02-11T22:10:43Z
Limits on the primordial stellar multiplicity,"Most stars - especially young stars - are observed to be in multiple systems.
Dynamical evolution is unable to pair stars efficiently, which leads to the
conclusion that star-forming cores must usually fragment into \geq 2 stars.
However, the dynamical decay of systems with \geq 3 or 4 stars would result in
a large single-star population that is not seen in the young stellar
population. Additionally, ejections would produce a significant population of
hard binaries that are not observed. This leads to a strong constraint on star
formation theories that cores must typically produce only 2 or 3 stars. This
conclusion is in sharp disagreement with the results of currently available
numerical simulations that follow the fragmentation of molecular cores and
typically predict the formation of 5--10 seeds per core. In addition, open
cluster remnants may account for the majority of observed highly hierarchical
higher-order multiple systems in the field.",2005-05-23T11:25:58Z
Characterizing the Cluster Lens Population,"We present a detailed investigation into which properties of CDM halos make
them effective strong gravitational lenses. Strong lensing cross sections of
878 clusters from an N-body simulation are measured by ray tracing through
13,594 unique projections. We measure concentrations, axis ratios,
orientations, and the amount of substructure of each cluster, and compare the
lensing weighted distribution of each quantity to that of the cluster
population as a whole. The concentrations of lensing clusters are on average
34% larger than the typical cluster in the Universe. Despite this bias, the
anomalously high concentrations (c >14) recently measured by several groups,
appear to be inconsistent with the concentration distribution in our
simulations, which predict < 2% of lensing clusters should have concentrations
this high. No correlation is found between lensing cross section and the amount
of substructure. We introduce several types of simplified dark matter halos,
and use them to isolate which properties of CDM clusters make them effective
lenses. Projections of halo substructure onto small radii and the large scale
mass distribution of clusters do not significantly influence cross sections.
The abundance of giant arcs is primarily determined by the mass distribution
within an average overdensity of ~ 10,000. A multiple lens plane ray tracing
algorithm is used to show that projections of large scale structure increase
the giant arc abundance by a modest amount <7%. We revisit the question of
whether there is an excess of giant arcs behind high redshift clusters in the
RCS survey and find that the number of high redshift (z > 0.6) lenses is in
good agreement with LCDM, although our simulations predict more low redshift (z
< 0.6) lenses than were observed. (abridged)",2005-06-08T14:49:47Z
Patterns of energy-dependent variability from Comptonization,"We study fractional variability as a function of energy from black-hole X-ray
binaries on timescales from milliseconds to hundreds of seconds. We build a
theoretical model of energy-dependent variability in which the X-ray energy
spectrum varies in response to a changing physical parameter. We compare these
models to rms spectra obtained from RXTE PCA observations of black-hole
binaries XTE J1550-564 and XTE J1650-500. We show that two main variability
models are consistent with the data: variable seed photon input in the hard
state and variable power in the Comptonized component in the soft and very high
states. The lack of clear reflection features in the rms spectra implies that
the reflection and the X-ray continuum, when integrated over Fourier
frequencies, are correlated and vary with similar fractional amplitudes. Our
models predict two important features of rms spectra, not possible to be
clearly seen by the PCA due sensitivity limits. At soft X-rays, >~3 keV, we
predict the presence of a break in the rms spectrum at energy directly related
to the seed photon temperature. At higher energies, ~20--30 keV, we predict a
peak in the rms spectrum originating from the variability of the spectrum
produced by a hybrid thermal/non-thermal electron distribution. If these
features are confirmed by broad-band observations, they will impose important
constraints on the origin of the seed photons for Comptonization and the
electron distribution in the hot plasma.",2005-06-16T16:05:25Z
Elliptic CMB Sky,"The ellipticity of the anisotropy spots of the Cosmic Microwave Background
measured by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) has been studied.
We find an average ellipticity of about 2, confirming with a far larger
statistics similar results found first for the COBE-DMR CMB maps, and then for
the BOOMERanG CMB maps. There are no preferred directions for the obliquity of
the anisotropy spots. The average ellipticity is independent of temperature
threshold and is present on scales both smaller and larger than the horizon at
the last scattering. The measured ellipticity characteristics are consistent
with being the effect of geodesics mixing occurring in an hyperbolic Universe,
and can mark the emergence of CMB ellipticity as a new observable constant
describing the Universe. There is no way of simulating this effect. Therefore
we cannot exclude that the observed behavior of the measured ellipticity can
result from a trivial topology in the popular flat $\Lambda$-CDM model, or from
a non-trivial topology.",2005-03-04T18:11:21Z
Physical conditions in the Homunculus,"Conditions within the Homunculus nebula around Eta Car are determined by many
of the same physical processes that occur in molecular clouds in the
interstellar medium. But there is one major exception -- we know when the
ejection occurred and something about its composition and initial state. The
gas was warm, ionized, and dust-free when it was located within the star's
atmosphere and it is currently cold, molecular, and dusty. It undertook this
transformation in a bit over 150 years. It offers a laboratory for the study of
physical processes in a well-constrained environment. We derive a
photoionization model of the Homunculus nebula that reproduces many of its
observed properties. We conclude by outlining how observations of the
Homunculus could address basic problems in the physics of the interstellar
medium.",2005-03-29T21:20:26Z
"Magnetically-Dominated Accretion Flows (MDAFs) and Jet Production in the
  Low/Hard STate","In this paper I propose that the inner part of a black hole accretion inflow
($< 100 r_{g}$) may enter a magnetically-dominated, magnetosphere-like phase in
which the strong, well-ordered fields play a more important role than weak,
turbulent fields. In the low/hard state this flow is interior to the standard
ADAF usually invoked to explain the observed hot, optically thin emission.
Preliminary solutions for these new MDAFs are presented.
  Time-dependent X-ray and radio observations give considerable insight into
these processes, and a new interpretation of the X-ray power spectrum (as
arising from many disk radii) may be in order. While an evaporative ADAF model
explains the noise power above 0.01 Hz, an inner MDAF is needed to explain the
high frequency cutoff near 1 Hz, the presence of a QPO, and the production of a
jet. The MDAF scenario also is consistent with the data-based, phemonenological
models presented at this meeting by several authors.",2005-04-22T21:39:12Z
"Rights and wrongs of the Hipparcos data: A critical assessment of the
  Hipparcos catalogue","A critical assessment of the quality of the Hipparcos data, partly supported
by a completely new analysis of the raw data, is presented with the aim of
clarifying reliability issues that have surfaced since the publication of the
Hipparcos catalogue in 1997. A number of defects in the data are identified,
such as scan-phase discontinuities and effects of external hits. These defects
can be repaired when re-reducing the raw data. Instabilities in the
great-circle reduction process are recognised and identified in a number of
data sets. These resulted mainly from the difficult observing conditions
imposed by the anomalous orbit of the satellite. The stability of the basic
angle over the mission is confirmed, but the connectivity between the two
fields of view has been less than optimal for some parts of the sky. Both are
fundamental conditions for producing absolute parallaxes. Although there is
clear room for improvement of the Hipparcos data, the catalogue as published
remains generally reliable within the quoted accuracies. Some of the findings
presented here are also relevant for the forthcoming Gaia mission.",2005-05-20T09:03:32Z
"Passively Evolving Early-type Galaxies at 1.4<z<2.5 in the Hubble Ultra
  Deep Field","We report on a complete sample of 7 luminous early-type galaxies in the
Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF) with spectroscopic redshifts between 1.39 and
2.47 and to K<23 AB. Using the BzK selection criterion we have pre-selected a
set of objects over the UDF which fulfill the photometric conditions for being
passively evolving galaxies at z>1.4. Low-resolution spectra of these objects
have been extracted from the HST+ACS grism data taken over the UDF by the
GRAPES project. Redshift for the 7 galaxies have been identified based on the
UV feature at rest frame 2640<lambda<2850 AA. This feature is mainly due to a
combination of FeII, MgI and MgII absorptions which are characteristic of
stellar populations dominated by stars older than about 0.5 Gyr. The redshift
identification and the passively evolving nature of these galaxies is further
supported by the photometric redshifts and by the overall spectral energy
distribution (SED), with the ultradeep HST+ACS/NICMOS imaging revealing compact
morphologies typical of elliptical/early-type galaxies. From the SED we derive
stellar masses of 10^{11}Msun or larger and ages of about 1 Gyr. Their space
density at < z >=1.7 appears to be roughly a factor of 2--3 smaller than that
of their local counterparts, further supporting the notion that such massive
and old galaxies are already ubiquitous at early cosmic times. Much smaller
effective radii are derived for some of the objects compared to local massive
ellipticals, which may be due to morphological K corrections, evolution, or the
presence of a central point-like source. Nuclear activity is indeed present in
a subset of the galaxies, as revealed by them being hard X-ray sources, hinting
to AGN activity having played a role in discontinuing star formation.",2005-03-04T17:48:27Z
Testing MOND with Ultra-Compact Dwarf Galaxies,"The properties of the recently discovered Ultra-Compact Dwarf Galaxies (UCDs)
show that their internal acceleration of gravity is everywhere above a0, the
MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) constant of gravity. MOND therefore makes
the strong prediction that no mass discrepancy should be observed for this
class of objects. This is confirmed by the few UCDs for which virial masses
were derived. We argue that UCD galaxies represent a suitable test-bench for
the theory, in the sense that even a single UCD galaxy showing evidence for
dark matter would seriously question the validity of MOND.",2005-04-03T10:51:05Z
"Radial Distribution of Production Rates, Loss Rates and Densities
  Corresponding to Ion Masses <=40 amu in the Inner Coma of Comet Halley:
  Composition and Chemistry","In this paper we have studied the chemistry of C, H, N, O, and S compounds
corresponding to ions of masses <=40 amu in the inner coma of the comet
1P/Halley. The production rates, loss rates, and ion mass densities are
calculated using the Analytical Yield Spectrum approach and solving coupled
continuity equation controlled by the steady state photochemical equilibrium
condition. The primary ionization sources in the model are solar EUV photons,
photoelectrons, and auroral electrons of the solar wind origin. The chemical
model couples ion-neutral, electron-neutral, photon-neutral and electron-ion
reactions among ions, neutrals, electrons, and photons through over 600
chemical reactions. Of the 46 ions considered in the model the chemistry of 24
important ions are discussed in this paper. The calculated ion mass densities
are compared with the Giotto Ion Mass Spectrometer (IMS) and Neutral Mass
Spectrometer (NMS) data at radial distances 1500, 3500, and 6000 km.",2005-04-29T17:16:25Z
"Effects of Rotation and Relativistic Charge Flow on Pulsar
  Magnetospheric Structure","We propose an analytical 3-D model of the open field-line region of a neutron
star (NS) magnetosphere. We construct an explicit analytic solution for
arbitrary obliquity (angle between the rotation and magnetic axes)
incorporating the effects of magnetospheric rotation, relativistic flow of
charges (e.g. primary electron beam) along the open field lines, and E X B
drift of these charges. Our solution employs the space-charge-limited
longitudinal current calculated in the electrodynamic model of Muslimov &
Tsygan (1992) and is valid up to very high altitudes nearly approaching the
light cylinder. We assume that in the innermost magnetosphere, the NS magnetic
field can be well represented by a static magnetic dipole configuration. At
high altitudes the open magnetic field lines significantly deviate from those
of a static dipole and tend to focus into a cylindrical bundle, swept back in
the direction opposite to the rotation, and also bent towards the rotational
equator. We briefly discuss some implications of our study to spin-powered
pulsars.",2005-05-09T20:23:54Z
Extracting New Physics from the CMB,"We review how initial state effects generically yield an oscillatory
component in the primordial power spectrum of inflationary density
perturbations. These oscillatory corrections parametrize unknown new physics at
a scale $M$ and are potentially observable if the ratio $H_{infl}/M$ is
sufficiently large. We clarify to what extent present and future CMB data
analysis can distinguish between the different proposals for initial state
corrections.",2005-03-21T21:42:49Z
"On the Eccentricities and Merger Rates of Double Neutron Star Binaries
  and the Creation of ""Double Supernovae""","We demonstrate that a natural consequence of an asymmetric kick imparted to
neutron stars at birth is that the majority of double neutron star binaries
should possess highly eccentric orbits. This leads to greatly accelerated
orbital decay, due to the enormous increase in the emission of gravitational
radiation at periastron as originally demonstrated by Peters (1964). A uniform
distribution of kick velocities constrained to the orbital plane would result
in ~24% of surviving binaries coalescing at least 10,000 times faster than an
unperturbed circular system. Even if the planar kick constraint is lifted, ~6%
of bound systems still coalesce this rapidly. In a non-negligible fraction of
cases it may even be possible that the system could coalesce within 10 years of
the final supernova, resulting in what we might term a ""double supernova''. For
systems resembling the progenitor of PSR J0737-3039A, this number is as high as
\~9% (in the planar kick model). Whether the kick velocity distribution extends
to the range required to achieve this is still unclear. We do know that the
observed population of binary pulsars has a deficit of highly eccentric systems
at small orbital periods. In contrast, the long-period systems favour large
eccentricities, as expected. We argue that this is because the short-period
highly eccentric systems have already coalesced and are thus selected against
by pulsar surveys. This effect needs to be taken into account when using the
scale-factor method to estimate the coalescence rate of double neutron star
binaries. We therefore assert that the coalesence rate of such binaries is
underestimated by a factor of several.",2005-04-01T12:01:33Z
A Simple and Accurate Model for Intra-Cluster Gas,"Starting with the well-known NFW dark matter halo distribution, we construct
a simple polytropic model for the intracluster medium which is in good
agreement with high resolution numerical hydrodynamical simulations, apply this
model to a very large scale concordance dark matter simulation, and compare the
resulting global properties with recent observations of X-ray clusters,
including the mass-temperature and luminosity-temperature relations. We make
allowances for a non-negligible surface pressure, removal of low entropy (short
cooling time) gas, energy injection due to feedback, and for a relativistic
(non-thermal) pressure component. A polytropic index n=5 (Gamma=1.2) provides a
good approximation to the internal gas structure of massive clusters (except in
the very central regions where cooling becomes important), and allows one to
recover the observed M_500-T, L_x-T, and T/n_e^{2/3} ~ T^0.65 relations. Using
these concepts and generalizing this method so that it can be applied to fully
three-dimensional N-body simulations, one can predict the global X-ray and SZE
trends for any specified cosmological model. We find a good fit to observations
when assuming that twelve percent of the initial baryonic mass condenses into
stars, the fraction of rest mass of this condensed component transferred back
to the remaining gas (feedback) is 3.9E-5, and the fraction of total pressure
from a nonthermal component is near ten percent.",2005-04-14T21:16:42Z
Light curves of oscillating neutron stars,"We calculate light curves produced by $r$-modes with small azimuthal
wavenumbers, $m$, propagating in the surface fluid ocean of rotating neutron
stars. We include relativistic effects due to rapid rotation, and propagate
photons from the stellar surface to a distant observer using the Schwarzschild
metric. The wave motions of the surface $r$-modes are confined to the
equatorial region of the star, and the surface pattern of the temperature
variation can be either symmetric (for even modes) or anti-symmetric (for odd
modes) with respect to the equator. Since for the surface $r$-modes the
oscillation frequency in the corotating frame of the star is much smaller than
the rotation frequency, $\Omega$, we employ the approximation in which the
oscillation frequency in the inertial frame, $\sigma$, is given by $\sigma=
-m\Omega$. We find that the $even$, $m = 1$ $r$-mode produces the largest light
variations. The dominant Fourier component in the light curves of these modes
is the fundamental having $\sigma=-\Omega$, and the first harmonic component
having $\sigma=-2\Omega$ is always negligible in comparison. The dominant
Fourier component of the even, $m=2$ $r$-modes is the first harmonic. Although
the $odd$ $r$-modes produce smaller amplitude light variations compared with
the $even$ modes, the light curves of the former have a stronger first harmonic
component. If both $m=1$ and 2 $r$-modes are excited simultaneously, a rich
variety of light curves is possible, including those having an appreciable
first harmonic component. We show that the phase difference, $\delta-\delta_E$,
between the bolometric light curve and that at a particular photon energy can
possibly be used as a probe of the stellar compactness, $R/M$, where $R$ and
$M$ are the radius and mass of the star.",2005-02-24T01:46:37Z
Modeling the resonant planetary system GJ876,"The two planets about the star GJ 876 appear to have undergone extensive
migration from their point of origin in the protoplanetary disk -- both because
of their close proximity to the star (30 and 60 day orbital periods) and
because of their occupying three stable orbital resonances at the 2:1
mean-motion commensurability. The resonances were most likely established by
converging differential migration of the planets leading to capture into the
resonances. A problem with this scenario is that continued migration of the
system while it is trapped in the resonances leads to orbital eccentricities
that rapidly exceed the observational upper limits of e_1 = 0.31 and e_2 =
0.05. As seen in forced 3-body simulations, lower eccentricities would persist
during migration only for an applied eccentricity damping.
  Here we explore the evolution of the GJ 876 system using two-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations that include viscous heating and radiative effects.
We find that a hydrodynamic evolution within the resonance, where only the
outer planet interacts with the disk, always rapidly leads to large values of
eccentricities that exceed those observed.
  Only if mass is removed from the disk on a time scale of the order of the
migration time scale (before there has been extensive migration after capture),
as might occur for photoevaporation in the late phases of planet formation, can
we end up with eccentricities that are consistent with the observations.",2005-03-27T13:21:57Z
"The first optical validation of an XLEO: a detection in the XMM-Newton
  observation of the CDFS","We present the first optical validation of an X-ray Line-Emitting Object
(XLEO) discovered in the XMM-Newton observation of the Chandra Deep Field
South. The object is an AGN at z_x ~ 0.66. An optical spectrum of the source
indeed confirms and refines (z_o = 0.665) the redshift obtained from the X-ray

discussed.",2005-02-04T10:17:30Z
GRAPE-6A: A single-card GRAPE-6 for parallel PC-GRAPE cluster system,"In this paper, we describe the design and performance of GRAPE-6A, a
special-purpose computer for gravitational many-body simulations. It was
designed to be used with a PC cluster, in which each node has one GRAPE-6A.
Such configuration is particularly effective in running parallel tree
algorithm. Though the use of parallel tree algorithm was possible with the
original GRAPE-6 hardware, it was not very cost-effective since a single
GRAPE-6 board was still too fast and too expensive. Therefore, we designed
GRAPE-6A as a single PCI card to minimize the reproduction cost and optimize
the computing speed. The peak performance is 130 Gflops for one GRAPE-6A board
and 3.1 Tflops for our 24 node cluster. We describe the implementation of the
tree, TreePM and individual timestep algorithms on both a single GRAPE-6A
system and GRAPE-6A cluster. Using the tree algorithm on our 16-node GRAPE-6A
system, we can complete a collisionless simulation with 100 million particles
(8000 steps) within 10 days.",2005-04-19T06:45:13Z
A tiny Galactic dust cloud projected onto NGC 3269?,"We report on new observations obtained with the Magellan Clay-telescope of a
tiny dust patch in the Sa-galaxy NGC 3269 in the Antlia galaxy cluster. It has
already been suspected to be a projected Galactic foreground cloud. In this
case a size of about 4 arcsec and a maximum absorption of ~1 mag in the B-band
would make it unique so far. We present further evidence for its Galactic
nature from imaging under excellent seeing conditions (0.3-0.6 arcsec). This
dust cloud could be the first optically identified counterpart of a new type of
molecular cloud recently discovered by Heithausen (2004).",2005-05-26T18:37:57Z
Weighing Neutrinos with Galaxy Cluster Surveys,"Large future galaxy cluster surveys, combined with cosmic microwave
background observations, can achieve a high sensitivity to the masses of
cosmologically important neutrinos. We show that a weak lensing selected sample
of ~100,000 clusters could tighten the current upper bound on the sum of masses
of neutrino species by an order of magnitude, to a level of 0.03 eV. Since this
statistical sensitivity is below the best existing lower limit on the mass of
at least one neutrino species, a future detection is likely, provided that
systematic errors can be controlled to a similar level.",2005-05-19T17:41:38Z
The pulsed X-ray light curves of the isolated neutron star RBS1223,"We present a multi-epoch spectral and timing analysis of the isolated neutron
star RBS1223. New XMM-Newton data obtained in January 2004 confirm the spin
period to be twice as long as previously thought, P_spin = 10.31 s. The
combined ROSAT, Chandra, XMM-Newton data (6 epochs) give, contrary to earlier
findings, no clear indication of a spin evolution of the neutron star. The
X-ray light curves are double-humped with pronounced hardness ratio variations
suggesting an inhomogeneous surface temperature with two spots separated by
about ~160 degr. The sharpness of the two humps suggests a mildly relativistic
star with a ratio between R_ns, the neutron star radius at source, and r_S, the
Schwarzschild-radius, of R_ns/r_S > 3.5. Assuming Planckian energy
distributions as local radiation sources, light curves were synthesized which
were found to be in overall qualitative agreement with observed light curves in
two different energy bands. The temperature distribution used was based on the
crustal field models by Geppert et al. (2004) for a central temperature of T_c
= 10^8 K and an external dipolar field of B ~ 10^{13} G. This gives a mean
atmospheric temperature of 55 eV. A much simpler model with two homogeneous
spots with T_\infty = 92 eV, and 84 eV, and a cold rest star, T_star,\infty <
45 eV, invisible at X-ray wavelengths, was found to be similarly successful.
The new temperature determination and the new dot(P)_{spin} suggest that the
star is older than previously thought, T \simeq 10^(5..6) yrs. The
model-dependent distance to RBS1223 is estimated between 76 pc and 380 pc (for
R_ns = 12 km).",2005-05-26T15:01:53Z
"Spectral lags and the energy dependence of pulse width in gamma-ray
  bursts: contributions from the relativistic curvature effect","We compute the temporal profiles of the gamma-ray burst pulse in the four
Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) Large Area Detector (LAD)
discriminator energy channels, with the relativistic curvature effect of a
expanding fireball being explicitly investigated. Assuming an intrinsic 'Band'
shape spectrum and an intrinsic energy-independent emission profile, we show
that merely the curvature effect can produce detectable spectral lags if the
intrinsic pulse profile has a gradually decaying phase. We examine the spectral
lag's dependences on some physical parameters, such as the Lorentz factor
\Gamma, the low-energy spectral index, \alpha, of the intrinsic spectrum, the
duration of the intrinsic radiation t_d' and the fireball radius R. It is shown
that approximately the lag \propto \Gamma ^{-1} and \propto t_d', and a
spectrum with a more extruded shape (a larger \alpha) causes a larger lag. We
find no dependence of the lag on R. Quantitatively, the lags produced from the
curvature effect are marginally close to the observed ones, while larger lags
require extreme physical parameter values, e.g., \Gamma < 50, or \alpha > -0.5.
The curvature effect causes an energy-dependent pulse width distribution but
the energy dependence of the pulse width we obtained is much weaker than the
observed W \propto E^{-0.4} one. This indicates that some intrinsic
mechanism(s), other than the curvature effect, dominates the pulse narrowing of
GRBs.",2005-05-13T09:01:49Z
"Properties of detached shells around carbon stars: Evidence of
  interacting winds","The nature of the mechanism responsible for producing the spectacular,
geometrically thin, spherical shells found around some carbon stars has been an
enigma for some time. Based on extensive radiative transfer modelling of both
CO line emission and dust continuum radiation for all objects with known
detached molecular shells, we present compelling evidence that these shells
show clear signs of interaction with a surrounding medium. The derived masses
of the shells increase with radial distance from the central star while their
velocities decrease. A simple model for interacting winds indicate that the
mass-loss rate producing the faster moving wind has to be almost two orders of
magnitudes higher (~10^-5 solar masses per year) than the slower AGB wind (a
few 10^-7 solar masses per year) preceding this violent event. At the same
time, the present-day mass-loss rates are very low indicating that the epoch of
high mass-loss rate was relatively short, on the order of a few hundred years.
This, together with the number of sources exhibiting this phenomenon, suggests
a connection with He-shell flashes (thermal pulses). We report the detection of
a detached molecular shell around the carbon star DR Ser, as revealed from new
single-dish CO (sub-)millimetre line observations. The properties of the shell
are similar to those characterising the young shell around U Cam.",2005-03-10T14:52:23Z
The Fall 2004 SDSS Supernova Survey,"In preparation for the Supernova Survey of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) II, a proposed 3-year extension to the SDSS, we have conducted an early
engineering and science run during the fall of 2004, which consisted of
approximately 20 scheduled nights of repeated imaging of half of the southern
equatorial stripe. Transient supernova-like events were detected in near
real-time and photometric measurements were made in the five SDSS filter
bandpasses with a cadence of ~2 days. Candidate type Ia supernovae (SNe) were
pre-selected based on their colors, light curve shape, and the properties of
the host galaxy. Follow-up spectroscopic observations were performed with the
Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5m telescope and the 9.2m Hobby-Eberly
Telescope to confirm their types and measure the redshifts. The 2004 campaign
resulted in 22 spectroscopically confirmed SNe, which includes 16 type Ia, 5
type II, and 1 type Ib/c. These SN Ia will help fill in the sparsely sampled
redshift interval of z = 0.05 - 0.35, the so-called 'redshift desert', in the
Hubble diagram. Detailed investigation of the spectral properties of these
moderate-redshift SNe Ia will also provide a bridge between local SNe and
high-redshift objects, and will help us understand the systematics for future
cosmological applications that require high photometric precision. Finally, the
large survey volume also provides the opportunity to select unusual supernovae
for spectroscopic study that are poorly sampled in other surveys. We report on
some of the early results from this program and discuss potential future
applications.",2005-04-20T20:34:03Z
Disc-Disc Encounters between Low-Mass Protoplanetary Accretion Discs,"Simulations of the collapse and fragmentation of turbulent molecular clouds
and dense young clusters show that encounters between disc-surrounded stars are
relatively common events which should significantly influence the resulting
disc structure. In turn this should alter the accretion rate of disc matter
onto the star and the conditions under which planet formation occurs. Although
the effects of star-disc encounters have been previously investigated, very
little is known about encounters where both stars are surrounded by discs. In
this paper encounters of such disc-disc systems are studied quantitatively. It
is found that for low-mass discs ($M_D$= 0.01 $M_\sun$) the results from
star-disc encounters can be straightforwardly generalized to disc-disc
encounters as long as there is no mass transport between the discs. Differences
to star-disc encounters occur naturally where significant amounts of matter are
transported between the discs. In this case it is found that although the mass
distribution does not change significantly, matter caught onto highly eccentric
orbits is transported surprisingly far inside the disc. The captured mass
partly replenishes the disc, but has a much lower angular momentum. This can
lead to a reduction of the angular momentum in the entire disc and thus
considerably increased accretion shortly after the encounter as well as in the
long term.",2005-04-27T08:23:51Z
"Simulating the joint evolution of quasars, galaxies and their
  large-scale distribution","The cold dark matter model has become the leading theoretical paradigm for
the formation of structure in the Universe. Together with the theory of cosmic
inflation, this model makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for
structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through
gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise
measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally
precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a novel framework for the
quantitative physical interpretation of such surveys. This combines the largest
simulation of the growth of dark matter structure ever carried out with new
techniques for following the formation and evolution of the visible components.
We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe
are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an
effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with next
generation surveys.",2005-04-05T07:08:11Z
"X-Ray Timing, Spectroscopy and Photometry of the Anomalous X-Ray Pulsar
  Candidate CXOU J010043.1-721134","We present new X-ray timing and spectral results on the 8.0-second X-ray
pulsar CXOU J010043.1-721134 from a series of observations using the Chandra
X-ray Observatory. We find a spin period in 2004 January of 8.020392pm0.000009
seconds. Comparison of this to 2001 Chandra observations implies a period
derivative dot{P} = (1.88 pm 0.08) times 10^{-11} s s^{-1}, leading to an
inferred dipole surface magnetic field of 3.9 times 10^{14} G. The spectrum is
well fit to an absorbed blackbody of temperature kT = 0.38pm0.02 keV with a
power law tail of photon index Gamma = 2.0pm0.6. We find that the source has an
unabsorbed X-ray flux (0.5-10 keV) of 4(+2-1) times 10^{-13} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}
and a corresponding X-ray luminosity of ~2 times 10^{35} erg s^{-1} for a
distance of 60 kpc. These properties support classification of CXOU
J010043.1-721134 as the seventh confirmed anomalous X-ray pulsar,the eleventh
confirmed magnetar, and the first magnetar to be identified in the Small
Magellanic Cloud.",2005-04-15T22:07:51Z
"Critical Examinations of QSO Redshift Periodicities and Associations
  with Galaxies in Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data","We have used the publicly available data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
and 2dF QSO Redshift Survey to test the hypothesis that QSOs are ejected from
active galaxies with periodic non-cosmological redshifts. For two different
intrinsic redshift models, namely the Karlsson $\log(1+z)$ model and Bell's
decreasing intrinsic redshift (DIR) model, we do two tests respectively. First,
using different criteria, we generate four sets of QSO-galaxy pairs and find
there is no evidence for a periodicity at the predicted frequency in
$\log(1+z)$, or at any other frequency. We then check the relationship between
high redshift QSOs and nearby active galaxies, and we find the distribution of
projected distance between high redshift QSOs and nearby active galaxies and
the distribution of redshifts of those active galaxies are consistent with a
distribution of simulated random pairs, completely different from Bell's
previous conclusion. We also analyze the periodicity in redshifts of QSOs, and
no periodicity is found in high completeness samples, contrary to the DIR
model. These results support that QSOs are not ejected from active galaxies.",2005-06-16T04:13:13Z
Cosmological constrains from X-ray AGN clustering and SNIa data,"We put constraints on the main cosmological parameters of different spatially
flat cosmological models by combining the recent clustering results of
XMM-Newton soft (0.5-2 keV) X-ray sources, which have a redshift distribution
with median redshift $z\sim 1.2$, and SNIa data. Using a likelihood procedure
we find that the model which best reproduces the observational data and that is
consistent with stellar ages is the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model with:
$\Omega_{\rm m}\simeq 0.28$, $w\simeq -1$, $H_{\circ} \simeq 72$ km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$, $t_{\circ}\simeq 13.5$Gyr and has an X-ray AGN clustering evolution
which is constant in physical coordinates. For a different clustering evolution
model (constant in comoving coordinates) we find another viable model, although
less probable due to the smaller age of the Universe, with $\Omega_{\rm
m}\simeq 0.38$, $w\simeq -1.25$, $H_{\circ} \simeq 70$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$,
$t_{\circ}\simeq 12.9$Gyr.",2005-03-11T20:22:29Z
Encounters between spherical galaxies I: systems without dark halo,"We report here on a survey of N-body simulations of encounters between
spherical galaxies. Initial systems are isotropic Jaffe models. Different sets
of mass ratios, impact parameters and orbital energies are studied. Both merger
remnants and systems perturbed after a non-merging encounter are analysed and
compared to real-life elliptical galaxies. The properties of merger remnants
show a large variety. Merger remnants resulting from head-on encounters are
mainly non-rotating prolate spheroids. Merger remnants from models with angular
momentum different from zero are triaxial or mildly oblate spheroids supported
in part by rotation. The velocity distributions are biased towards the radial
direction in the prolate case and the tangential direction in the oblate case.
Non-mergers are affected in various ways, depending on the orbital
characteristics. We conclude that many of the global properties of real-life
ellipticals can in principle be attributed to a merger of spherical
progenitors.",2005-06-01T15:00:46Z
"Electromagnetic waves with negative phase velocity in Schwarzschild-de

(NPV) is considered in Schwarzschild-(anti-)de Sitter spacetime. It is
demonstrated that NPV propagation occurs in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime
at lower values of the cosmological constant than is the case for de Sitter

Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter spacetime, nor is it possible outside the event
horizon of a Schwarzschild blackhole.",2005-03-07T13:04:18Z
Chemical Abundances in SFG and DLA,"We investigate the chemical abundances of local star-forming galaxies which
cause Damped Lyman Alpha lines. A metallicity versus redshift diagram is
constructed, on which the chemical abundances of low-redshift star-forming
galaxy populations are compared with those of high-redshift Damped Lyman Alpha
systems. We disucss two types of experiments on individual star-forming
galaxies. In the first, the Damped Lyman Alpha line is created against an
internal ultraviolet light source generated by a star-forming cluster or a
supernova explosion. In the second, the Damped Lyman Alpha line is seen against
a background Quasar. The metallicities measured from ionized gas in the
star-forming regions, and neutral gas in the Damped Lyman Alpha systems, are
compared with one another on a case-by-case basis. We highlight the occurrence
of the star-forming galaxy/Quasar pair SBS 1543+593/HS 1543+5921, where the
emission- and absorption-line derived abundances give the same result. We argue
that we therefore can in principle, interpret Damped Lyman Alpha system
metallicities as an extension of star-forming galaxy metallicities to higher
redshifts, supporting that gas-rich galaxies had lower chemical abundances when
the were younger.",2005-04-18T14:44:23Z
"Hydrodynamical simulations of the decay of high-speed molecular
  turbulence. II. Divergence from isothermality","A roughly constant temperature over a wide range of densities is maintained
in molecular clouds through radiative heating and cooling. An isothermal
equation of state is therefore frequently employed in molecular cloud
simulations. However, the dynamical processes in molecular clouds include shock
waves, expansion waves, cooling induced collapse and baroclinic vorticity, all
incompatible with the assumption of a purely isothermal flow. Here, we
incorporate an energy equation including all the important heating and cooling
rates and a simple chemical network into simulations of three-dimensional,
hydrodynamic, decaying turbulence. This allows us to test the accuracy of the
isothermal assumption by directly comparing a model run with the modified
energy equation to an isothermal model. We compute an extreme case in which the
initial turbulence is sufficiently strong to dissociate much of the gas and
alter the specific heat ratio. The molecules then reform as the turbulence
weakens. We track the true specific heat ratio as well as its effective value.
We analyse power spectra, vorticity and shock structures, and discuss scaling
laws for decaying turbulence. We derive some limitations to the isothermal
approximation for simulations of the interstellar medium using simple
projection techniques. Overall, even given the extreme conditions, we find that
an isothermal flow provides an adequate physical and observational description
of many properties. The main exceptions revealed here concern behaviour
directly related to the high temperature zones behind the shock waves.",2005-04-22T16:36:33Z
Sidebands to the lower kilohertz QPO in 4U1636-53,"In this Paper we report on further observations of the third and fourth
kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the power spectrum of the
low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) 4U1636-53. These kilohertz QPOs are sidebands to
the lower kilohertz QPO. The upper sideband has a frequency 55.5+-1.7 Hz larger
than that of the contemporaneously measured lower kilohertz QPO. Such a
sideband has now been measured at a significance >6 sigma in the power spectra
of three neutron star LMXBs (4U1636-53, 4U1728-34, and 4U1608-52). We also
confirm the presence of a sideband at a frequency ~55 Hz less than the
frequency of the lower kilohertz QPO. The lower sideband is detected at a 3.5
sigma level, only when the lower kilohertz QPO frequency is between 800 and 850
Hz. In that frequency interval the sidebands are consistent with being
symmetric around the lower kHz QPO frequency. The upper limit to the rms
amplitude of the lower sideband is significant lower than that of the upper
sideband for lower kilohertz QPO frequencies >850 Hz. Symmetric sidebands are
unique to 4U1636-53. This might be explained by the fact that lower kilohertz
QPO frequencies as high as 800-850 Hz are rare for 4U1728-34 and 4U1608-52.
Finally, we also measured a low frequency QPO at a frequency of ~43 Hz when the
lower kilohertz QPO frequency is between 700-850 Hz. A similar low-frequency
QPO is present in the power spectra of the other two systems for which a
sideband has been observed. We briefly discuss the possibility that the
sideband is caused by Lense-Thirring precession.",2005-04-06T11:49:50Z
"Deriving stellar properties from photometry: maximizing information
  content and minimizing biases","I study the importance of the accurate calibration of photometric systems in
order to produce meaningful comparisons between the observed colors +
magnitudes and model SEDs. Possible sources of errors are discussed and two
examples are analyzed. I show that well-calibrated Tycho-2 photometry is stable
and precise enough for such comparisons. On the contrary, the available
calibrations for Johnson UBV photometry yield relative large systematic errors,
which has prompted me to develop a new, more precise calibration. The
advantages of multicolor photometry over the standard single-color + magnitude
diagrams for the derivation of physical properties of stars (elimination of
degeneracies, inclusion of multiple parameters, avoidance of linearizing
approximations, possibility of a more precise treatment of errors) are
discussed through the use of CHORIZOS, a code developed specifically for this
purpose.",2005-06-13T17:39:18Z
X-ray synchrotron emission from supernova remnants,"X-ray synchrotron emission tells us of the highest energy reached by
accelerated electrons. In a few supernova remnants (SN 1006, G347.3-0.5) this
is the dominant form of X-ray radiation, but in most it is superposed to the
dominant thermal emission. Thanks to the spectro-imaging capability of Chandra
and XMM-Newton, X-ray synchrotron emission has now been unambiguously detected
in most young supernova remnants (Cas A, Tycho, Kepler). It arises in a very
thin shell (a few arcsecs) at the blast wave. The thinness of that shell (much
broader in the radio domain) implies that the high energy electrons cool down
very fast behind the shock. The magnetic field that one deduces from that
constraint is more than 100 muG behind the shock.",2005-03-15T09:28:23Z
"Exploring the relativistic regime with Newtonian hydrodynamics: An
  improved effective gravitational potential for supernova simulations","We investigate the possibility to approximate relativistic effects in
hydrodynamical simulations of stellar core collapse and post-bounce evolution
by using a modified gravitational potential in an otherwise standard Newtonian
hydrodynamic code. Different modifications of the effective relativistic
potential introduced by Rampp & Janka (2002) are discussed. Corresponding
hydrostatic solutions are compared with solutions of the TOV equations, and
hydrodynamic simulations with two different codes are compared with fully
relativistic results. One code is applied for one- and two-dimensional
calculations with a simple equation of state, and employs either the modified
effective relativistic potential in a Newtonian framework or solves the general
relativistic field equations under the assumption of the conformal flatness
condition (CFC) for the three-metric. The second code allows for full-scale
supernova runs including a microphysical equation of state and neutrino
transport based on the solution of the Boltzmann equation and its moments
equations. We present prescriptions for the effective relativistic potential
for self-gravitating fluids to be used in Newtonian codes, which produce
excellent agreement with fully relativistic solutions in spherical symmetry,
leading to significant improvements compared to previously published
approximations. Moreover, they also approximate qualitatively well relativistic
solutions for models with rotation.",2005-02-08T11:05:49Z
A possible bright blue SN in the afterglow of GRB 020305,"We report on ground-based and HST(+STIS) imaging of the afterglow and host
galaxy of the Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) of March 5 2002. The GRB occurred in a
R=25.17+/-0.14 galaxy, which apparently is part of an interacting system. The
lightcurve of the optical afterglow shows a rebrightening, or at least a
plateau, 12--16 days after the gamma-ray event. UBVRIK' multi-band imaging of
the afterglow ~12 days after the GRB reveals a blue spectral energy
distribution (SED). The SED is consistent with a power-law with a spectral
index of \beta=-0.63+/-0.16, but there is tentative evidence for deviations
away from a power-law. Unfortunately, a spectroscopic redshift has not been
secured for GRB020305. From the SED we impose a redshift upper limit of z ~<
2.8, hence excluding the pseudo redshift of 4.6 reported for this burst. We
discuss the possibilities for explaining the lightcurve, SED and host galaxy
properties for GRB 020305. The most natural interpretation of the lightcurve
and the SED is an associated supernova (SN). Our data can not precisely
determine the redshift of the GRB. The most favoured explanation is a low
redshift (z~0.2) SN, but a higher redshift (z>0.5) SN can not be excluded. We
also discuss less likely scenarios not based on SNe, like a burst occurring in
a z=2.5 galaxy with an extinction curve similar to that of the Milky Way.",2005-04-03T07:33:48Z
"The Absence of Extra-Tidal Structure in the Sculptor Dwarf Spheroidal
  Galaxy","The results of a wide-field survey of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy
are presented. Our aims were to obtain an accurate map of the outer structure
of Sculptor, and to determine the level of interaction between this system and
the Galaxy. Photometry was obtained in two colours down to the magnitude limits
of V=20 and I=19, covering a 3.1 times 3.1 square deg area centred on Sculptor.
The resulting colour-magnitude data were used as a mask to select candidate
horizontal branch and red giant branch stars for this system. Previous work has
shown that the red horizontal branch (HB) stars are more concentrated than the
blue HB stars. We have determined the radial distributions of these two
populations and show that the overall Sculptor density profile is well
described by a two component model based on a combination of these radial
distributions. Additionally, spectra of the Ca ii triplet region were obtained
for over 700 candidate red giant stars over the 10 square deg region using the
2dF instrument on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. These spectra were used to
remove foreground Galactic stars based on radial velocity and Ca ii triplet
strength. The final list of Sculptor members contained 148 stars, seven of
which are located beyond the nominal tidal radius. Both the photometric and
spectroscopic datasets indicate no significant extra-tidal structure. These
results support at most a mild level of interaction between this system and the
Galaxy, and we have measured an upper mass limit for extra-tidal material to be
2.3 +/- 0.6% of the Sculptor luminous mass. This lack of tidal interaction
indicates that previous velocity dispersion measurements (and hence the amount
of dark matter detected) in this system are not strongly influenced by the
Galactic tidal field.",2005-06-03T02:29:07Z
Magnetic field generation from cosmological perturbations,"In this letter, we discuss generation of magnetic field from cosmological
perturbations. We consider the evolution of three component plasma (electron,
proton and photon) evaluating the collision term between elecrons and photons
up to the second order. The collision term is shown to induce electric current,
which then generate magnetic field. There are three contributions, two of which
can be evaluated from the first-order quantities, while the other one is fluid
vorticity which is purely second order. We estimate the magnitudes of the
former contributions and shows that the amplitude of the produced magnetic
field is about $\sim 10^{-19} {\rm G}$ at 10Mpc comoving scale at the
recombination. Compared to astrophysical and inflationary mechanisms for
seed-field generation, our study suffers from much less ambiguities concerning
unknown physics and/or processes.",2005-02-15T05:43:55Z
Integral Field Spectroscopy of 23 Spiral Bulges,"We have obtained Integral Field Spectroscopy for 23 spiral bulges using
INTEGRAL on the William Herschel Telescope and SPIRAL on the Anglo-Australian
Telescope. This is the first 2D survey directed solely at the bulges of spiral
galaxies. Eleven galaxies of the sample do not have previous measurements of
the stellar velocity dispersion (sigma*). These data are designed to complement
our Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph program for estimating black hole
masses in the range 10^6-10^8M_sun using gas kinematics from nucleated disks.
These observations will serve to derive the stellar dynamical bulge properties
using the traditional Mgb and CaII triplets. We use both Cross Correlation and
Maximum Penalized Likelihood to determine projected sigma* in these systems and
present radial velocity fields, major axis rotation curves, curves of growth
and sigma* fields. Using the Cross Correlation to extract the low order 2D
stellar dynamics we generally see coherent radial rotation and irregular
velocity dispersion fields suggesting that sigma* is a non-trivial parameter to
estimate.",2005-04-29T12:57:55Z
Dynamics of dense star-gas systems: BHs and their precursors,"This thesis embraces several aspects of theoretical stellar dynamics in
clusters, both analytically and numerically. We try to elucidate the phenomena
currently observed in all types of galaxies, including AGNs and quasars, some
of the most powerful objects in the universe. The interactions between the
stellar system and the central black hole give rise to a lot of interesting
phenomena. The scheme we employ enables a study of clean-cut aspects without
any noise that particle methods suffer from. We study the most important
physical processes that are readily available in the evolution of a spherical
cluster, like self-gravity, two-body relaxation etc, the interaction with a
central black hole and the role of a mass spectrum. Not only embark we upon
this subject, but we set about an analysis on super-massive stars. How these
stars could power the quasar activity by star accretion and energy flows is one
of the questions that arises. We undertake other questions, such as the
uncertain evolution of such an object and its interaction with the surrounding
stellar system. This is of crucial importance in astrophysics, for these
objects could be regarded as super-massive black holes progenitors.",2005-02-21T15:09:42Z
"Tracking Dark Energy with the ISW effect: short and long-term
  predictions","We present an analysis of the constraining power of future measurements of
the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect on models of the equation of state of
dark energy as a function of redshift, w(z). To achieve this, we employ a new
parameterization of w, which utilizes the mean value of w(z) (<w>) as an
explicit parameter. This helps to separate the information contained in the
estimation of the distance to the last scattering surface (from the CMB) from
the information contained in the ISW effect. We then use Fisher analysis to
forecast the expected uncertainties in the measured parameters from future ISW
observations for two models of dark energy with very different time evolution
properties. For example, we demonstrate that the cross-correlation of Planck
CMB data and LSST galaxy catalogs will provide competitive constraints on w(z),
compared to a SNAP-like SNe project, for models of dark energy with a rapidly
changing equation of state (e.g. 'Kink' models). Our work confirms that, while
SNe measurements are more suitable for constraining variations in w(z) at low
redshift, the ISW effect can provide important independent constraints on w(z)
at high z.",2005-06-16T20:00:17Z
Radio-loud flares from microquasars and radio-loudness of quasars,"The low-frequency power spectra of the X-ray and radio emission from four
microquasars suggest that two distinct modes of energy output are at work: (i)
the `coupled' mode in which the X-ray and radio luminosities are closely
coupled and vary only weakly, and (ii) the `flaring' mode, which dramatically
boosts the radio luminosity but makes no impact on the X-ray luminosity. The
systems are in the flaring mode only a few percent of the time. However, flares
completely dominate the power spectrum of radio emission, with the consequence
that sources in which the flaring mode occurs, such as GRS 1915+105 and Cyg
X-3, have radio power spectra that lie more than an order of magnitude above
the corresponding X-ray power spectra. Of the four microquasars for which we
have examined data, in only one, Cyg X-1, is the flaring mode seemingly
inactive. While Cyg X-1 is a black-hole candidate, one of the three flaring
sources, Sco X-1, is a neutron star. Consequently, it is likely that both modes
are driven by the accretion disk rather than black-hole spin. Radio imaging
strongly suggests that the flaring mode involves relativistic jets. A typical
microquasar is in the flaring mode a few percent of the time, which is similar
to the fraction of quasars that are radio loud. Thus there may be no essential
difference between radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars; radio loudness may
simply be a function of the epoch at which the source is observed.",2005-05-13T11:39:32Z
"The ""Solar Model Problem"" Solved by the Abundance of Neon in Stars of
  the Local Cosmos","The interior structure of the Sun can be studied with great accuracy using
observations of its oscillations, similar to seismology of the Earth. Precise
agreement between helioseismological measurements and predictions of
theoretical solar models has been a triumph of modern astrophysics (Bahcall et
al. 2005). However, a recent downward revision by 25-35% of the solar
abundances of light elements such as C, N, O and Ne (Asplund et al. 2004) has
broken this accordance: models adopting the new abundances incorrectly predict
the depth of the convection zone, the depth profiles of sound speed and
density, and the helium abundance (Basu Antia 2004, Bahcall et al. 2005). The
discrepancies are far beyond the uncertainties in either the data or the model
predictions (Bahcall et al. 2005b). Here we report on neon abundances relative
to oxygen measured in a sample of nearby solar-like stars from their X-ray
spectra. They are all very similar and substantially larger than the recently
revised solar value. The neon abundance in the Sun is quite poorly determined.
If the Ne/O abundance in these stars is adopted for the Sun the models are
brought back into agreement with helioseismology measurements (Antia Basu 2005,
Bahcall et al. 2005c).",2005-06-08T20:03:49Z
Speckle observations of binary stars with a 0.5 m telescope,"We present 36 observations of 17 visual binaries of moderate separation
(range from 0.15'' to 0.79'') made with the 50 cm Cassegrain telescope of the
Jagiellonian University in Cracow. The speckle interferometry technique was
combined with modest optical hardware and a standard photometric CCD camera. We
used broad-band V,R,I filters without a Risley prism to reduce differential
colour refraction, so we performed model analysis to investigate the influence
of this effect on the results of measurements. For binary components of
spectral type O-F, the difference of three spectral classes between them should
bias their relative positions by no more than a couple of tens of
milliarcseconds (mas) for moderate zenith distances. The statistical analysis
of our results confirmed this conclusion. A cross-spectrum approach was applied
to resolve the quadrant ambiguity. Our separations have RMS deviations of
0.012'' and our position angles have RMS deviations of 1.8 deg. Relative
photometry in V, R and I filters appeared to be the less accurately determined
parameter. We discuss our errors in detail and compare them to other speckle
data. This comparison clearly shows the high value of our measurements. We also
present an example of the enhancement of image resolution for an extended
object of angular size greater than the atmospheric coherence patch using
speckle interferometry techniques.",2005-06-08T13:23:35Z
"An Automated Method for the Detection and Extraction of HI
  Self-Absorption in High-Resolution 21cm Line Surveys","We describe algorithms that detect 21cm line HI self-absorption (HISA) in
large data sets and extract it for analysis. Our search method identifies HISA
as spatially and spectrally confined dark HI features that appear as negative
residuals after removing larger-scale emission components with a modified CLEAN
algorithm. Adjacent HISA volume-pixels (voxels) are grouped into features in
(l,b,v) space, and the HI brightness of voxels outside the 3-D feature
boundaries is smoothly interpolated to estimate the absorption amplitude and
the unabsorbed HI emission brightness. The reliability and completeness of our
HISA detection scheme have been tested extensively with model data. We detect
most features over a wide range of sizes, linewidths, amplitudes, and
background levels, with poor detection only where the absorption brightness
temperature amplitude is weak, the absorption scale approaches that of the
correlated noise, or the background level is too faint for HISA to be
distinguished reliably from emission gaps. False detection rates are very low
in all parts of the parameter space except at sizes and amplitudes approaching
those of noise fluctuations. Absorption measurement biases introduced by the
method are generally small and appear to arise from cases of incomplete HISA
detection. This paper is the third in a series examining HISA at high angular
resolution. A companion paper (Paper II) uses our HISA search and extraction
method to investigate the cold atomic gas distribution in the Canadian Galactic
Plane Survey.",2005-03-05T00:22:47Z
Gl86B: a white dwarf orbits an exoplanet host star,"In this letter we present our first high contrast NACO/SDI observations of
the exoplanet host star Gl86 and results from NACO spectroscopy. Els et al.
(2001) found a faint co-moving companion located only ~2arcsec east of the
exoplanet host star Gl86A. Our high contrast SDI observations rule out
additional stellar companions from 1AU up to 23AU, and are sensitive for faint
T dwarf companions down to 35MJup. We present evidence for orbital motion of
Gl86B around the exoplanet host star Gl86A, which finally confirms that this is
a bound binary system. With the given photometry from Els et al. (2001) and the
obtained NACO spectroscopy we prove that the companion Gl86B is a cool white
dwarf with an effective temperature of 5000+-500K. This is the first confirmed
white dwarf companion to an exoplanet host star and the first observational
confirmation that planets survive the post main sequence evolution of a star
from which they are separated by only one to two dozen astronomical units
(giant phase and planetary nebula) as expected from theory.",2005-06-14T15:48:00Z
Massive young clusters in the disc of M31,"We have studied the properties of a sample of 67 very blue and likely young
massive clusters in M31 extracted from the Bologna Revised Catalog of globular
clusters, selected according to their color [(B-V) < 0.45] and/or to the
strength of their Hbeta spectral index (Hbeta > 3.5 A). Their existence in M31
has been noted by several authors in the past; we show here that these Blue
Luminous Compact Clusters (BLCCs) are a significant fraction (>~ 15%) of the
whole globular cluster system of M31. Compared to the global properties of the
M31 globular cluster system, they appear to be intrinsically fainter,
morphologically less concentrated, and with a shallower Balmer jump and
enhanced $H\beta$ absorption in their spectra.
  Empirical comparison with integrated properties of clusters with known age as
well as with theoretical SSP models consistently indicate that their typical
age is less than ~2 Gyr, while they probably are not so metal-poor as deduced
if considered to be old. Either selecting BLCCs by their (B-V) colors or by the
strength of their Hbeta index the cluster sample turns out to be distributed
onto the outskirts of M31 disc, sharing the kinematical properties of the thin,
rapidly rotating disc component.
  If confirmed to be young and not metal-poor, these clusters indicate the
occurrence of a significant recent star formation in the thin disc of M31,
although they do not set constraints on the epoch of its early formation.",2005-03-08T16:14:43Z
"Statistics of phase correlations as a test for non-Gaussianity of the
  CMB maps","Gaussianity is the very base for derivation of the cosmological parameters
from the CMB angular power spectrum. Non-Gaussian signal, whether originated
from experimental error or primordial source, could mimic extra power in the
power spectrum, thereby leading to a wrong set of parameters. In this paper we
present a new Gaussianity analysis of the derived CMB singals. It is based on
the trigonometric moments of phases, which can be concluded with a ``mean
angle'', allowing us to see the global trend of non-Gaussianity of the signals.
These moments are also closely related to the Pearson's random walks. We apply
these analyses on the derived CMB maps and their different morphologies
manifest themselves through these functions. We also comment on rotational
invariance of the trigonometric moments of phases as a non-Gaussianity test.",2005-05-01T17:56:09Z
"Global MHD Modelling of the ISM - From large towards small scale
  turbulence","Dealing numerically with the turbulent nature and non-linearity of the
physical processes involved in the ISM requires the use of sophisticated
numerical schemes coupled to HD and MHD mathematical models. SNe are the main
drivers of the interstellar turbulence by transferring kinetic energy into the
system. This energy is dissipated by shocks (which is more efficient) and by
molecular viscosity. We carried out adaptive mesh refinement simulations (with
a finest resolution of 0.625 pc) of the turbulent ISM embedded in a magnetic
field with mean field components of 2 and 3 $\mu$G. The time scale of our run
was 400 Myr, sufficiently long to avoid memory effects of the initial setup,
and to allow for a global dynamical equilibrium to be reached in case of a
constant energy input rate. It is found that the longitudinal and transverse
turbulent length scales have a time averaged (over a period of 50 Myr) ratio of
0.52-0.6, almost similar to the one expected for isotropic homogeneous
turbulence. The mean characteristic size of the larger eddies is found to be
\~75 pc in both runs. In order to check the simulations against observations,
we monitored the OVI and HI column densities within a superbubble created by
the explosions of 19 SNe having masses and velocities of the stars that
exploded in vicinity of the Sun generating the Local Bubble. The model
reproduces the FUSE absorption measurements towards 25 white dwarfs of the \ovi
column density as function of distance and of \nhi. In particular for lines of
sight with lengths smaller than 120 pc it is found that there is no correlation
between N(OVI) and N(HI).",2005-05-04T12:34:18Z
Once-ionized helium in superstrong magnetic fields,"It is generally believed that magnetic fields of some neutron stars, the
so-called magnetars, are enormously strong, up to 10^{14} - 10^{15} G. Recent
investigations have shown that the atmospheres of magnetars are possibly
composed of helium. We calculate the structure and bound-bound radiative
transitions of the He^+ ion in superstrong fields, including the effects caused
by the coupling of the ion's internal degrees of freedom to its center-of-mass
motion. We show that He^+ in superstrong magnetic fields can produce spectral
lines with energies of up to about 3 keV, and it may be responsible for
absorption features detected recently in the soft X-ray spectra of several
radio-quiet isolated neutron stars. Quantization of the ion's motion across a
magnetic field results in a fine structure of spectral lines, with a typical
spacing of tens electron-volts in magnetar-scale fields. It also gives rise to
ion cyclotron transitions, whose energies and oscillator strengths depend on
the state of the bound ion.",2005-05-23T00:04:38Z
A Search for Unresolved Double Degenerates Using IUE Archives,"We present preliminary results of a study aimed at detecting double white
dwarf systems using a method based on a comparison of optical and UV spectra
for 141 DA stars drawn from the IUE archives. In particular, we are looking for
dicrepancies between optical and UV temperatures. Even though known unresolved
degenerate binaries stand out in this comparison, most temperature differences
can probably be attributed to the presence of reddening, or the presence of
heavy elements. We are in the process of securing additional optical
spectroscopic observations to increase the number of stars in our analysis.",2005-03-08T18:27:57Z
Detection of cosmic neutrino clustering by cosmic ray spectra,"We propose a method to investigate the scenario that cosmic relic neutrinos
are highly clustered around stars and galaxies, or dark-matter clusters, rather
than uniformly distributed in the universe. Such a scenario can be detected or
constrained by the interaction of high energy cosmic ray protons and nuclei
with the cosmic neutrinos. There should be observable signature in the energy
spectra of cosmic ray protons and nuclei for a neutrino clustering factor
beyond $10^{13}$. We provide a relation on the signature onset positions
between proton and nuclei spectra, and discuss possible support from existing
experiments. It is also suggested that the relative abundance of cosmic ray
nuclei may detect or constrain the cosmic neutrinos with smaller clustering.",2005-02-18T15:52:44Z
The Origin of UCDs in the Virgo Cluster,"We present the internal velocity dispersions and spectral line indices for
six Virgo ultra-compact dwarf (UCD) galaxies obtained from spectroscopy with
the Keck II 10-m telescope. We use these results: 1) to compare the Virgo UCDs
with the Fornax UCD population; 2) to compare UCDs with globular clusters (GCs)
to determine if UCDs and the most luminous GCs are the same or distinct
systems; 3) to further test the nucleated dwarf elliptical (dE,N) stripping
hypothesis for UCD formation.",2005-04-13T07:30:38Z
Kiso observations for 20 GRBs in HETE-2 era,"We have established a GRB follow-up observation system at Kiso observatory
(Japan) in 2001. Since the east Asian area had been blank for the GRB follow-up
observational network, this observational system is very important in studying
the temporal and spectral evolution of early afterglows. Using this system, we
have performed quick observations for optical afterglows from early phase based
on HETE-2 and INTEGRAL alerts. Thanks to the quick follow-up observation
system, we have been able to use the Kiso observatory in 20 events, and conduct
their follow-up observations in optical and near infrared wavelengths.",2005-06-10T12:47:08Z
"FIRST-based survey of Compact Steep Spectrum sources, II. MERLIN and VLA
  observations of Medium-sized Symmetric Objects","A new sample of candidate Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) sources that are much
weaker than the CSS source prototypes has been selected from the VLA FIRST
catalogue. MERLIN `snapshot' observations of the sources at 5 GHz indicate that
six of them have an FR II-like morphology, but are not edge-brightened as is
normal for Medium-sized Symmetric Objects (MSOs) and FR IIs. Further
observations of these six sources with the VLA at 4.9 GHz and MERLIN at 1.7
GHz, as well as subsequent full-track observations with MERLIN at 5 GHz of what
appeared to be the two sources of greatest interest are presented. The results
are discussed with reference to the established evolutionary model of CSS
sources being young but in which not all of them evolve to become old objects
with extended radio structures. A lack of stable fuelling in some of them may
result in an early transition to a so-called coasting phase so that they fade
away instead of growing to become large-scale objects. It is possible that one
of the six sources (1542+323) could be labelled as a prematurely `dying' MSO or
a `fader'.",2005-05-20T11:33:57Z
Habitable Zones in the Universe,"Habitability varies dramatically with location and time in the universe. This
was recognized centuries ago, but it was only in the last few decades that
astronomers began to systematize the study of habitability. The introduction of
the concept of the habitable zone was key to progress in this area. The
habitable zone concept was first applied to the space around a star, now called
the Circumstellar Habitable Zone. Recently, other, vastly broader, habitable
zones have been proposed. We review the historical development of the concept
of habitable zones and the present state of the research. We also suggest ways
to make progress on each of the habitable zones and to unify them into a single
concept encompassing the entire universe.",2005-03-14T17:18:13Z
Constraining the properties of spots on Pleiades very low mass stars,"We present results of a multi-filter monitoring campaign for very low mass
(VLM) stars in the Pleiades. Simultaneous to our I-band time series (Scholz &
Eisloeffel 2004), which delivered photometric periods for nine VLM stars, we
obtained light curves in the J- and H-band. One VLM star with M~0.15 Ms
(BPL129) shows a period in all three wavelength bands. The amplitudes in I, J,
and H are 0.035, 0.035, and 0.032 mag. These values are compared to
simulations, in which we compute the photometric amplitude as a function of
spot temperature and filling factor. The best agreement between observations
and models is found for cool spots with a temperature contrast of 18-31% and a
very low surface filling factor of 4-5%. We suggest that compared to more
massive stars VLM objects may have either very few spots or a rather symmetric
spot distribution. This difference might be explained with a change from a
shell to a distributed dynamo in the VLM regime.",2005-05-27T18:41:23Z
"The Piecewise Parabolic Method for Multidimensional Relativistic Fluid
  Dynamics","We present an extension of the Piecewise Parabolic Method to special
relativistic fluid dynamics in multidimensions. The scheme is conservative,
dimensionally unsplit, and suitable for a general equation of state. Temporal
evolution is second-order accurate and employs characteristic projection
operators; spatial interpolation is piece-wise parabolic making the scheme
third-order accurate in smooth regions of the flow away from discontinuities.
The algorithm is written for a general system of orthogonal curvilinear
coordinates and can be used for computations in non-cartesian geometries. A
non-linear iterative Riemann solver based on the two-shock approximation is
used in flux calculation. In this approximation, an initial discontinuity
decays into a set of discontinuous waves only implying that, in particular,
rarefaction waves are treated as flow discontinuities. We also present a new
and simple equation of state which approximates the exact result for the
relativistic perfect gas with high accuracy. The strength of the new method is
demonstrated in a series of numerical tests and more complex simulations in
one, two and three dimensions.",2005-05-10T16:30:05Z
"On the effective particle acceleration in the paraboloidal magnetic
  field","The problem of the efficiency of particle acceleration for parabolic poloidal
magnetic field is considered within the approach of steady axisymmetric MHD
flow. For the large Michel magnetization parameter it is possible to linearize
the stream equation near the force-free solution and to solve the problem
self-consistently as was done by Beskin, Kuznetsova and Rafikov (1998) for
monopole magnetic field. It is shown that on the fast magnetosonic surface the
particle Lorentz factor does not exceed the standard value. On the other hand,
in the supersonic region the Lorentz factor grows linearly with the distance
from the rotational axis, reaching almost its maximal value. This corresponds
to almost the full conversion of the Poynting energy flux into the particle
kinetic one.",2005-06-15T05:38:52Z
"The magnetic field of the Large Magellanic Cloud revealed through
  Faraday rotation","We have measured the Faraday rotation toward a large sample of polarized
radio sources behind the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), to determine the
structure of this galaxy's magnetic field. The magnetic field of the LMC
consists of a coherent axisymmetric spiral of field strength ~1 microgauss.
Strong fluctuations in the magnetic field are also seen, on small (<0.5
parsecs) and large (~100 parsecs) scales. The significant bursts of recent star
formation and supernova activity in the LMC argue against standard dynamo
theory, adding to the growing evidence for rapid field amplification in
galaxies.",2005-03-09T21:00:02Z
"X-ray Lighthouses of the High-Redshift Universe. II. Further Snapshot
  Observations of the Most Luminous z>4 Quasars with Chandra","We report on Chandra observations of a sample of 11 optically luminous
(Mb<-28.5) quasars at z=3.96-4.55 selected from the Palomar Digital Sky Survey
and the Automatic Plate Measuring Facility Survey. These are among the most
luminous z>4 quasars known and hence represent ideal witnesses of the end of
the ""dark age ''. Nine quasars are detected by Chandra, with ~2-57 counts in
the observed 0.5-8 keV band. These detections increase the number of X-ray
detected AGN at z>4 to ~90; overall, Chandra has detected ~85% of the
high-redshift quasars observed with snapshot (few kilosecond) observations. PSS
1506+5220, one of the two X-ray undetected quasars, displays a number of
notable features in its rest-frame ultraviolet spectrum, the most prominent
being broad, deep SiIV and CIV absorption lines. The average optical-to-X-ray
spectral index for the present sample (<alpha_ox>=-1.88+/-0.05) is steeper than
that typically found for z>4 quasars but consistent with the expected value
from the known dependence of this spectral index on quasar luminosity.
  We present joint X-ray spectral fitting for a sample of 48 radio-quiet
quasars in the redshift range 3.99-6.28 for which Chandra observations are
available. The X-ray spectrum (~870 counts) is well parameterized by a power
law with Gamma=1.93+0.10/-0.09 in the rest-frame ~2-40 keV band, and a tight
upper limit of N_H~5x10^21 cm^-2 is obtained on any average intrinsic X-ray
absorption. There is no indication of any significant evolution in the X-ray
properties of quasars between redshifts zero and six, suggesting that the
physical processes of accretion onto massive black holes have not changed over
the bulk of cosmic time.",2005-03-14T21:00:09Z
"Mapping the Physical Properties of Cosmic Hot Gas with Hyper-spectral
  Imaging","A novel inversion technique is proposed to compute parametric maps showing
the temperature, density and chemical composition of cosmic hot gas from X-ray
hyper-spectral images. The parameters are recovered by constructing a unique
non-linear mapping derived by combining a physics-based modelling of the X-ray
spectrum with the selection of optimal bandpass filters. Preliminary results
and analysis are presented.",2005-05-09T10:18:07Z
The case for a distributed solar dynamo shaped by near-surface shear,"Arguments for and against the widely accepted picture of a solar dynamo being
seated in the tachocline are reviewed and alternative ideas concerning dynamos
operating in the bulk of the convection zone, or perhaps even in the
near-surface shear layer, are discussed. Based on the angular velocities of
magnetic tracers it is argued that the observations are compatible with a
distributed dynamo that may be strongly shaped by the near-surface shear layer.
Direct simulations of dynamo action in a slab with turbulence and shear are
presented to discuss filling factor and tilt angles of bipolar regions in such
a model.",2005-02-15T20:34:13Z
"The very early optical afterglow of GRBs, revealing the nature of the
  ejecta","We show that if the GRB ejecta itself is magnetized or neutron-rich, the very
early afterglow of GRBs is very different from that powered by a pure ion
fireball. In the Swift era, with the well monitored early afterglow data, we
can potentially diagnose the ejecta composition and reveal the nature of the
central GRB engine.",2005-03-08T20:17:17Z
"Tracing large-scale structure at high redshift with Lyman-alpha
  emitters: the effect of peculiar velocities","We investigate the effect of peculiar velocities on the redshift space
distribution of z>~2 galaxies, and we focus in particular on Ly-alpha emitters.
We generate catalogues of dark matter (DM) halos and identify emitters with
halos of the same co-moving space density (M(Ly-alpha emitters) ~ 3x10^11
M_sun). We decompose the peculiar velocity field of halos into streaming,
gradient and random components, and compute and analyse these as a function of
scale. Streaming velocities are determined by fluctuations on very large
scales, strongly affected by sample variance, but have a modest impact on the
interpretation of observations. Gradient velocities are the most important as
they distort structures in redshift space, changing the thickness and
orientation of sheets and filaments. Random velocities are typically below or
of the same order as the typical observational uncertainty on the redshift. We
discuss the importance of these effects for the interpretation of data on the
large-scale structure as traced by Ly-alpha emitters (or similar kinds of
astrophysical high-redshift objects), focusing on the induced errors in the
viewing angles of filaments. We compare our predictions of velocity patterns
for Ly-alpha emitters to observations and find that redshift clumping of
Ly-alpha emitters, as reported for instance in the fields of high-redshift
radio galaxies, does not allow to infer whether an observed field is sampling
an early galaxy overdensity.",2005-05-23T16:05:35Z
"""4n multipole periodicity"" of the Galaxy image in the WMAP data","We present a specific periodicity of the Galaxy images in the multipole
domain which can be used for separation of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) signal from the Galaxy and foreground component.
  This method takes into consideration all the coefficients of the expansion of
the signal from the sky \Delta T(\Theta, \phi) into spherical harmonics and
dealing with combination of multipoles a_{l,m} and a_{l+\Delta,m} for each
multipole mode (\ell, -\ell \le m \le \ell) from the whole sky without galactic
cut, masks or any dissection of the whole sky into disjoint regions. For the
polar coordinate system we use particular values for \Delta=4n, n=1,2,... which
remove all bright point-like sources localized in the Galactic plane and strong
diffused component down to the CMB level. To illustrate that significant
correlations of the point like sources and foregrounds a_{l,m},a_{l+\Delta,m}
coefficients we apply this method to the WMAP Q,V and W bands in order to
remove these marks of Galaxy from the maps. We believe that our method would be
useful for separation of the CMB signal from different kind of ""noises"" in the
maps.",2005-03-01T11:21:32Z
One-armed Spiral Instability in a Low T/|W| Postbounce Supernova Core,"A three-dimensional, Newtonian hydrodynamic technique is used to follow the
postbounce phase of a stellar core collapse event. For realistic initial data
we have employed post core-bounce snapshots of the iron core of a 20 solar mass
star. The models exhibit strong differential rotation but have centrally
condensed density stratifications. We demonstrate for the first time that such
postbounce cores are subject to a so-called low-T/|W| nonaxisymmetric
instability and, in particular, can become dynamically unstable to an m=1 -
dominated spiral mode at T/|W| ~ 0.08. We calculate the gravitational wave
emission by the instability and find that the emitted waves may be detectable
by current and future GW observatories from anywhere in the Milky Way.",2005-03-08T16:10:09Z
The Tully-Fisher relation of distant cluster galaxies,"We have measured maximum rotation velocities (Vrot) for a sample of 111
emission-line galaxies with 0.1 < z < 1, observed in the fields of 6 clusters.
  From these data we construct 'matched' samples of 58 field and 22 cluster
galaxies, covering similar ranges in redshift (0.25 < z < 1.0) and luminosity
(M_B < -19.5 mag), and selected in a homogeneous manner. We find the
distributions of M_B, Vrot, and scalelength, to be very similar for the two
samples. However, using the Tully-Fisher relation (TFR) we find that cluster
galaxies are systematically offset with respect to the field sample by
-0.7+-0.2 mag. This offset is significant at 3 sigma and persists when we
account for an evolution of the field TFR with redshift. Extensive tests are
performed to investigate potential differences between the measured emission
lines and derived rotation curves of the cluster and field samples. However, no
such differences which could affect the derived Vrot values and account for the
offset are found. The most likely explanation for the TFR offset is that giant
spiral galaxies in distant clusters are on average brighter, for a given
rotation velocity, than those in the field. We discuss the potential mechanisms
responsible for this, and consider alternative explanations.",2005-03-30T13:44:39Z
Star formation rates and mass distributions in interacting galaxies,"We present a systematic investigation of the star formation rate (hereafter
SFR) in interacting disk galaxies. We determine the dependence of the overall
SFR on different spatial alignments and impact parameters of more than 50
different configurations in combined N-body/hydrodynamic simulations. We also
show mass profiles of the baryonic components. We find that galaxy-galaxy
interactions can enrich the surrounding intergalatic medium with metals very
efficiently up to distances of several 100 kpc. This enrichment can be
explained in terms of indirect processes like thermal driven galactic winds or
direct processes like 'kinetic' spreading of baryonic matter. In the case of
equal mass mergers the direct -kinetic- redistribution of gaseous matter (after
5 Gyr) is less efficient than the environmental enrichment of the same isolated
galaxies by a galactic wind. In the case of non-equal mass mergers however, the
direct -kinetic- process dominates the redistribution of gaseous matter.
Compared to the isolated systems, the integrated star formation rates (ISFRs)
($\int_{t = 0 Gyr}^{t = 5 Gyr}\textnormal{SFR(t)}dt$) in the modelled
interacting galaxies are in extreme cases a factor of 5 higher and on average a
factor of 2 higher in interacting galaxies. Co-rotating and counter-rotating
interactions do not show a common trend for the enhancement of the ISFRs
depending on the interaction being edge-on or face-on. The latter case shows an
increase of the ISFRs for the counter-rotating system of about 100%, whereas
the edge-on counter-rotating case results in a lower increase ($\sim$ 10%).",2005-03-25T09:57:30Z
"Measurement of Spectral Breaks in Pulsar Wind Nebulae with
  Millimeter-wave Interferometry","We have observed pulsar wind nebulae in the three supernova remnants
G11.2-0.3, G16.7+0.1, and G29.7-0.3 at 89 GHz with the
Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association Array, measuring total flux densities of
two of them for comparison with archival data at other frequencies . In
G16.7+0.1, we find a break in the spectrum of the PWN at ~26 GHz. In G29.7-0.3,
our data suggest a break in the integrated spectrum of the central nebula at
~55 GHz, lower than previously estimated. However, we have found spatial
structure in the spectrum of this nebula. The emission to the north of pulsar
J1846-0258 has a broken spectrum, with break frequency ~< 100 GHz, consistent
with a conventional pulsar-powered nebula. The emission to the south of the
pulsar has a near-power-law spectrum from radio to X-rays: this component may
be unrelated to the PWN, or may be evidence of asymmetries and/or time
evolution in the pulsar's energy output. We present 89 GHz images of each
remnant.",2005-02-19T02:38:49Z
"The role of General Relativity in the evolution of Low Mass X-ray
  Binaries","We study the evolution of Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) and of millisecond
binary radio pulsars (MSPs), with numerical simulations that keep into account
the evolution of the companion, of the binary system and of the neutron star.
According to general relativity, when energy is released, the system loses
gravitational mass. Moreover, the neutron star can collapse to a black hole if
its mass exceeds a critical limit, that depends on the equation of state. These
facts have some interesting consequences: 1) In a MSP the mass-energy is lost
with a specific angular momentum that is smaller than the one of the system,
resulting in a positive contribution to the orbital period derivative. If this
contribution is dominant and can be measured, we can extract information about
the moment of inertia of the neutron star, since the energy loss rate depends
on it. Such a measurement can therefore help to put constraints on the equation
of state of ultradense matter. 2) In LMXBs below the bifurcation period (\sim
18 h), the neutron star survives the period gap only if its mass is smaller
than the maximum non-rotating mass when the companion becomes fully convective
and accretion pauses. Therefore short period (P < 2h) millisecond X-ray pulsar
like SAX J1808.4-3658 can be formed only if either a large part of the
accreting matter has been ejected from the system, or the equation of state of
ultradense matter is very stiff. 3) In Low Mass X-ray binaries above the
bifurcation period, the mass-energy loss lowers the mass transfer rate. As side
effect, the inner core of the companion star becomes 1% bigger than in a system
with a non-collapsed primary. Due to this difference, the final orbital period
of the system becomes 20% larger than what is obtained if the mass-energy loss
effect is not taken into account.",2005-02-21T17:25:18Z
"ISO observations of the Wolf-Rayet galaxies NGC 5430, NGC 6764, Mrk 309
  and VII Zw 19","Observations of four WR galaxies (NGC 5430, NGC 6764, Mrk 309 and VII Zw 19)
using the Infrared Space Observatory are presented here. ISOCAM maps of NGC
5430, Mrk 309 and NGC 6764 revealed the location of star formation regions in
each of these galaxies. ISOPHOT spectral observations from 4 to 12 microns
detected the ubiquitous PAH bands in the nuclei of the targets and several of
the disk star forming regions, while LWS spectroscopy detected [OI] and [CII]
emission lines from two galaxies, NGC 5430 and NGC 6764.
  Using a combination of ISO and IRAS flux densities, a dust model based on the
sum of modified blackbody components was successfully fitted to the available
data. These models were then used to calculate new values for the total IR
luminosities for each galaxy, the size of the various dust populations, and the
global SFR.
  The derived flux ratios, the SFRs, the high L(PAH)/L(40-120 microns) and
F(PAH 7.7 microns)/F(7.7 microns continuum) values suggest that most of these
galaxies are home to only a compact burst of star formation. The exception is
NGC 6764, whose F(PAH 7.7 microns)/F(7.7 microns continuum) value of 1.22 is
consistent with the presence of an AGN, yet the L(PAH)/L(40-120 microns) is
more in line with a starburst, a finding in line with a compact low-luminosity
AGN dominated by the starburst.",2005-06-01T21:57:39Z
"GRBs and SGRs by high energy leptons showering in blazing gamma jets:
  are SGRs sources of EeV CRs?","The apparently huge energy budget of the gamma ray burst GRB 990123 led to
the final collapse of the isotropic fireball model, forcing even the most
skeptical to consider a beamed Jet emission correlated to a supernova (SN)
explosion. Similarly the surprising giant flare from the soft gamma repeater
SGR 1806-20 that occurred on 2004 December 27, may induce the crisis of the
magnetar model. If the apparently huge energy associated to this flare has been
radiated isotropically, the magnetar should have consumed at once most of (if
not all) the energy stored in the magnetic field. On the contrary we think that
a thin collimated precessing jet, blazing on-axis, may be the source of such
apparently huge bursts with a moderate output power. We discuss the possible
role of the synchrotron emission and electromagnetic showering of PeV electron
pairs from muon bundles. A jet made of muons may play a key role in avoiding
the opacity of the SN-GRB radiation field. We propose a similar mechanism to
explain the emission of SGRs. In this case we also examine the possibility of a
primary hadronic jet that would produce ultra relativistic e+ e- (1 - 10 PeV)
from pion- muon or neutron decay. Such electron pairs would emit a few hundreds
keV radiation from their interaction with the galactic magnetic field, as it is
observed in the intense gamma ray flare from SGR 1806-20. A thin precessing jet
from a pulsar may naturally explain the negligible variation of the spin
frequency. A correlation between SGR 1806-20, SGR 1900 +14, Cygnus and the
AGASA excess of EeV cosmic rays (CRs) has been found; we suggest that a robust
EeV signal may be detected by AUGER or Milagro in the near future.",2005-04-28T16:20:35Z
"Identification of extragalactic sources of the highest energy EGRET
  photons by correlation analysis","We found significant correlations between the arrival directions of the
highest energy photons (E>10 GeV) observed by EGRET and positions of the BL Lac
type objects (BL Lacs). The observed correlations imply that not less than
three per cent of extragalactic photons at these energies originate from BL
Lacs. Some of the correlating BL Lacs have no counterparts in the EGRET source
catalog, i.e. do not coincide with strong emitters of gamma-rays at lower
energy. The study of correlating BL Lacs suggests that they may form a subset
which is statistically different from the total BL Lac catalog; we argue that
they are prominent candidates for TeV gamma-ray sources. Our results
demonstrate that the analysis of positional correlations is a powerful approach
indispensable in cases when low statistics limits or even prohibits the
standard case-by-case identification.",2005-05-30T12:35:42Z
Multi-frequency Polarization Imaging of Blazars with Cyclic Activity,"Results of multi-frequency VLBA polarization imaging for sources showing

"The luminosity function of Ly-alpha emitters at 2.3 < z < 4.6 from
  integral-field spectroscopy","We have used VIsible MultiObject Spectrograph Integral-Field Unit (VIMOS-IFU)
observations centred on a radio galaxy at z=2.9 to search for Ly-alpha emitters
within a comoving volume of ~ 10^4 Mpc^3. We find 14 Ly-alpha emitters with
flux > 1.4 x 10^-20 Wm^-2, yielding a comoving space density of 0.0018 +/-
0.0006 Mpc^-3. We fit a Schechter luminosity function which agrees well with
previous studies both at similar redshift (z ~ 3.4) and higher redshift (z ~
5.7). We therefore find no evidence for evolution in the properties of Ly-alpha
emitters between 3 < z < 6, although our sample is small. By summing the
star-formation rates of the individual Ly-alpha emitters we find a total cosmic
star-formation rate density of rho_SFR = 6.7 +/- 0.5 x 10^-3 M_solar yr^-1
Mpc^-3. Integrating over the luminosity function for the combined Ly-alpha
surveys at z ~ 3.4 and accounting for the difference in obscuration between the
Ly-alpha line and the UV-continuum yields an estimate of rho_SFR ~ 2.2 x 10^-2
M_solar yr^-1 Mpc^-3, in line with previous multi-colour and narrow-band
surveys of high-redshift star-forming galaxies.
  The detection of high-redshift emission-line galaxies in our volumetric
search shows that the unique capabilities of wide-field integral-field
spectroscopy are well suited in searching for high-redshift galaxies in a
relatively unbiased manner.",2005-02-21T13:24:51Z
Optical identification of IGR J19140+0951,"IGR J19140+0951 was discovered by INTEGRAL in 2003 in the 4-100 keV band.
Observations with INTEGRAL and RXTE provide a tentative identification as a
high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) with a neutron star as accretor. However, an
optical counterpart was thus far not established, nor was the presence of a
pulsar which is commonly observed in HMXBs. We observed IGR J19140+0951 with
Chandra and find the source to be active at a similar flux as previous
measurements. The lightcurve shows a marginally significant oscillation at 6.5
ks which requires confirmation. We determine a sub-arcsecond position from the
Chandra data and identify the heavily reddened optical counterpart 2MASS
19140422+0952577 in the 2MASS catalog. Optical follow-up observations with the
William Herschel Telescope at La Palma exhibit a continuum spectrum coming out
of extinction above 7000 Angstrom without strong absorption or emission
features. V, I and Ks band photometry point to an optical counterpart extincted
by A[V]=11+/-2. The extinction is consistent with the interstellar value. None
of the data reject the suspicion that IGR J19140+0951 is an HMXB with
additional circumstellar obscuration around the accretor.",2005-05-12T13:57:23Z
The stability of buoyant bubbles in the atmospheres of galaxy clusters,"The buoyant rise of hot plasma bubbles inflated by AGN outflows in galaxy
clusters can heat the cluster gas and thereby compensate radiative energy
losses of this material. Numerical simulations of this effect often show the
complete disruption of the bubbles followed by the mixing of the bubble
material with the surrounding cluster gas due to fluid instabilities on the
bubble surface. This prediction is inconsistent with the observations of
apparently coherent bubble structures in clusters. We derive a general
description in the linear regime of the growth of instabilities on the surface
between two fluids under the influence of a gravitational field, viscosity,
surface tension provided by a magnetic field and relative motion of the two
fluids with respect to each other. We demonstrate that Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities are always suppressed, if the fluids are viscous. They are also
suppressed in the inviscid case for fluids of very different mass densities. We
show that the effects of shear viscosity as well as a magnetic fields in the
cluster gas can prevent the growth of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities on relevant
scale lengths. R-T instabilities on pc-scales are suppressed even if the
kinematic viscosity of the cluster gas is reduced by two orders of magnitude
compared to the value given by Spitzer for a fully ionised, unmagnetised gas.
Similarly, magnetic fields exceeding a few microG result in an effective
surface tension preventing the disruption of bubbles. For more massive
clusters, instabilities on the bubble surface grow faster. This may explain the
absence of thermal gas in the north-west bubble observed in the Perseus cluster
compared to the apparently more disrupted bubbles in the Virgo cluster.",2005-02-08T14:32:31Z
"Discovery of Three Wide-orbit Binary Pulsars: Implications for Binary
  Evolution and Equivalence Principles","We report the discovery of three binary millisecond pulsars during the Parkes
Multibeam Pulsar Survey of the Galactic Plane. The objects are highly recycled
and are in orbits of many tens of days about low-mass white-dwarf companions.
The eccentricity of one object, PSR J1853+1303, is more than an order of
magnitude lower than predicted by the theory of convective fluctuations during
tidal circularization. We demonstrate that, under the assumption that the
systems are randomly oriented, current theoretical models of the
core-mass--orbital-period relation for the progenitors of these systems likely
overestimate the white-dwarf masses, strengthening previous concerns about the
match of these models to the data. The new objects allow us to update the
limits on violation of relativistic equivalence principles to 95% confidence
upper limits of 5.6 x 10^-3 for the Strong Equivalence Principle parameter
Delta and 4.0 x 10^-20 for the Lorentz-invariance/momentum-conservation

"Searching for O$_2$ in the SMC:Constraints on Oxygen Chemistry at Low
  Metallicities","We present a 39 h integration with the Odin satellite on the ground-state
118.75 GHz line of O2 towards the region of strongest molecular emission in the
Small Magellanic Cloud. Our 3sigma upper limit to the O2 integrated intensity
of <0.049 K km/s in a 9'(160 pc) diameter beam corresponds to an upper limit on
the O2/H2 abundance ratio of <1.3E-6. Although a factor of 20 above the best
limit on the O2 abundance obtained for a Galactic source, our result has
interesting implications for understanding oxygen chemistry at sub-solar metal
abundances. We compare our abundance limit to a variety of astrochemical models
and find that, at low metallicities, the low O2 abundance is most likely
produced by the effects of photo-dissociation on molecular cloud structure.
Freeze-out of molecules onto dust grains may also be consistent with the
observed abundance limit, although such models have not yet been run at
sub-solar initial metallicities.",2005-02-14T22:09:10Z
"Early photon-shock interaction in stellar wind: sub-GeV photon flash and
  high energy neutrino emission from long GRBs","For gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) born in a stellar wind, as the reverse shock
crosses the ejecta, usually the shocked regions are still precipitated by the
prompt MeV \gamma-ray emission. Because of the tight overlapping of the MeV
photon flow with the shocked regions, the optical depth for the GeV photons
produced in the shocks is very large. These high energy photons are absorbed by
the MeV photon flow and generate relativistic e^\pm pairs. These pairs
re-scatter the soft X-ray photons from the forward shock as well as the prompt
\gamma-ray photons and power detectable high energy emission, significant part
of which is in the sub-GeV energy range. Since the total energy contained in
the forward shock region and the reverse shock region are comparable, the
predicted sub-GeV emission is independent on whether the GRB ejecta are
magnetized (in which case the reverse shock IC and synchrotron self-Compton
emission is suppressed). As a result, a sub-GeV flash is a generic signature
for the GRB wind model, and it should be typically detectable by the future
{\em Gamma-Ray Large Area Telescope} (GLAST). Overlapping also influence
neutrino emission. Besides the 10^{15} \sim 10^{17} eV neutrino emission
powered by the interaction of the shock accelerated protons with the
synchrotron photons in both the forward and reverse shock regions, there comes
another $10^{14}$eV neutrino emission component powered by protons interacting
with the MeV photon flow. This last component has a similar spectrum to the one
generated in the internal shock phase, but the typical energy is slightly
lower.",2005-04-01T21:20:55Z

Compact Stars for Undergraduates,"We report on an undergraduate student project initiated in the summer
semester of 2004 with the aim to establish equations of state for white dwarfs
and neutron stars for computing mass-radius relations as well as corresponding
maximum masses. First, white dwarfs are described by a Fermi gas model of
degenerate electrons and neutrons and effects from general relativity are
examined. For neutron star matter, the influence of a finite fraction of
protons and electrons and of strong nucleon-nucleon interactions are studied.
The nucleon--nucleon interactions are introduced within a Hartree-Fock scheme
using a Skyrme-type interaction. Finally, masses and radii of neutron stars are
computed for given central pressure.",2005-06-17T16:04:27Z
"Discovery of Extremely Embedded X-ray Sources in the R Coronae Australis
  Star Forming Core","With the XMM-Newton and Chandra observatories, we detected two extremely
embedded X-ray sources in the R Corona Australis (R CrA) star forming core,
near IRS 7. These sources, designated as XB and XA, have X-ray absorption
columns of ~3e23 cm-2 equivalent to AV ~180 mag. They are associated with the
VLA centimeter radio sources 10E and 10W, respectively. XA is the counterpart
of the near-infrared source IRS 7, whereas XB has no K-band counterpart above
19.4 mag. This indicates that XB is younger than typical Class I protostars,
probably a Class 0 protostar or in an intermediate phase between Class 0 and
Class I. The X-ray luminosity of XB varied between 29<log LX <31.2 ergs s-1 on
timescales of 3-30 months. XB also showed a monotonic increase in X-ray
brightness by a factor of two in 30 ksec during an XMM-Newton observation. The
XMM-Newton spectra indicate emission from a hot plasma with kT ~3-4 keV and
also show fluorescent emission from cold iron. Though the X-ray spectrum from
XB is similar to flare spectra from Class I protostars in luminosity and
temperature, the light curve does not resemble the lightcurves of magnetically
generated X-ray flares because the variability timescale of XB is too long and
because variations in X-ray count rate were not accompanied by variations in
spectral hardness. The short-term variation of XB may be caused by the partial
blocking of the X-ray plasma, while the month-long flux enhancement may be
driven by mass accretion.",2005-03-02T01:08:25Z
The Star Cluster Population in the Tidal Tails of NGC 6872,"We present a photometric analysis of the rich star cluster population in the
tidal tails of NGC 6872. We find star clusters with ages between 1 - 100 Myr
distributed in the tidal tails, while the tails themselves have an age of less
than 150 Myr. Most of the young massive ($10^{4} \le M/M_{\odot} \le 10^{7}$)
clusters are found in the outer regions of the galactic disk or the tidal
tails. The mass distribution of the cluster population can be well described by
power-law of the form $N(m) \propto m^{-\alpha}$, where $\alpha = 1.85 \pm
0.11$, in very good agreement with other young cluster populations found in a
variety of different environments. We estimate the star formation rate for
three separate regions of the galaxy, and find that the eastern tail is forming
stars at $\sim 2$ times the rate of the western tail and $\sim 5$ times the
rate of the main body of the galaxy. By comparing our observations with
published N-body models of the fate of material in tidal tails in a galaxy
cluster potential, we see that many of these young clusters will be lost into
the intergalactic medium. We speculate that this mechanism may also be at work
in larger galaxy clusters such as Fornax, and suggest that the so-called
ultra-compact dwarf galaxies could be the most massive star clusters that have
formed in the tidal tails of an ancient galactic merger.",2005-02-27T11:51:19Z
Line profiles of molecular ions toward the pre-stellar core LDN 1544,"Velocity profiles of ground state lines of H2D+, HC18O+ and N2H+, observed
previously with the CSO and IRAM 30m telescopes, are modeled with a Monte Carlo
radiative transfer program to study the temperature, density and velocity
structure of the pre-stellar core LDN 1544. The H2D+ line is double-peaked like
that of the other ions, but previous models that fit the HC18O+ and N2H+
profiles are found not to fit the H2D+ data. Matching the H2D+ observations
requires at least three modifications to the model at small radii: (1) the
density profile must continue to rise inward and not flatten off toward the
center; (2) the gas temperature must be nearly constant and not drop inwards
significantly; (3) the infall velocity must increase inward, in a fashion
intermediate between `quasi-static' (ambipolar diffusion) and `fully dynamic'
(Larson-Penston) collapse. The C18O emission indicates a chemical age of <~0.1
Myr. The effects of a flattened structure and rotation on the line profiles are
shown to be unimportant, at least on the scales probed by single-dish
telescopes. Alternatively, the H2D+ profile is affected by absorption in the
outer layers of the core, if gas motions in these layers are sufficiently
small.",2005-05-04T13:45:58Z
Can Cosmic Rays Heat the Intergalactic Medium?,"Supernova explosions in the early star forming galaxies will accelerate
cosmic rays (CRs). CRs are typically confined in the collapsed objects for a
short period before escaping into the intergalactic medium (IGM). Galactic
outflows can facilitate this escape by advecting CRs into the IGM. An outflow
that results in a termination shock can also generate more CRs. We show that
the CR protons from the above processes can significantly affect the thermal
history of the IGM. Within plausible range of parameters, cosmic ray heating
can compensate for adiabatic cooling and explain the measured IGM temperature
at redshifts z between 2 to 4, even with early reionization.",2005-05-30T07:29:42Z
"How To Distinguish Neutron Star and Black Hole X-ray Binaries? Spectral
  index and Quasi-Periodic Oscillation Frequency Correlation","Recent studies have revealed strong correlations between 1-10 Hz frequencies
of quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) and the spectral power law index of
several Black Hole (BH) candidate sources when seen in the low/hard state, the
steep power-law (soft) state, and in transition between these states. In the
soft state these index-QPO frequency correlations show a saturation of the
photon index about 2.7 at high values of the low frequency. This saturation
effect was previously identified as a black hole signature. In this paper we
argue that this saturation does not occur, at least for one neutron star (NS)
source 4U 1728-34, for which the index monotonically increases with the low
frequency to the values of 6 and higher. We base this conclusion on our
analysis about 1.5 Msec of RXTE archival data for 4U 1728-34. We reveal the
spectral evolution of the Comptonized blackbody spectra when the source
transitions from the hard to soft states. The hard state spectrum is a typical
thermal Comptonization spectrum of the soft photons which originate in the disk
and the NS outer photospheric layers. The hard state photon index is about 2.
The soft state spectrum consists of two blackbody components which are only
slightly Comptonized. Thus we can claim (as expected from theory) that in NS
sources thermal equilibrium is established for the soft state. To the contrary
in BH sources, the equilibrium is never established due to the presence of the
BH horizon. The emergent BH spectrum, even in the high/soft state, has a power
law component. We also show that the presence of Fe K_alpha emission-line
strengths, QPOs, and the link between them does not depend on radio flux in 4U
1728-34.",2005-03-03T17:05:56Z
Sh2-188: a model for a speedy PN,"Sh2-188 is thought to be an ancient planetary nebula in the galactic disk. It
appears to be one-sided with recent observations revealing structure behind the
filamentary limb. We postulate that Sh2-188 is interacting with the ISM and
simulate it in terms of a ``triple-wind'' model comprising of the usual
``fast'' and ``slow'' interacting stellar winds plus the wind due to motion
through the ISM. We have run simulations at various velocities of the central
star relative to the ISM and find that a high velocity of 125 km/s best
approximates the observed structure. We also suggest that Sh2-188 is younger
than previously thought and that much of the mass lost on the AGB has been
swept downstream.",2005-06-02T16:46:23Z
Discovery of Pulsed OH Maser Emission Stimulated by a Pulsar,"Stimulated emission of radiation has not been directly observed in
astrophysical situations up to this time. Here we demonstrate that photons from
pulsar B1641-45 stimulate pulses of excess 1720 MHz line emission in an
interstellar OH cloud. As this stimulated emission is driven by the pulsar, it
varies on a few millisecond timescale, orders of magnitude shorter than the
quickest OH maser variations previously detected.
  Our 1612 MHz spectra are inverted copies of the 1720 MHz spectra. This
""conjugate line"" phenomenon enables us to constrain the properties of the
interstellar OH line-producing gas.
  We also show that pulsar signals suffer significantly deeper OH absorption
than do other background sources; confirming earlier tentative findings that OH
clouds are clumpier on small scales than neutral hydrogen clouds.",2005-05-11T13:44:52Z
Constraints on Very High Energy gamma-ray emission from Gamma-Ray Bursts,"The Milagro gamma-ray observatory employs a water Cherenkov detector to
observe extensive air showers produced by high energy particles interacting in
the Earth's atmosphere. Milagro has a wide field of view and high duty cycle,
monitoring the northern sky almost continuously in the 100 GeV to 100 TeV
energy range. Milagro is, thus, uniquely capable of searching for very
high-energy emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) during the prompt emission
phase. Detection of >100 GeV counterparts would place powerful constraints on
GRB mechanisms. Twenty-five satellite-triggered GRBs occurred within the field
of view of Milagro between January 2000 and December 2001. We have searched for
counterparts to these GRBs and found no significant emission from any of the
burst positions. Due to the absorption of high-energy gamma rays by the
extragalactic background light, detections are only expected to be possible for
redshifts less than ~0.5. Three of the GRBs studied have measured redshifts.
GRB 010921 has a redshift low enough (0.45) to allow an upper limit on the
fluence to place an observational constraint on potential GRB models.",2005-03-11T18:49:04Z
The element abundance FIP effect in the quiet Sun,"The Mg/Ne abundance ratio in the quiet Sun is measured in both network and
supergranule cell centre regions through EUV spectra from the Coronal
Diagnostic Spectrometer on SOHO. Twenty four sets of data over the period 1996
March to 1998 June (corresponding to solar minimum) are studied. Emission lines
of the sequences Ne IV-VII and Mg V-VIII are simultaneously analysed by
comparing with theoretical emissivities from the CHIANTI database to yield the
Mg/Ne abundance and emission measure over the temperature region 5.0 < logT <
6.1. The average enhancements over the photospheric Mg/Ne abundance are found
to be 1.25 +/- 0.10 (network) and 1.66 +/- 0.23 (cell centres), significantly
lower than the typical 4-5 enhancements found in the slow solar wind. This
result implies that only a small fraction of the quiet Sun connects into the
solar wind. The quiet Sun spectra are also utilised to determine the coronal
density and temperature, leading to average values of 2.6^+0.5_-0.4 x 10^8
cm^-3 and log (T/K)=5.95 +/- 0.02. No significant trend with the rise in solar
activity during 1996--98 is found for any of the derived quantities, implying
that quiet Sun regions show little dependence on the solar cycle.",2005-03-02T12:09:09Z
The cosmology of the nonsymmetric theory of gravitation,"We show that during cosmological inflation the nonsymmetric metric tensor
theory of gravitation develops a spectrum which is potentially observable by
cosmic microwave background observations, and may be the most sensitive probe
of the scale of cosmic inflation.",2005-03-14T15:50:45Z
"Explicit computation of shear three-point correlation functions: the
  one-halo model case","We present a method for calculating explicit expressions of the shear
three-point function for various cosmological models. The method is applied
here to the one-halo model in case of power law density profiles for which
results are detailed. The three-point functions are found to reproduce to a
large extent patterns in the shear correlations obtained in numerical
simulations and may serve as a guideline to implement optimized methods for
detecting the shear three-point function. In principle, the general method
presented here can also be applied for other models of matter correlation.",2005-05-16T11:59:19Z
"The orbital statistics of stellar inspiral and relaxation near a massive
  black hole: characterizing gravitational wave sources","We study the orbital parameters distribution of stars that are scattered into
nearly radial orbits and then spiral into a massive black hole (MBH) due to
dissipation, in particular by emission of gravitational waves (GW). This is
important for GW detection, e.g. by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
(LISA). Signal identification requires knowledge of the waveforms, which depend
on the orbital parameters. We use analytical and Monte Carlo methods to analyze
the interplay between GW dissipation and scattering in the presence of a mass
sink during the transition from the initial scattering-dominated phase to the
final dissipation-dominated phase of the inspiral. Our main results are (1)
Stars typically enter the GW-emitting phase with high eccentricities. (2) The
GW event rate per galaxy is a few per Gyr for typical central stellar cusps,
almost independently of the relaxation time or the MBH mass. (3) For
intermediate mass black holes (IBHs) of ~a thousand solar masses such as may
exist in dense stellar clusters, the orbits are very eccentric and the inspiral
is rapid, so the sources are very short-lived.",2005-03-30T21:01:04Z
"Sub-milliarcsecond Imaging of Quasars and Active Galactic Nuclei. IV.
  Fine Scale Structure","We have used VLBA fringe visibility data obtained at 15 GHz to examine the
compact structure in 250 extragalactic radio sources. For 171 sources in our
sample, more than half of the total flux density seen by the VLBA remains
unresolved on the longest baselines. There are 163 sources in our list with a
median correlated flux density at 15 GHz in excess of 0.5 Jy on the longest
baselines. For about 60% of the sources, we have at least one observation in
which the core component appears unresolved (generally smaller than 0.05 mas)
in one direction, usually transverse to the direction into which the jet
extends. BL Lacs are on average more compact than quasars, while active
galaxies are on average less compact. Also, in an active galaxy the
sub-milliarcsecond core component tends to be less dominant. IDV sources
typically have a more compact, more core-dominated structure on
sub-milliarcsecond scales than non-IDV sources, and sources with a greater
amplitude of intra-day variations tend to have a greater unresolved VLBA flux
density. The objects known to be GeV gamma-ray loud appear to have a more
compact VLBA structure than the other sources in our sample. This suggests that
the mechanisms for the production of gamma-ray emission and for the generation
of compact radio synchrotron emitting features are related. The brightness
temperature estimates and lower limits for the cores in our sample typically
range between 10^11 and 10^13 K, but they extend up to 5x10^13 K, apparently in
excess of the equipartition brightness temperature, or the inverse Compton
limit for stationary synchrotron sources. The largest component speeds are
observed in radio sources with high observed brightness temperatures, as would
be expected from relativistic beaming (abridged).",2005-05-26T15:55:23Z
Global properties of X-ray afterglows of GRB,"In this paper we review the general properties of X-ray afterglows. We
discuss in particular on the powerful diagnostics provided by X-ray afterglows
in constraining the environment and fireball in normal GRB, and the
implications on the origin of dark GRB and XRF. We also discuss on the observed
properties of the transition from the prompt to the afterglow phase, and
present a case study for a late X-ray outburst interpreted as the onset of the
afterglow stage.",2005-06-01T14:56:23Z
Dark energy and the evolution of spherical overdensities,"We use the non-linear spherical model in cold dark matter (CDM) cosmologies
with dark energy to investigate the effects of dark energy on the growth of
structure and the formation of virialised structures. We consider dark energy
models with a constant equation of state parameter w. For -1<w<-1/3, clusters
form earlier and are more concentrated in quintessence than in LambdaCDM
models, but they form later and are less concentrated than in the corresponding
open model with the same matter density and no dark energy. We point out some
confusion in the literature around the expression of the collapse factor (ratio
of the radius of the sphere at virialisation to that at turn-around) derived
from the virial theorem. We use the Sheth & Tormen extension of the
Press-Schechter framework to calculate the evolution of the cluster abundance
in different models and show the sensitivity of the cluster abundance to both
the amplitude of the mass fluctuations, sigma8, and the sigma8-w normalisation,
selected to match either the cosmic microwave background observations or the
abundance of X-ray clusters.",2005-04-21T12:05:37Z
Galaxy Cluster Assembly at z=0.37,"We present X-ray and spectroscopic confirmation of a cluster assembling from
multiple, distinct galaxy groups at z=0.371. Initially detected in the Las
Campanas Distant Cluster Survey, the structure contains at least four X-ray
detected groups that lie within a maximum projected separation of 4 Mpc and
within dv=550 km/s of one another. Using Chandra imaging and wide-field optical
spectroscopy, we show that the individual groups lie on the local sigma-T
relation, and derive a total mass of M>=5e14 solar masses for the entire
structure. We demonstrate that the groups are gravitationally bound to one
another and will merge into a single cluster with >=1/3 the mass of Coma. We
also find that although the cluster is in the process of forming, the
individual groups already have a higher fraction of passive members than the
field. This result indicates that galaxy evolution on group scales is key to
developing the early-type galaxies that dominate the cluster population by z~0.",2005-03-21T20:45:09Z
Brief history of the metal accumulation in the intracluster medium,"We use models of the rates of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and core-collapse
supernovae, built in such a way that both are consistent with recent
observational constraints at z<1.6 and can reproduce the measured cosmic star
formation rate, to recover the history of the metals accumulation in the
intra-cluster medium. We show that these SN rates, in unit of SN number per
comoving volume and rest-frame year, provide on average a total amount of Iron
that is marginally consistent with the value measured in galaxy clusters in the
redshift range 0-1, and a relative evolution with redshift that is in agreement
with the observational constraints up to z~1.2. Moreover, we verify that the
predicted metals to Iron ratios reproduce the measurements obtained in nearby
clusters through X-ray analysis, implying that (1) about half of the Iron mass
and >75 per cent of the Nickel mass observed locally are produced by SN Ia
ejecta, (2) the SN Ia contribution to the metal budget decreases steeply with
redshift and by z~1 is already less than half of the local amount and (3) a
transition in the abundance ratios relative to the Iron is present between
redshifts ~0.5 and 1.4, with core-collapse SN products becoming dominant at
higher redshifts.",2005-06-13T14:31:24Z
HST and spectroscopic observations of the L1551 IRS5 jets (HH154),"We have carried out a thorough optical study of the closest star formation
jet. The inner arcminute surrounding the class 0/I binary protostar L1551 IRS5
and its associated jet (HH154) have been observed using the Hubble Space
Telescope with the WFPC2 camera, the ESO New Technology Telescope with the EMMI
spectrograph and the Nordic Optical Telescope with the ALFOSC spectrograph.
This data set is compared to earlier ground based imaging with the aim to study
the evolution of this particular jet, and its possible interaction with the
molecular material in the bipolar molecular outflow associated with this
source. The velocity field of the jet is mapped out. The highest velocities are
found in the vicinity of the recently discovered X-ray source emanating from a
shock in this jet. The energy radiated by the X-ray source is compatible with
these velocities. The \halpha and \hbeta emission from the jet is used to
determine the extinction, which is found to increase inwards in the jet towards
the protostar. The extinction towards the X-ray source is consistent with the
one determined from the X-ray spectrum.",2005-03-22T12:16:50Z
Time correlations of high energy muons in an underground detector,"We present the result of a search for correlations in the arrival times of
high energy muons collected from 1995 till 2000 with the streamer tube system
of the complete MACRO detector at the underground Gran Sasso Lab. Large samples
of single muons (8.6 million), double muons (0.46 million) and multiple muons
with multiplicities from 3 to 6 (0.08 million) were selected. These samples
were used to search for time correlations of cosmic ray particles coming from
the whole upper hemisphere or from selected space cones. The results of our
analyses confirm with high statistics a random arrival time distribution of
high energy cosmic rays.",2005-02-12T18:12:56Z
Numeric Spectrum of Relic Gravitational Waves in Accelerating Universe,"The accelerating expansion of the Universe at the present stage is a process
that will change the spectrum of relic gravitational waves. Here we present a
numerical calculation for the power spectrum of relic gravitational waves in
the accelerating Universe. The results show that although the overall features
of the power spectrum is similar to that in the non-accelerating models, the
amplitude is smaller by an order of $10^{-1}$. We also find that the spectrum
is very sensitive to the index $\beta$ of the inflationary expansion with the
scale factor $a(\tau) \propto |\tau|^{1+\beta}$. With increase of $\beta$, the
resulting spectrum is tilted to be flatter with more power on high frequencies,
and the sensitivity of the second science run of the LIGO detectors puts a
restriction on the parameter $\beta < -1.8$. The influence of reheating
following the inflation has been examined.",2005-05-30T05:03:33Z
"Late-epoch optical and near-infrared observations of the GRB000911
  afterglow and its host galaxy","We present the results of an optical and near-infrared (NIR) monitoring
campaign of the counterpart of Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) 000911, located at
redshift z=1.06, from 5 days to more than 13 months after explosion. Our
extensive dataset is a factor of 2 larger and spans a time interval about 4
times longer than the ones considered previously for this GRB afterglow; this
allows a more thorough analysis of its light curve and of the GRB host galaxy
properties. The afterglow light curves show a single power-law temporal
decline, modified at late times by light from a host galaxy with moderate
intrinsic extinction, and possibly by an emerging supernova (SN). The afterglow
evolution is interpreted within the classical ""fireball"" scenario as a weakly
collimated adiabatic shock propagating in the interstellar medium. The presence
of a SN light curve superimposed on the non-thermal afterglow emission is
investigated: while in the optical bands no significant contribution to the
total light is found from a SN, the NIR J-band data show an excess which is
consistent with a SN as bright as the known hypernova SN1998bw. If the SN
interpretation is true, this would be the farthest GRB-associated SN, as well
as the farthest core-collapse SN, discovered to date. However, other possible
explanations of this NIR excess are also investigated. Finally, we studied the
photometric properties of the host, and found that it is likely to be a
slightly reddened, subluminous, extreme starburst compact galaxy, with
luminosity about 0.1 L*, an age of about 0.5 Gyr and a specific Star Formation
Rate (SFR) of approximately 30 Msol yr-1 (L/L*)-1. This is the highest specific
SFR value for a GRB host inferred from optical/NIR data.",2005-04-27T09:39:09Z
A Distinct Structure Inside the Galactic Bar,"We present the result of a near-infrared (J H Ks) survey along the Galactic
plane, -10.5deg < l < +10.5deg and b=+1.0deg, with the IRSF 1.4m telescope and
the SIRIUS camera. Ks vs. H-Ks color-magnitude diagrams reveal a well-defined
population of red clump (RC) stars whose apparent magnitude peak changes
continuously along the Galactic plane, from Ks=13.4 at l=-10deg to Ks=12.2 at
l=+10deg after dereddening. This variation can be explained by the bar-like
structure found in previous studies, but we find an additional inner structure
at |l| < 4deg, where the longitude - apparent magnitude relation is distinct
from the outer bar, and the apparent magnitude peak changes by only 0.1 mag
over the central 8deg. The exact nature of this inner structure is as yet
uncertain.",2005-02-03T14:03:59Z
Discovery of Non-radial pulsations in PQ Andromedae,"We have detected pulsations in time-series photometry of the WZ Sge dwarf
nova PQ And. The strongest peak in the power spectrum occurs at a period of
10.5 minutes. Similar periods have been observed in other WZ Sge systems and
are attributed to ZZ Ceti type non-radial pulsations. There is no indication in
the photometry of an approximately 1.7 hour orbital period as reported in
previous spectroscopic observations.",2005-06-05T00:58:58Z
The Intrinsic Alignment of Dark Halo Substructures,"We investigate the intrinsic alignments of dark halo substructures with their
host halo major-axis orientations both analytically and numerically.
Analytically, we derive the probability density distribution of the angles
between the minor axes of the substructures and the major axes of their host
halos from the physical principles, under the assumption that the substructure
alignment on galaxy scale is a consequence of the tidal fields of the host halo
gravitational potential. Numerically, we use a sample of four cluster-scale
halos and their galaxy-scale substructures from recent high-resolution N-body
simulations to measure the probability density distribution. We compare the
numerical distribution with the analytic prediction, and find that the two
results agree with each other very well. We conclude that our analytic model
provides a quantitative physical explanation for the intrinsic alignment of
dark halo substructures. We also discuss the possibility of discriminating our
model from the anisotropic infall scenario by testing it against very large
N-body simulations in the future.",2005-03-07T03:56:30Z
"Boundary layer emission and Z-track in the color-color diagram of
  luminous LMXBs","We demonstrate that Fourier-frequency resolved spectra of atoll and Z-
sources are identical, despite significant difference in their average spectra
and luminosity (by a factor of ~10-20). This result fits in the picture we
suggested earlier, namely that the f> 1 Hz variability in luminous LMXBs is
primarily due to variations of the boundary layer luminosity. In this picture
the frequency resolved spectrum equals the boundary layer spectrum, which
therefore can be straightforwardly determnined from the data. The obtained so
boundary layer spectrum is well approximated by the saturated Comptonization
model, its high energy cut-off follows kT~2.4 keV black body. Its independence
on the global mass accretion rate lends support to the theoretical suggestion
by Inogamov &Sunyaev (1999) that the boundary layer is radiation pressure
supported. With this assumption we constrain the gravity on the neutron star
surface and its mass and radius. Equipped with the knowledge of the boundary
layer spectrum we attempt to relate the motion along the Z-track to changes of
physically meaningful parameters. Our results suggest that the contribution of
the boundary layer to the observed emission decreases along the Z-track from
conventional ~50% on the horizontal branch to a rather small number on the
normal branch. This decrease can be caused, for example, by obscuration of the
boundary layer by the geometrically thick accretion disk at Mdot ~ Mdot_Edd.
Alternatively, this can indicate significant change of the structure of the
accretion flow at Mdot ~ Mdot_ Edd and disappearance of the boundary layer as a
distinct region of the significant energy release associated with the neutron
star surface.",2005-06-01T13:54:30Z
Detailed Spectroscopic and Photometric Analysis of DQ White Dwarfs,"We present an analysis of spectroscopic and photometric data for cool DQ
white dwarfs based on improved model atmosphere calculations. In particular, we
revise the atmospheric parameters of the trigonometric parallax sample of
Bergeron et al.(2001), and discuss the astrophysical implications on the
temperature scale and mean mass, as well as the chemical evolution of these
stars. We also analyze 40 new DQ stars discovered in the first data release of
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.",2005-03-04T20:30:31Z
"The Local Group Census: searching for PNe in IC 1613, WLM and GR8","In the framework of the Local Group Census (LGC), a survey of the Local Group
(LG) galaxies above Dec=$-30^\circ$, which is aimed at surveying their
populations with strong emission lines, we have searched for planetary nebulae
(PNe) in the low-metallicity dwarf irregular galaxies IC1613, WLM, GR8. Two new
candidate PNe have been found in IC1613, one in WLM and none in GR8. The
observations presented in this paper, together with the previous results from
the LGC, represent the first step in the study of the PN population in
low-metallicity, dwarf irregular galaxies of the Local Group. They will be
followed by deep spectroscopy to confirm their nature and to study their
physical-chemical properties. We used the observed number of PNe in each LG
galaxy to estimate a lower limit to the mass of the intermediate-age population
which was compared to the Star Formation Rate (SFR) of LG dwarf galaxies. These
results are in agreement with those from accurate star formation history (SFH)
analysis for these small galaxy systems.",2005-05-17T09:56:00Z
High excitation ISM and gas,"An overview is given of ISO results on regions of high excitation ISM and

and their implications highlighted.",2005-03-31T20:07:13Z
The Accretion of Dark Energy onto a Black Hole,"The stationary, spherically symmetric accretion of dark energy onto a
Schwarzschild black hole is considered in terms of relativistic hydrodynamics.
The approximation of an ideal fluid is used to model the dark energy. General
expressions are derived for the accretion rate of an ideal fluid with an
arbitrary equation of state p=p(\rho) onto a black hole. The black hole mass
was found to decrease for the accretion of phantom energy. The accretion
process is studied in detail for two dark energy models that admit an
analytical solution: a model with a linear equation of state,
p=\alpha(\rho-\rho_0), and a Chaplygin gas. For one of the special cases of a
linear equation of state, an analytical expression is derived for the accretion
rate of dark energy onto a moving and rotating black hole. The masses of all
black holes are shown to approach zero in cosmological models with phantom
energy in which the Big Rip scenario is realized.",2005-05-31T11:25:13Z
Tracing the Nature of Dark Energy with Galaxy Distribution,"Dynamical Dark Energy (DE) is a viable alternative to the cosmological
constant. Yet, constructing tests to discriminate between Lambda and dynamical
DE models is difficult because the differences are not large. In this paper we
explore tests based on the galaxy mass function, the void probability function
(VPF), and the number of galaxy clusters. At high z the number density of
clusters shows large differences between DE models, but geometrical factors
reduce the differences substantially. We find that detecting a model dependence
in the cluster redshift distribution is a hard challenge. We show that the
galaxy redshift distribution is potentially a more sensitive characteristics.
We do so by populating dark matter halos in Nbody simulations with galaxies
using well-tested Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD). We also estimate the Void
Probability Function and find that, in samples with the same angular surface
density of galaxies in different models, the VPF is almost model independent
and cannot be used as a test for DE. Once again, geometry and cosmic evolution
compensate each other. By comparing VPF's for samples with fixed galaxy mass
limits, we find measurable differences.",2005-04-05T20:00:06Z
Search for H3+ in HD141569A,"A search for H3+ line emission, reported to have been detected toward the
young star HD 141569A and possibly originating in a clump of planet-forming gas
orbiting the star, has yielded negative results. Observations made at the
United Kingdom Infrared Telescope and at the Subaru Telescope during 2001-2005
covered 11 major transitions of H3+ from 3.42 to 3.99 um. No H3+ emission lines
were detected; one marginal detection at 3.9855 um in June 2002 was not
confirmed in later spectra. The upper limits to the line strengths are
significantly lower than the previously reported detections. Supplemental
slit-scanning spectroscopy using adaptive optics was performed within 0.38 of
HD 141569A to search for extended emission from H3+, but no emission was
detected. We compare our upper limit to the luminosity in H3+ from HD 141569A
with that possible from a gas giant protoplanet and also from a jovian mass
exoplanet in close orbit about its central star.",2005-04-22T22:42:34Z
"Impact of Dark Matter Substructure on the Matter and Weak Lensing Power
  Spectra","We explore the effect of substructure in dark matter halos on the power
spectrum and bispectrum of matter fluctuations and weak lensing shear. By
experimenting with substructure in a cosmological N = 512^3 simulation, we find
that when a larger fraction of the host halo mass is in subhalos, the resulting
power spectrum has less power at 1 < k < 100 h Mpc^{-1} and more power at k >
100 h Mpc^{-1}. We explain this effect using an analytic halo model including
subhalos, which shows that the 1 < k < 100 h Mpc^{-1} regime depends
sensitively on the radial distribution of subhalo centers while the interior
structure of subhalos is important at k > 100 h Mpc^{-1}. The corresponding
effect due to substructures on the weak lensing power spectrum is up to about
11% at angular scale l < 10^4. Predicting the nonlinear power spectrum to a few
percent accuracy for future surveys would therefore require large cosmological
simulations that also have exquisite numerical resolution to model accurately
the survivals of dark matter subhalos in the tidal fields of their hosts.",2005-04-26T00:57:08Z
"The Interpretations For the Low and High Frequency QPO Correlations of
  X-ray Sources Among White Dwarfs, Neutron Stars and Black Holes","It is found that there exists an empirical linear relation between the high
frequency $\nhigh$ and low frequency $\nlow$ of quasi-periodic oscillations
(QPOs) for black hole candidate (BHC), neutron star (NS) and white dwarf (WD)
in the binary systems, which spans five orders of magnitude in frequency.
  For the NS Z (Atoll) sources,
  $\nu_{high}$ and $\nu_{low}$ are identified as the lower kHz QPO frequency
and horizontal branch oscillations (HBOs) $\nh$ (broad noise components); for
the black hole candidates and low-luminosity neutron stars, they are the QPOs
and broad noise components at frequencies between 1 and 10 Hz; for WDs, they
are the ``dwarf nova oscillations'' (DNOs) and QPOs of cataclysmic variables
(CVs). To interpret this relation, our model ascribes $\nu_{high}$ to the
Alfv\'en wave oscillation frequency at a preferred radius and $\nu_{low}$ to
the same mechanism at another radius. Then, we can obtain $\nlow = 0.08
  \nhigh$ and the relation between the upper kHz QPO frequency $\nt$ and HBO to
be $\nh \simeq 56 ({\rm Hz}) (\nt/{\rm kHz})^{2}$, which are in accordance with
the observed empirical relations. Furthermore, some implications of model are
discussed, including why QPO frequencies of white dwarfs and neutron stars span
five orders of magnitude in frequency. \\",2005-02-04T15:05:00Z
Compton scattering in the Klein-Nishina Regime Revisited,"In blazars such as 3C 279, GeV gamma-rays are thought to be produced by
inverse Compton scattering of soft photons injected from external sources into
the jet. Because of the large bulk Lorentz factor of the jet, the energy of
soft photons is Doppler shifted in the comoving frame of the jet, and the
scattering is likely to occur in the Klein-Nishina regime. Although the
Klein-Nishina effects are well known, the properties of the electron and
emission spectra have not been studied in detail in the environment of blazars.
We solve the kinetic equation of electrons with the spatial escape term of the
electrons to obtain the electron energy spectrum in the jet and calculated the
observed emission spectrum. In calculations of the Compton losses in the
Klein-Nishina regime, we use the discrete loss formalism to take into account
the significant energy loss in a single scattering. Although the scattering
cross section decreases because of the Klein-Nishina effects, ample gamma rays
are emitted by inverse Compton scattering. When the injection spectrum of
electrons obeys a power law, the electron spectrum does not follow a broken
power law, as a result of the Klein-Nishina effects, and a large number of
high-energy electrons remain in the emitting region.",2005-03-10T04:19:39Z
"Evidence for a magnitude-dependent bias in the Hamburg/ESO Survey for
  Damped Lyman-alpha Systems","We present preliminary results from the Hamburg/ESO survey for Damped
Ly-alpha (hereafter, DLA) Systems. This survey is characterized by (i) the good
knowledge of the biases affecting the parent QSO survey, (ii) the brightness
and (iii) the relatively wide magnitude distribution of the background QSOs.
Therefore, it is well-suited to study possible magnitude-dependent biases in
DLA surveys, such as the one expected from dust obscuration. We have
systematically searched for damped Lyman-alpha line candidates in 5 A
resolution spectra of the 188 QSOs that constitute our statistical sample.
These candidates have later been reobserved with UVES at the ESO--Very Large
Telescope (VLT) for confirmation and accurate N(HI) measurements. In the
redshift range covered by the survey, 19 DLA systems have been discovered. Over
the whole survey, we find that the number density, n(z), and cosmological
density of gas, Omega_gas, have comparable values to the ones obtained by
CORALS (Ellison et al. 2001). However, the number densities of DLA systems n(z)
in two sub-samples of equal absorption distance path defined by the magnitude
of the background QSOs differ by a factor of about 5. We estimate that the
probability that n(z) is equal in the two sub-samples is < 0.003. A similar,
only slightly less significant difference is found for Omega_gas.",2005-04-29T10:58:35Z
Close Binaries as the Progenitors of the Brightest Planetary Nebulae,"We investigate the possible progenitors of the planetary nebulae (PNs) which
populate the top 0.5 mag of the [O III] 5007 planetary nebula luminosity
function (PNLF). We show that the absolute luminosity of the PNLF cutoff
demands that the central stars of these most luminous planetaries be greater
than 0.6 Msun, and that such high-mass PN cores must exist in every galaxy. We
also use the bolometric-luminosity specific PN number density to show that in
early-type galaxies, [O III]-bright planetaries are relatively rare, with only
about 10% of stars evolving to these bright magnitudes. We demonstrate that the
combination of these two facts implies that either all early-type systems
contain a small, smoothly distributed component of young (< 1 Gyr old) stars,
or another mechanism exists for creating high-core mass planetaries. We argue
that binary-star evolution is this second mechanism, and demonstrate that blue
stragglers have the appropriate core properties and number density to explain
the observations. We discuss the implications of this alternative mode of
stellar evolution, and speculate on how coalesced binaries might affect the use
of PNs for measuring a galaxy's star-formation history and chemical evolution.",2005-04-27T21:01:53Z
"Discovery of a Fifth Image of the Large Separation Gravitationally
  Lensed Quasar SDSS J1004+4112","We report the discovery of a fifth image in the large separation lensed
quasar system SDSS J1004+4112. A faint point source located 0.2'' from the
center of the brightest galaxy in the lensing cluster is detected in images
taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and the Near Infrared Camera
and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) on the Hubble Space Telescope. The flux
ratio between the point source and the brightest lensed component in the ACS
image is similar to that in the NICMOS image. The location and brightness of
the point source are consistent with lens model predictions for a lensed image.
We therefore conclude that the point source is likely to be a fifth image of
the source quasar. In addition, the NICMOS image reveals the lensed host galaxy
of the source quasar, which can strongly constrain the structure of the lensing
critical curves and thereby the mass distribution of the lensing cluster.",2005-03-15T09:48:33Z
Phase-space mixing and the merging of cusps,"Collisionless stellar systems are driven towards equilibrium by mixing of
phase-space elements. I show that the excess-mass function D(f)= int_{F(x,v)>f}
(F(x,v)-f) d^3x d^3v (with F(x,v) the coarse-grained distribution function)
always decreases on mixing. D(f) gives the excess mass from values of
F(x,v))>f. This novel form of the mixing theorem extends the maximum
phase-space density argument to all values of f. The excess-mass function can
be computed from N-body simulations and is additive: the excess mass of a
combination of non-overlapping systems is the sum of their individual D(f). I
propose a novel interpretation for the coarse-grained distribution function,
which avoids conceptual problems with the mixing theorem.
  As an example application, I show that for self-gravitating cusps (rho propto
r^{-gamma} as r->0) the excess mass D propto f^{-2(3-gamma)/(6-gamma)} as
f->oo, i.e. steeper cusps are less mixed than shallower ones, independent of
the shape of surfaces of constant density or details of the distribution
function (e.g. anisotropy). This property, together with the additivity of D(f)
and the mixing theorem, implies that a merger remnant cannot have a cusp
steeper than the steepest of its progenitors. Furthermore, I argue that the
remnant's cusp should not be shallower either, implying that the steepest cusp
always survives.",2005-04-11T15:30:39Z
Supernovae and Gamma-Ray Bursts Powered by Hot Neutrino-Cooled Coronae,"Cosmological explosions such as core-collapse supernovae (SNe) and gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) are thought to be powered by the rapid conversion of roughly a
solar mass' worth of gravitational binding energy into a comparatively small
amount of outgoing observable kinetic energy. A fractional absorption of the
emitted neutrinos, the particles which carry away the binding energy, by the
expelled matter is a widely discussed mechanism for powering such explosions.
Previous work addressing neutrino emission from core-collapse like environments
assumes that the outgoing neutrino spectrum closely resembles a black body
whose effective temperature is determined by both the rate of energy release
and the surface area of the entire body. Unfortunately, this assumption
minimizes the net efficiency for both neutrino-driven explosion mechanisms.
Motivated by this fact, we qualitatively outline a scenario where a hot corona
deforms the neutrino spectrum away from that of a cool thermal emitter. Our
primary result is that in principle, a coronal-driven explosion mechanism can
enhance the net efficiency of neutrino-driven SNe and GRBs by more than an
order of magnitude.",2005-04-11T22:18:50Z
"$XMM-Newton$ $Ω$ project: III. Gas mass fraction shape in high
  redshift clusters","We study the gas mass fraction, $f\_{\rm gas},$ behavior in $XMM-Newton$
$\Omega$ project. The typical $f\_{\rm gas}$ shape of high redshift galaxy
clusters follows the global shape inferred at low redshift quite well. This
result is consistent with the gravitational instability picture leading to self
similar structures for both the dark and baryonic matter. However, the mean
$f\_{\rm gas} in distant clusters shows some differences to local ones,
indicating a departure from strict scaling. This result is consistent with the
observed evolution in the luminosity-temperature relation. We quantitatively
investigate this departure from scaling laws. Within the local sample we used,
a moderate but clear variation of the amplitude of the gas mass fraction with
temperature is found, a trend that weakens in the outer regions. These
variations do not explain departure from scaling laws of our distant clusters.
An important implication of our results is that the gas fraction evolution, a
test of the cosmological parameters, can lead to biased values when applied at
radii smaller than the virial radius. From our $XMM$ clusters, the apparent gas
fraction at the virial radius is consistent with a non-evolving universal value
in a high matter density model and not with a concordance.",2005-03-19T10:20:47Z
"Hydrodynamical stellar models including rotation, internal gravity waves
  and atomic diffusion. I. Formalism and tests on Pop I dwarfs","In this paper, we develop a formalism in order to incorporate the
contribution of internal gravity waves to the transport of angular momentum and
chemicals over long time-scales in stars. We show that the development of a
double peaked shear layer acts as a filter for waves, and how the asymmetry of
this filter produces momentum extraction from the core when it is rotating
faster than the surface. Using only this filtered flux, it is possible to
follow the contribution of internal waves over long (evolutionary) time-scales.
  We then present the evolution of the internal rotation profile using this
formalism for stars which are spun down via magnetic torquing. We show that
waves tend to slow down the core, creating a ""slow"" front that may then
propagate from the core to the surface. Further spin down of the surface leads
to the formation of a new front. Finally we show how this momentum transport
reduces rotational mixing in a 1.2Msun, Z=0.02 model, leading to a surface
lithium abundance in agreement with observations in the Hyades.",2005-05-11T12:48:31Z
"Star-formation in NGC 4038/4039 from broad- and narrow band photometry:
  Cluster Destruction?","Accurately determining the star formation history in NGC 4038/4039 -- ``The
Antennae'' is hampered by extinction. We therefore used near infrared images
obtained with ISAAC at the VLT and with SOFI at the NTT to determine the recent
star formation history in this merger. In combination with archival HST data,
we determined ages, extinction and other parameters for single star clusters,
and properties of the cluster population as a whole. About 70% of the K_s-band
detected star clusters with masses >= 10^5 M_sun are younger than 10 Myrs
(approximately an e-folding time for cluster ages), which we interpret as
evidence for rapid dissolution but not free expansion. The total mass of K-band
selected clusters is about 5-10x10^8 M_sun and represents about 3-6% of the
total molecular gas. This takes into account only the detected clusters and in
view of the rapid dissolution means that this is only a lower limit to the
total mass of stars produced in clusters during the burst. Studies of cluster
formation in other galaxies recently suggested short cluster dissolution
timescales, too, which means that star formation rates may have been severely
underestimated in the past. Extinction is strongly variable and very high in
some regions, but around A_V=1.3 mag on average. Even though most clusters are
detected at least in I-band, only the information about individual cluster ages
and extinction allows to avoid uncertainties of orders of magnitude in star
formation rate estimates determined from optical fluxes. From the distribution
of individual cluster extinction vs. age, which is significantly higher for
clusters below 8-9 Myr than for older clusters, we infer that this is the time
by which a typical cluster blows free of its native dust cocoon.",2005-05-20T16:04:12Z
"Classifications of the Host Galaxies of Supernovae, Set III","A homogeneous sample comprising host galaxies of 604 recent supernovae,
including 212 objects discovered primarily in 2003 and 2004, has been
classified on the David Dunlap Observatory system. Most SN 1991bg-like SNe Ia
occur in E and E/Sa galaxies, whereas the majority of SN 1991T-like SNe Ia
occur in intermediate-type galaxies. This difference is significant at the
99.9% level. As expected, all types of SNe II are rare in early-type galaxies,
whereas normal SNe Ia occur in all Hubble types. This difference is significant
at the 99.99% level. A small number of SNe II in E galaxies might be due to
galaxy classification errors, or to a small young-population component in these
mainly old objects. No significant difference is found between the
distributions over Hubble type of SNe Ibc and SNe II. This confirms that both
of these types of objects have similar (massive) progenitors. The present data
show that, in order to understand the dependence of supernova type on
host-galaxy population, it is more important to obtain accurate morphological
classifications than it is to increase the size of the data sample.",2005-04-29T17:46:33Z
"Cooling of Accelerated Nucleons and Neutrino Emission in Gamma-Ray
  Bursts","Using Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate photopion production from
Fermi-accelerated protons and the resulting neutrino production in gamma-ray
bursts. Unless internal shocks occur at quite large distance from the center,
ultra high-energy protons are depleted by photopion production and synchrotron
radiation. Internal shocks at fiducial distance cause neutrino bursts, which
accompany gamma-ray bursts originating from electromagnetic cascades.",2005-03-11T13:48:43Z
Galaxy mergers with various mass ratios: properties of remnants,"We study galaxy mergers with various mass ratios using N-body simulations,
with an emphasis on the unequal-mass mergers in the relatively unexplored range
of mass-ratios 4:1-10:1. Our recent work (Bournaud et al. 2004) shows that the
above range of mass ratio results in hybrid systems with spiral-like luminosity
profiles but with elliptical-like kinematics, as observed in the data analysis
for a sample of mergers by Jog & Chitre (2002). In this paper, we study the
merger-remnants for mass ratios from 1:1 to 10:1 while systematically covering
the parameter space. We obtain the morphological and kinematical properties of
the remnants, and also discuss the robustness and the visibility of disks in
the merger remnants with a random line-of-sight. We show that the mass ratios
1:1-3:1 give rise to elliptical remnants whereas the mass ratios 4.5:1-10:1
produce the hybrid systems with mixed properties. We find that the transition
between disk-like and elliptical remnants occurs between a narrow mass-range of
4.5:1-3:1. The unequal-mass mergers are more likely to occur than the standard
equal-mass mergers studied in the literature so far, and we discuss their
implications for the evolution of galaxies.",2005-03-08T17:02:46Z
"H-D Substitution in Interstellar Solid Methanol: A Key Route for D
  Enrichment","Deuterium enrichment of interstellar methanol is reproduced experimentally
for the first time via grain-surface H-D substitution in solid methanol at an
atomic D/H ratio of 0.1. Although previous gas-grain models successfully
reproduce the deuterium enrichments observed in interstellar methanol molecules
(D/H of up to 0.4, compared to the cosmic ratio of $\sim 10^{-5})$, the models
exclusively focus on deuterium fractionation resulting from the successive
addition of atomic hydrogen/deuterium on CO. The mechanism proposed here
represents a key route for deuterium enrichment that reproduces the high
observed abundances of deuterated methanol, including multiple deuterations.",2005-03-28T08:29:09Z
The temperature structure in the core of Sersic 159-03,"We present results from a new 120 ks XMM-Newton observation of the cluster of
galaxies Sersic 159-03. In this paper we focus on the high-resolution X-ray
spectra obtained with the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS). The spectra
allow us to constrain the temperature structure in the core of the cluster and
determine the emission measure distribution as a function of temperature. We
also fit the line widths of mainly oxygen and iron lines.",2005-04-12T07:53:53Z
"The Evolution of the Optical and Near-Infrared Galaxy Luminosity
  Functions and Luminosity Densities to z~2","Using Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based U through K- band photometry
from the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS), we measure the
evolution of the luminosity function and luminosity density in the rest-frame
optical (UBR) to z ~ 2, bridging the poorly explored ``redshift desert''
between z~1 and z~2. We also use deep near-infrared observations to measure the
evolution in the rest-frame J-band to z~1. Compared to local measurements from
the SDSS, we find a brightening of the characteristic magnitude, (M*), by ~2.1,
\~0.8 and ~0.7 mag between z=0.1 and z=1.9, in U, B, and R bands, respectively.
The evolution of M* in the J-band is in the opposite sense, showing a dimming
between redshifts z=0.4 and z=0.9. This is consistent with a scenario in which
the mean star formation rate in galaxies was higher in the past, while the mean
stellar mass was lower, in qualitative agreement with hierarchical galaxy
formation models. We find that the shape of the luminosity function is strongly
dependent on spectral type and that there is strong evolution with redshift in
the relative contribution from the different spectral types to the luminosity
density.
  We find good agreement in the luminosity function derived from an R-selected
and a K-selected sample at z~1, suggesting that optically selected surveys of
similar depth (R < 24) are not missing a significant fraction of objects at
this redshift relative to a near-infrared-selected sample. We compare the
rest-frame B-band luminosity functions from z~0--2 with the predictions of a
semi-analytic hierarchical model of galaxy formation, and find qualitatively
good agreement. In particular, the model predicts at least as many optically
luminous galaxies at z~1--2 as are implied by our observations.",2005-05-13T19:54:06Z
The Fine Structure Lines of Hydrogen in HII Regions,"The 2s_{1/2} state of hydrogen is metastable and overpopulated in HII
regions. In addition, the 2p states may be pumped by ambient Lyman-alpha
radiation. Fine structure transitions between these states may be observable in
HII regions at 1.1 GHz (2s_{1/2}-2p_{1/2}) and/or 9.9 GHz (2s_{1/2}-2p_{3/2}),
although the details of absorption versus emission are determined by the
relative populations of the 2s and 2p states. The n=2 level populations are
solved with a parameterization that allows for Lyman-alpha pumping of the 2p
states. The density of Lyman-alpha photons is set by their creation rate,
easily determined from the recombination rate, and their removal rate. Here we
suggest that the dominant removal mechanism of Lyman-alpha radiation in HII
regions is absorption by dust. This circumvents the need to solve the
Lyman-alpha transfer problem, and provides an upper limit to the rate at which
the 2p states are populated by Lyman-alpha photons. In virtually all cases of
interest, the 2p states are predominantly populated by recombination, rather
than Lyman-alpha pumping. We then solve the radiative transfer problem for the
fine structure lines in the presence of free-free radiation. In the likely
absence of Lyman-alpha pumping, the 2s_{1/2}-2p_{1/2} lines will appear in
stimulated emission and the 2s_{1/2}-2p_{3/2} lines in absorption. Searching
for the 9.9 GHz lines in high emission measure HII regions offers the best
prospects for detection. The lines are predicted to be weak; in the best cases,
line-to-continuum ratios of several tenths of a percent might be expected with
line strengths of tens to a hundred mK with the Green Bank Telescope.",2005-05-21T00:53:42Z
The giant H-alpha/X-ray filament in the cluster of galaxies A1795,"The cluster of galaxies A1795 hosts a 46 kpc-long filament at its core, which
is clearly visible in the light of H-alpha and X-ray emission. We present
optical slit spectroscopy and deeper Chandra X-ray data of the filament. The
optical spectra reveal that the the bulk of the filament is quiescent (with
sigma < 130 km/s), although considerable velocity structure is apparent around
the powerful radio source in the central cluster galaxy, where a direct
interaction is occurring between the radio plasma and the surrounding
intracluster medium. The filament contains a clump of UV/blue continuum halfway
along its length, which we resolve into a chain of at least 5 distinct knots
using archival HST images; the optical spectrum of this clump confirm it to be
mostly comprised of O stars. It is well-removed from the central galaxy and
radio source, and is most likely an example of a group of young star clusters
condensing directly from the cooling gas in the filament. The observed spatial
offset between these knots of star formation and the peak in the optical line
emission confirms that the massive star formation is most unlikely to be
responsible for the bulk of the observed emission-line luminosity in the
filament. Some other (as yet undetermined) source of energy is required to
power and maintain the optical line-emission, yet it must not completely impede
the cooling of the X-ray gas within the filament to form the star clusters.",2005-05-04T11:12:33Z
Integral Field Spectroscopy of Faint Haloes of Planetary Nebulae,"We present the first integral field spectroscopy observations of the two
planetary nebulae NGC3242 and NGC4361 with the VIMOS instrument attached to
VLT-UT3. By co-adding a large number of spaxels we reach an emission line
detection limit of 5.E-18 erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} arcsec^{-2}. In the case of
NGC3242, we succeed in determining some properties of the halo. The radial
surface brightness profile in [OIII] implies increasing mass loss before the
formation of the PN. Traces of the mysterious 'rings' are clearly visible. We
find for the first time an apparent temperature gradient across a halo: from
about 16000 K close to the shell/halo transition to 20000 K at the halo's outer
edge. No line emission is seen in the suspected halo region of NGC4361 down to
the sensitivity limit.",2005-06-14T10:03:30Z
"Fourier Transform Spectroscopy of the submillimetre continuum emission
  from hot molecular cores","We have used a Fourier Transform Spectrometer on the James Clerk Maxwell
Telescope to study the submillimetre continuum emission from dust in three hot
molecular cores (HMC). The spectral index beta of the dust emission for these
sources has been determined solely within the 30 GHz wide 350 GHz (850 micron)
passband to an accuracy comparable to those determined through multi-wavelength
observations. We find an average beta = 1.6, in agreement with spectral indices
determined from previous submillimetre observations of these sources and with
those determined for HMC in general. The largest single source of uncertainty
in these results is the variability of the atmosphere at 350 GHz, and with
better sky subtraction techniques we show that the dust spectral index can
clearly be determined within one passband to high accuracy with a submillimetre
FTS. Using an imaging FTS on SCUBA-2, the next generation wide-field
submillimetre camera currently under development to replace SCUBA at the JCMT
in 2006, we calculate that at 350 GHz it will be possible to determine beta to
+/- 0.1 for sources as faint as 400 mJy/beam and to +/- 0.3 for sources as
faint as 140 mJy/beam.",2005-05-16T21:23:24Z
"Nuclear Accretion in Galaxies of the Local Universe: Clues from Chandra
  Observations","In order to find an explanation for the radiative quiescence of supermassive
black holes in the local Universe, for a sample of nearby galaxies the most
accurate estimates are collected for the mass of a central black hole M_BH, the
nuclear X-ray luminosity L_X,nuc and the circumnuclear hot gas density and
temperature, by using Chandra data. L_X,nuc varies by \sim 3 orders of
magnitude and does not show a relationship with M_BH or with the Bondi mass
accretion rate \dotM_B. L_X,nuc is always much lower than expected if \dotM_B
ends in a standard accretion disc with high radiative efficiency (this instead
can be the case of the active nucleus of Cen A). Radiatively inefficient
accretion as in the standard ADAF modeling may explain the low luminosities of
a few cases; for others, the predicted luminosity is still too high and, in
terms of Eddington-scaled quantities, it is increasingly higher than observed,
for increasing \dotM_B. Variants of the simple radiatively inefficient scenario
including outflow and convection may reproduce the low emission levels
observed, since the amount of matter actually accreted is reduced considerably.
However, the most promising scenario includes feedback from accretion on the
surrounding gas: this has the important advantages of naturally explaining the
observed lack of relationship between L_X,nuc, M_BH and \dotM_B, and of evading
the problem of the fate of the material accumulating in the central galactic
regions over cosmological times.",2005-02-02T09:11:18Z
"Iron-line and continuum flux variations in the RXTE spectra of the
  black-hole candidate XTE J1650-500","We present the results of spectral fits made to 57 pointed observations of
the Galactic black hole candidate and X-ray transient XTE J1650-500, made with
the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer in 2001 when the source was in a transition
from the hard state to the soft state. A strong and variable Fe K-alpha
emission line is detected in these spectra. The line flux varies in a
non-linear way with the hard X-ray flux, in apparent contradiction to the
predictions of simple disc reflection models. We observe a change in the
overall trend that coincides with changes in t he continuum X-ray spectrum and
the fast X-ray variability. The Fe-line flux versus hard X-ray flux variations
are consistent with the predictions of reflection models which consider high
disc-ionization states and with a model which considers gravitational
light-bending effects. Indications for an anti-correlation between the Fe-line
flux and the hard X-ray flux in the spectrally hardest observations and weak
variations in the Fe-line energy (as observed with XMM-Newton and BeppoSAX)
slightly favour the light-bending interpretation.",2005-04-07T16:07:41Z
"Infrared Surface Brightness Distances to Cepheids: a comparison of
  Bayesian and linear-bisector calculations","We have compared the results of Bayesian statistical calculations and
linear-bisector calculations for obtaining Cepheid distances and radii by the
infrared surface brightness method. We analyzed a set of 38 Cepheids using a
Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method that had been recently studied with a
linear-bisector method. The distances obtained by the two techniques agree to
1.5 \pm 0.6% with the Bayesian distances being larger. The radii agree to 1.1%
\pm 0.7% with the Bayesian determinations again being larger. We interpret this
result as demonstrating that the two methods yield the same distances and
radii. This implies that the short distance to the LMC found in recent
linear-bisector studies of Cepheids is not caused by deficiencies in the
mathematical treatment. However, the computed uncertainties in distance and
radius for our dataset are larger in the Bayesian calculation by factors of
1.4-6.7. We give reasons to favor the Bayesian computations of the
uncertainties. The larger uncertainties can have a significant impact upon
interpretation of Cepheid distances and radii obtained from the infrared
surface brightness method.",2005-06-03T15:25:24Z
"Squared visibility estimator. Calibrating biases to reach very high
  dynamic range","In the near infrared where detectors are limited by read-out noise, most
interferometers have been operated in wide band in order to benefit from larger
photon rates. We analyze in this paper the biases caused by instrumental and
turbulent effects to $V^2$ estimators for both narrow and wide band cases.
Visibilities are estimated from samples of the interferogram using two
different estimators, $V^{2}_1$ which is the classical sum of the squared
modulus of Fourier components and a new estimator $V^{2}_2$ for which complex
Fourier components are summed prior to taking the square. We present an
approach for systematically evaluating the performance and limits of each
estimator, and to optimizing observing parameters for each. We include the
effects of spectral bandwidth, chromatic dispersion, scan length, and
differential piston. We also establish the expression of the Signal-to-Noise
Ratio of the two estimators with respect to detector and photon noise. The
$V^{2}_1$ estimator is insensitive to dispersion and is always more sensitive
than the $V^{2}_2$ estimator. However, the latter allows to reach better
accuracies when detection is differential piston noise limited. Biases and
noise directly impact the dynamic range of reconstructed images. Very high
dynamic ranges are required for direct exoplanet detection by interferometric
techniques thus requiring estimators to be bias-free or biases to be accurately
calibrated. We discuss which estimator and which conditions are optimum for
astronomical applications especially when high accuracy visibilities are
required. We show that there is no theoretical limit to measuring visibilities
with accuracies as good as $10^{-5}$ which is important in the prospect of
detecting faint exoplanets with interferometers.",2005-02-22T09:04:54Z
Hot Cores : Probes of High-Redshift Galaxies,"The very high rates of second generation star formation detected and inferred
in high redshift objects should be accompanied by intense millimetre-wave
emission from hot core molecules. We calculate the molecular abundances likely
to arise in hot cores associated with massive star formation at high redshift,
using several independent models of metallicity in the early Universe. If the
number of hot cores exceeds that in the Milky Way Galaxy by a factor of at
least one thousand, then a wide range of molecules in high redshift hot cores
should have detectable emission. It should be possible to distinguish between
independent models for the production of metals and hence hot core molecules
should be useful probes of star formation at high redshift.",2005-04-01T22:38:20Z
"The 3-D shaping of NGC 6741: a massive, fast-evolving Planetary Nebula
  at the recombination--reionization edge","We infer the gas kinematics, diagnostics and ionic radial profiles, distance
and central star parameters, nebular photo- ionization model, spatial structure
and evolutionary phase of the PN NGC 6741 by means of long-slit high-resolution
spectra at nine position angles. NGC 6741 (distance ~2.0 kpc, age ~1400 yr,
ionized mass Mion ~0.06 Mo) is a dense (electron density up to 12,000 cm^(-3)),
high-excitation, almost- prolate ellipsoid, surrounded by a sharp
low-excitation skin (the ionization front), and embedded into a spherical
(radius ~ 0.080 pc), almost-neutral, high-density (n(HI) ~7 x 10^3 atoms
cm^(-3)) halo containing a large fraction of the nebular mass (Mhalo>0.20 Mo).
The kinematics, physical conditions and ionic structure indicate that NGC 6741
is in a deep recombination phase, started about 200 years ago, and caused by
the quick luminosity drop of the massive (M*=0.66-0.68 Mo), hot (logT* ~ 5.23)
and faint (log L*/Lo ~ 2.75) post--AGB star, which has exhausted the
hydrogen-shell nuclear burning and is moving along the white dwarf cooling
sequence. The general expansion law of the ionized gas in NGC 6741, Vexp (km
s^(-1)=13 x R"", fails in the innermost, highest-excitation layers, which move
slower than expected. The observed deceleration is ascribable to the luminosity
drop of the central star, and appears in striking contrast to recent reports
inferring that acceleration is a common property of the Planetary Nebulae
innermost layers. Some general implications on the shaping mechanisms of
Planetary Nebulae are discussed.",2005-02-04T15:01:44Z
Constraints on jet X-ray emission in low/hard state X-ray binaries,"We show that the combination of the similarities between the X-ray properties
of low luminosity accreting black holes and accreting neutron stars, combined
with the differences in their radio properties argues that the X-rays from
these systems are unlikely to be formed in the relativistic jets. Specifically,
the spectra of extreme island state neutron stars and low/hard state black
holes are known to be indistinguishable, while the power spectra from these
systems are known to show only minor differences beyond what would be expected
from scaling the characteristic variability frequencies by the mass of the
compact object. The spectral and temporal similarities thus imply a common
emission mechanism that has only minor deviations from having all key
parameters scaling linearly with the mass of the compact object, while we show
that this is inconsistent with the observations that the radio powers of
neutron stars are typically about 30 times lower than those of black holes at
the same X-ray luminosity. We also show that an abrupt luminosity change would
be expected when a system makes a spectral state transition from a radiatively
inefficient jet dominated accretion flow to a thin disk dominated flow, but
that such a change is not seen.",2005-03-31T10:02:18Z
"Modeling the Jovian subnebula: I - Thermodynamical conditions and
  migration of proto-satellites","We have developed an evolutionary turbulent model of the Jovian subnebula
consistent with the extended core accretion formation models of Jupiter
described by Alibert et al. (2005b) and derived from Alibert et al.
(2004,2005a). This model takes into account the vertical structure of the
subnebula, as well as the evolution of the surface density as given by an
$\alpha$-disk model and is used to calculate the thermodynamical conditions in
the subdisk, for different values of the viscosity parameter. We show that the
Jovian subnebula evolves in two different phases during its lifetime. In the
first phase, the subnebula is fed through its outer edge by the solar nebula as
long as it has not been dissipated. In the second phase, the solar nebula has
disappeared and the Jovian subdisk expands and gradually clears with time as
Jupiter accretes the remaining material. We also demonstrate that early
generations of satellites formed during the beginning of the first phase of the
subnebula cannot survive in this environment and fall onto the proto-Jupiter.
As a result, these bodies may contribute to the enrichment of Jupiter in heavy
elements. Moreover, migration calculations in the Jovian subnebula allow us to
follow the evolution of the ices/rocks ratios in the proto-satellites as a
function of their migration pathways. By a tempting to reproduce the distance
distribution of the Galilean satellites, as well as their ices/rocks ratios, we
obtain some constraints on the viscosity parameter of the Jovian subnebula.",2005-05-18T10:04:13Z
"Disk-Halo-Disk Circulation and the Evolution of the ISM - 3D HD and MHD
  Adaptive Mesh Refinement Simulations","State of the art models of the ISM use adaptive mesh refinement to capture
small scale structures, by refining on the fly those regions of the grid where
density and pressure gradients occur, keeping at the same time the existing
resolution in the other regions. With this technique it became possible to
study the ISM in star-forming galaxies in a global way by following matter
circulation between stars and the interstellar gas, and, in particular the
energy input by random and clustered supernova explosions, which determine the
dynamical and chemical evolution of the ISM, and hence of the galaxy as a
whole. In this paper we review the conditions for a self-consistent modelling
of the ISM and present the results from the latest developments in the 3D
HD/MHD global models of the ISM. Special emphasis is put on the effects of the
magnetic field with respect to the volume and mass fractions of the different
ISM ``phases'', the relative importance of ram, thermal and magnetic pressures,
and whether the field can prevent matter transport from the disk into the halo.
The simulations were performed on a grid with a square area of 1 kpc$^{2}$,
centered on the solar circle, extending $\pm 10$ kpc perpendicular to the
galactic disk with a resolution as high as 1.25 pc. The run time scale was 400
Myr, sufficiently long to avoid memory effects of the initial setup, and to
allow for a global dynamical equilibrium to be reached in case of a constant
energy input rate.",2005-02-03T19:27:40Z
"The OH 1612 MHz maser pump rates of stellar, interstellar and post-AGB
  OH masers","(Pseudo) radiative pumprate of OH 1612 MHz masers is defined for a sample of
44 OH/IR sources (infrared sources with OH 1612 MHz maser), irrespective of the
real maser pumping mechanisms. The correlation between the (pseudo) maser
pumprates and the evolutionary status of the maser sources reveals that the
radiative pumprates of stellar OH masers are nearly fixed, which agrees with
the theoretical prediction for radiatively pumped OH maser. The (pseudo)
radiative pumprates of interstellar OH masers are not only very small but also
varying broadly over two orders of magnitude, which is argued to be the
manifestation of varying number of quiet absorbing OH cloudlets and/or various
OH maser pumping mechanisms and/or competitive gain between mainline and 1612
MHz OH masers and/or anisotropy of the maser emission. The radiative pumprates
of post-AGB OH masers very possibly decrease with increasing IRAS C32 color
indices and distribute in an interim region between the stellar and
interstellar OH masers in the pumprate-color diagram.",2005-02-21T03:40:43Z
On the new short orbital period cataclysmic variable Halpha0242-2802,"We present results from our phase-resolved spectroscopy of the newly
identified cataclysmic variable Halpha0242-2802. Halpha0242-2802 was identified
from a deep UK Schmidt Halpha-R band survey as a candidate cataclysmic
variable. Although initial spectroscopy revealed an optical spectrum very
similar to that of the famous short orbital period system WZ Sge, the analysis
of our data shows that this is not the case. Halpha0242-28 differs from WZ Sge
in both the accretion disk structure and the orbital period. In particular,
Halpha0242-28 appears to be a system which has not reached the orbital period
minimum, yet.",2005-06-13T17:57:31Z
Neutrino emissivity under neutral kaon condensation,"Neutrino emissivity from neutron star matter with neutral kaon condensate is
considered. It is shown that a new cooling channel is opened, and what is more,
all previously known channels acquire the greater emissivity reaching the level
of the direct URCA cycle in normal matter.",2005-03-30T14:16:13Z
"Highly Clumpy Structure of the Thermal Composite Supernova Remnant 3C391
  Unveiled by Chandra","The nature of the internal thermal X-ray emission seen in ``thermal
composite"" supernova remnants is still uncertain. Chandra observation of the
3C391 shows a southeast-northwest elongated morphology and unveils a highly
clumpy structure of the remnant. Detailed spatially resolved spectral analysis
for the small-scale features reveals normal metal abundance and uniform
temperature for the interior gas. The properties of the hot gas comparatively
favor the cloudlet evaporation model as a main mechanism for the ``thermal
composite"" X-ray appearance, though radiative rim and thermal conduction may
also be effective. A faint protrusion is found in Si and S lines out of the
southwest radio border.",2005-05-02T15:34:25Z
"Magnetic field in Cepheus A as deduced from OH maser polarimetric
  observations","We present the results of MERLIN polarization mapping of OH masers at 1665
and 1667 MHz towards the Cepheus A star-forming region. The maser emission is
spread over a region of 6 arcsec by 10 arcsec, twice the extent previously
detected. In contrast to the 22 GHz water masers, the OH masers associated with
H II regions show neither clear velocity gradients nor regular structures. We
identified ten Zeeman pairs which imply a magnetic field strength along the
line-of-sight from -17.3 to +12.7 mG. The magnetic field is organised on the
arcsecond scale, pointing towards us in the west and away from us in the east
side. The linearly polarized components, detected for the first time, show
regularities in the polarization position angles depending on their position.
The electric vectors of OH masers observed towards the outer parts of H II
regions are consistent with the interstellar magnetic field orientation, while
those seen towards the centres of H II regions are parallel to the radio-jets.
A Zeeman quartet inside a southern H II region has now been monitored for 25
years; we confirm that the magnetic field decays monotonically over that
period.",2005-05-18T12:55:31Z
"Can the Steep Mass Profile of A1689 Be Explained by a Triaxial Dark
  Halo?","The steep mass profile of A1689 derived from recent detailed lensing
observations is not readily reconciled with the low concentration halos
predicted by the standard CDM model. However, halo triaxiality may act to bias
the profile constraints derived assuming a spherically symmetric mass
distribution, since lensing relates only to the projected mass distribution. A
degree of halo triaxiality is inherent to the CDM structure formation, arising
from the collision-less nature of the dark matter. Here we compare the
CDM-based model predictions of triaxial halo with the precise lensing
measurements of A1689 based on the ACS/HST and Subaru data, over a wide range
of 10kpc<r<2Mpc. The model lensing profiles cover the intrinsic spread of halo
mass and shape, and are projected over all inclinations when comparing with the
data. We show that the model parameters are only weakly constrained and
strongly degenerate mainly because of the lack of information along the line of
sight. In particular, the limits on the concentration parameter become less
restrictive with increasing triaxiality. Yet, by comparing the obtained
constraints with expected probability distributions for the axis ratio and
concentration parameters computed from numerical simulations, we find that ~6%
of cluster-size halos in the CDM model can match the A1689 lensing observations
at the 2-sigma level, corresponding to cases where the major-axis of the halo
is aligned with the line of sight. Thus halo triaxiality could reduce the
apparent discrepancy between theory and observation. This hypothesis needs to
be further explored by a statistical lensing study for other clusters as well
as by complementary three-dimensional information derived using X-ray,
kinematics, and SZ effect observations.",2005-05-20T20:45:58Z
The K-band spectrum of the Cataclysmic Variable RXJ 0502.8+1624 (Tau 4),"We present the K-band spectrum of the cataclysmic variable RXJ 0502.8+1624
(Tau 4). The spectrum shows a broad, smooth hump, with no absorption lines from
the secondary star visible. This result indicates that the infrared light of
this system is dominated by cyclotron emission, and, in combination with the
optical spectrum and X-ray properties, suggests that Tau 4 is a polar-type
cataclysmic variable (CV).
  The system was chosen for study because the broadband JHK colours of Tau 4
are consistent with an L-type dwarf, suggesting that this system might harbour
an elusive sub-stellar secondary star. The result presented here, along with
the recent discovery of cyclotron emission in the cataclysmic variable EF Eri,
suggests that care must be taken when using the broadband JHK colours of CVs
when targeting searches for sub-stellar secondary stars",2005-06-03T10:52:49Z
"A Photometric Diagnostic to Aid in the Identification of Transiting
  Extra-Solar Planets","One of the obstacles in the search for exoplanets via transits is the large
number of candidates that must be followed up, few of which ultimately prove to
be exoplanets. Any method that could make this process more efficient by
somehow identifying the best candidates and eliminating the worst would
therefore be very useful. Seager and Mallen-Ornelas (2003) demonstrated that it
was possible to discern between blends and exoplanets using only the
photometric characteristics of the transits. However, these techniques are
critically dependent on the shape of the transit, characterization of which
requires very high precision photometry of a sort that is atypical for
candidates identified from transit searches. We present a method relying only
on transit duration, depth, and period, which require much less precise
photometry to determine accurately. The numerical tool we derive, the exoplanet
diagnostic \eta, is intended to identify the subset of candidates from a
transit search that is most likely to contain exoplanets, and thus most worthy
of subsequent follow-up studies. The effectiveness of the diagnostic is
demonstrated with its success in separating modeled exoplanetary transits and
interlopers, and by applying it to actual OGLE transit candidates.",2005-03-26T02:10:33Z
Large-Scale Velocity Structures in the Horologium-Reticulum Supercluster,"We present 547 optical redshifts obtained for galaxies in the region of the
Horologium-Reticulum Supercluster (HRS) using the 6dF multi-fiber spectrograph
on the UK Schmidt Telescope at the Anglo Australian Observatory. The HRS covers
an area of more than 12deg x 12deg on the sky centered at approximately RA =
03h19m, DEC = -50deg 02amin. Our 6dF observations concentrate upon the
inter-cluster regions of the HRS, from which we describe four primary results.
First, the HRS spans at least the redshift range from 17,000 to 22,500 km s^-1.
Second, the overdensity of galaxies in the inter-cluster regions of the HRS in
this redshift range is estimated to be 2.4, or del rho/ rho ~ 1.4. Third, we
find a systematic trend of increasing redshift along a Southeast-Northwest
(SE-NW) spatial axis in the HRS, in that the mean redshift of HRS members
increases by more than 1500 km s^-1 from SE to NW over a 12 deg region. Fourth,
the HRS is bi-modal in redshift with a separation of ~ 2500 km s^-1 (35 Mpc)
between the higher and lower redshift peaks. This fact is particularly evident
if the above spatial-redshift trend is fitted and removed. In short, the HRS
appears to consist of two components in redshift space, each one exhibiting a
similar systematic spatial-redshift trend along a SE-NW axis. Lastly, we
compare these results from the HRS with the Shapley supercluster and find
similar properties and large-scale features.",2005-05-17T21:13:37Z
Power Spectrum Estimation I. Basics,"This paper and its companion form an extended version of notes provided to
participants in the Valencia September 2004 summer school on Data Analysis in
Cosmology. The papers offer a pedagogical introduction to the problem of
estimating the power spectrum from galaxy surveys. The intention is to focus on
concepts rather than on technical detail, but enough mathematics is provided to
point the student in the right direction.
  This first paper presents background material. It collects some essential
definitions, discusses traditional methods for measuring power, notably the
Feldman-Kaiser-Peacock (1994) method, and introduces Bayesian analysis, Fisher
matrices, and maximum likelihood. For pedagogy and brevity, several derivations
are set as exercises for the reader. At the summer school, multiple choice
questions, included herein, were used to convey some didactic ideas, and
provoked a little lively debate.",2005-03-29T01:38:31Z
INTEGRAL observations of V0332+53 in outburst,"We present the analysis of a 100ksec Integral(3-100kev) observation of the
transient X-ray pulsar V0332+53 inoutburst. The source is pulsating at
P=4.3751+/-0.0002s with a clear double pulse from 6 kev to 60 kev. The average
flux was ~550mCrab between 20 kev and 60 kev. We modeled the broad band
continuum from 5 kev to 100 kev with a power-law modified by an exponential cut
off. We observe three cyclotron lines: the fundamental line at 24.9+/-0.1 kev,
the first harmonic at 50.5+/-0.1 kev as well as the second harmonic
at71.7+/-0.8 kev, thus confirming the discovery of the harmonic lines by Coburn
et al. (2005) in RXTE data.",2005-03-01T21:14:55Z
Kink Stability of Isothermal Spherical Self-Similar Flow Revisited,"The problem of kink stability of isothermal spherical self-similar flow in
newtonian gravity is revisited. Using distribution theory we first develop a
general formula of perturbations, linear or non-linear, which consists of three
sets of differential equations, one in each side of the sonic line and the
other along it. By solving the equations along the sonic line we find
explicitly the spectrum, $k$, of the perturbations, whereby we obtain the
stability criterion for the self-similar solutions. When the solutions are
smoothly across the sonic line, our results reduce to those of Ori and Piran.
To show such obtained perturbations can be matched to the ones in the regions
outside the sonic line, we study the linear perturbations in the external
region of the sonic line (the ones in the internal region are identically
zero), by taking the solutions obtained along the line as the boundary
conditions. After properly imposing other boundary conditions at spatial
infinity, we are able to show that linear perturbations, satisfying all the
boundary conditions, exist and do not impose any additional conditions on $k$.
As a result, the complete treatment of perturbations in the whole spacetime
does not alter the spectrum obtained by considering the perturbations only
along the sonic line.",2005-04-20T20:04:16Z
Optical Monitoring of PKS 1510-089: A Binary Black Hole System?,"Three deep flux minima were observed with nearly the same time-scales and
intervals for the blazar PKS 1510-089 in the past few years. A binary black
hole system was proposed to be at the nucleus of this object, and a new minimum
was predicted to occur in 2002 March. We monitored this source with a 60/90 cm
Schmidt telescope from 2002 February to April. In combination with the data
obtained by Xie et al. (2004) in the same period, we presented for the 2002
minimum a nearly symmetric light curve, which would be required by an eclipsing
model of a binary black hole system. We also constrained the time-scale of the
minimum to be 35 min, which is more consistent with the time-scales ~42 min of
the three previous minima than the 89 min time-scale given by the same authors.
The wiggling miniarcsecond radio jet observed in this object is taken as a
further evidence for the binary black hole system. The `coupling' of the
periodicity in light curve and the helicity in radio jet is discussed in the
framework of a binary black hole system.",2005-04-27T02:19:05Z
The Mass Spectrum of X-Ray Binaries,"This review summarizes the observational constraints on the mass spectrum of
compact objects in X-ray binaries. We currently have 20 X-ray binaries with
confirmed black holes, based on dynamical information (i.e. mass in excess of 3
Msun). In two cases, V404 Cyg and GRS 1915+105, the black hole mass exceeds the
maximum predicted by current Type Ib supernovae models and challenges black
hole formation scenarios. The great majority of black hole binaries are members
of the class of X-ray Transients, where long periods of quiescence enable
spectroscopic studies of the faint donor stars. On the other hand, neutron star
binaries are mostly found in persistent binaries, where reprocessed light from
the accretion disc overwhelms the companion star and precludes mass estimates.
New results, based on the detection of optical fluorescent lines from the donor
star and X-ray burst oscillations, provide the best prospects for mass
constraints of neutron stars in persistent X-ray binaries.",2005-03-03T13:06:55Z
"Polarized Cosmological Gravitational Waves from Primordial Helical
  Turbulence","We show that helical turbulence produced during a first-order phase
transition generates circularly polarized cosmological gravitational waves
(GWs). The characteristic frequency of these GWs for an extreme case of the
phase transition model is around $10^{-3}$ --- $10^{-2}$ Hz with an energy
density parameter as high as $10^{-12}$ --- $10^{-11}$. The possibility of
detection is briefly discussed.",2005-05-31T17:27:50Z
"Temporal Correlation of Hard X-rays and Meter/Decimeter Radio Structures
  in Solar Flares","We investigate the relative timing between hard X-ray (HXR) peaks and
structures in metric and decimetric radio emissions of solar flares using data
from the RHESSI and Phoenix-2 instruments. The radio events under consideration
are predominantly classified as type III bursts, decimetric pulsations and
patches. The RHESSI data are demodulated using special techniques appropriate
for a Phoenix-2 temporal resolution of 0.1s. The absolute timing accuracy of
the two instruments is found to be about 170 ms, and much better on the
average. It is found that type III radio groups often coincide with enhanced
HXR emission, but only a relatively small fraction ($\sim$ 20%) of the groups
show close correlation on time scales $<$ 1s. If structures correlate, the HXRs
precede the type III emissions in a majority of cases, and by 0.69$\pm$0.19 s
on the average. Reversed drift type III bursts are also delayed, but
high-frequency and harmonic emission is retarded less. The decimetric
pulsations and patches (DCIM) have a larger scatter of delays, but do not have
a statistically significant sign or an average different from zero. The time
delay does not show a center-to-limb variation excluding simple propagation
effects. The delay by scattering near the source region is suggested to be the
most efficient process on the average for delaying type III radio emission.",2005-03-07T14:04:07Z
"Multi-wavelength carbon recombination line observations with the VLA
  toward an UCHII region in W48: Physical properties and kinematics of neutral
  material","Using the Very Large Array (VLA) the C76$\alpha$ and C53$\alpha$
recombination lines (RLs) have been detected toward the ultra-compact \HII\
region (UCHII region) G35.20$-$1.74. We also obtained upper limits to the
carbon RLs at 6 cm (C110$\alpha$ & C111$\alpha$) and 3.6 cm (C92$\alpha$)
wavelengths with the VLA. In addition, continuum images of the W48A complex
(which includes G35.20$-$1.74) are made with angular resolutions in the range
14\arcsec to 2\arcsec. Modeling the multi-wavelength line and continuum data
has provided the physical properties of the UCHII region and the
photodissociation region (PDR) responsible for the carbon RL emission. The gas
pressure in the PDR, estimated using the derived physical properties, is at
least four times larger than that in the UCHII region. The dominance of
stimulated emission of carbon RLs near 2 cm, as implied by our models, is used
to study the relative motion of the PDR with respect to the molecular cloud and
ionized gas. Our results from the kinematical study are consistent with a
pressure-confined UCHII region with the ionizing star moving with respect to
the molecular cloud. However, based on the existing data, other models to
explain the extended lifetime and morphology of UCHII regions cannot be ruled
out.",2005-03-03T05:57:16Z
"Pulsar timing and the detection of black hole binary systems in globular
  clusters","The possible existence of intermediate mass binary black holes (IMBBHs) in
globular clusters (GCs) offers a unique geometry in which to detect space-time
oscillations. For certain pulsar-IMBBH configurations possible within a GC, the
usual far-field plane wave approximation for the IMBBH metric perturbation
severely underestimates the magnitude of the induced pulsar pulse
time-of-arrival (TOA) fluctuations. In this letter, the expected TOA
fluctuations induced by an IMBBH lying close to the line-of-sight between a
pulsar and the Earth are calculated for the first time. For an IMBBH consisting
of 10 Msolar and 10^3 Msolar components, a 10 year orbital period, and located
0.1 lyr from the Earth-Pulsar line of sight, the induced pulsar timing residual
amplitude will be of order 5 to 500 ns.",2005-05-29T20:45:47Z
"Solid state components of varying compositions in the outflow of the Red
  Rectangle","We present high resolution Spitzer spectroscopy of several pointings in the
outflow of the Red Rectangle. Besides the resonances due to the C-rich PAHs,
the spectra show a wealth of new emission bands, in particular in the 13-19.5
micron range. We argue that these bands are due to solid state components, and
show that simple oxides of a varying composition show a good match to the data.
The presence of these O-rich species in the supposedly C-rich outflow is
unexplained.",2005-03-04T17:09:35Z
"Hard X-ray and Gamma-ray Emission Induced by Ultra-High Energy Protons
  in Cluster Accretion Shocks","All sufficiently massive clusters of galaxies are expected to be surrounded
by strong accretion shocks, where protons can be accelerated to $\sim
10^{18}$-$10^{19}$ eV under plausible conditions. Such protons interact with
the cosmic microwave background and efficiently produce very high energy
electron-positron pairs, which then radiate synchrotron and inverse Compton
emission, peaking respectively at hard X-ray and TeV gamma-ray energies.
Characterized by hard spectra (photon indices $\sim 1.5$) and spatial
distribution tracing the accretion shock, these can dominate over other
nonthermal components depending on the shock magnetic field. HESS and other
Cerenkov telescopes may detect the TeV emission from nearby clusters,
notwithstanding its extended nature. The hard X-rays may be observable by
future imaging facilities such as NeXT, and possibly also by ASTRO-E2/HXD. Such
detections will not only provide a clear signature of ultra-high energy proton
acceleration, but also an important probe of the accretion shock itself as well
as magnetic fields in the outermost regions of clusters.",2005-05-19T09:43:04Z
The HI content of the Eridanus group of galaxies,"The HI content of galaxies in the Eridanus group is studied using the GMRT
observations and the HIPASS data. A significant HI deficiency up to a factor of
2-3 is observed in galaxies in the high galaxy density regions. The HI
deficiency in galaxies is observed to be directly correlated with the local
projected galaxy density, and inversely correlated with the line-of-sight
radial velocity. Furthermore, galaxies with larger optical diameters are
predominantly in the lower galaxy density regions. It is suggested that the HI
deficiency in Eridanus is due to tidal interactions. In some galaxies,
evidences of tidal interactions are seen. An important implication is that
significant evolution of galaxies can take place in the group environment. In
the hierarchical way of formation of clusters via mergers of groups, a fraction
of the observed HI deficiency in clusters could have originated in groups. The
co-existence of S0's and severely HI deficient galaxies in the Eridanus group
suggests that galaxy harassment is likely to be an effective mechanism for
transforming spirals to S0's.",2005-03-24T14:55:17Z
"Astrophysical Production of Microscopic Black Holes in a Low
  Planck-scale World","In the framework of brane-world models lowering the Planck scale to the TeV
range, it has recently been pointed out that small black holes could be formed
at particle colliders or by neutrinos interactions in the atmosphere. This
article aims at reviewing other places and epochs where microscopic black holes
could be formed : the interstellar medium and the early Universe. The related
decay channels and the propagation of the emitted particles are studied to
conclude that, in spite of the large creation rate for such black holes, the
amount of produced particles do not conflict with experimental data. This
shows, from the astronomical viewpoint, that models with large extra dimensions
making the gravity scale much lower are compatible with observations.",2005-05-20T13:18:34Z
"G313.3+00.3: A New Planetary Nebula discovered by the Australia
  Telescope Compact Array and the Spitzer Space Telescope","We present a new planetary nebula, first identified in images from the
Australia Telescope Compact Array, although not recognized at that time. Recent
observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope during the GLIMPSE Legacy program
have rediscovered the object. The high-resolution radio and infrared images
enable the identification of the central star or its wind, the recognition of
the radio emission as thermal, and the probable presence of polycylic aromatic
hydrocarbons in and around the source. These lead to the conclusion that
G313.3+00.3 is a planetary nebula. This object is of particular interest
because it was discovered solely through radio and mid-infrared imaging,
without any optical (or near-infrared) confirmation, and acts as a proof of
concept for the discovery of many more highly extinguished planetary nebulae.
G313.3+00.3 is well-resolved by both the instruments with which it was
identified, and suffers extreme reddening due to its location in the
Scutum-Crux spiral arm.",2005-03-15T20:49:57Z
"A dichotomy in the orientation of dust and radio jets in nearby
  low-power radio galaxies","We examine the properties of central dust in nearby quiescent and active
early-type galaxies. The active galaxies are low-power radio galaxies with
Fanaroff & Riley Type I or I/II radio jets. We focus on the comparison of the
dust distributions in the active and quiescent galaxy samples and the relation
between the radio jet and dust orientations. Our main observational conclusions
are: (a) radio galaxies contain a higher fraction of regular dust 'ellipses'
compared to quiescent galaxies which contain more often irregular dust
distributions; (b) the morphology, size and orientation of dust ellipses and
lanes in quiescent early-types and active early-types with kpc-scale radio jets
is very similar; (c) dust ellipses are aligned with the major axis of the
galaxy, dust lanes do not show a preferred alignment except for large (>kpc)
dust lanes which are aligned with the minor axis of the galaxy. Dust
morphologies can be classified as regular 'ellipses' and filamentary 'lanes'.
We show that the dust ellipses are consistent with being nearly circular thin
disks viewed at random viewing angles. The lanes are likely warped dust
structures, which may be in the process of settling down to become regular
disks or are being perturbed by a non-gravitational force. We use the observed
dust-jet orientations to constrain the three-dimensional angle $\theta_{\rm
DJ}$ between jet and dust. For dust-lane galaxies, the jet is approximately
perpendicular to the dust structure, while for dust-ellipse galaxies there is a
much wider distribution of $\theta_{\rm DJ}$. We discuss two scenarios that
could explain the dust/jet/galaxy orientation dichotomy. (abridged)",2005-02-03T17:03:29Z
"Cosmological Three-Point Function: Testing The Halo Model Against
  Simulations","We perform detailed comparison of the semi-analytic halo model predictions
with measurements in numerical simulations of the two and three point
correlation functions (3PCF), as well as power spectrum and bispectrum. We
discuss the accuracy and self-consistency of the halo model description of
gravitational clustering in the non-linear regime and constrain halo model
parameters. We exploit the recently proposed multipole expansion of three point
statistics that expresses rotation invariance in the most natural way. This not
only offers technical advantages by reducing the integrals required for the
halo model predictions, but amounts to a convenient way of compressing the
information contained in the 3PCF. We find that, with an appropriate choice of
the halo boundary and mass function cut-off, halo model predictions are in good
agreement with the bispectrum measured in numerical simulations. However, the
halo model predicts less than the observed configuration dependence of the 3PCF
on ~ Mpc scales. This effect is mainly due to quadrupole moment deficit,
possibly related to the assumption of spherical halo geometry. Our analysis
shows that using its harmonic decomposition, the full configuration dependence
of the 3PCF in the non-linear regime can be compressed into just a few numbers,
the lowest multipoles. Moreover, these multipoles are closely related to the
highest signal to noise eigenmodes of the 3PCF. Therefore this estimator may
simplify future analyses aimed at constraining cosmological and halo model
parameters from observational data.",2005-04-13T20:01:19Z
"XBootes: An X-Ray Survey of the NDWFS Bootes Field - Paper I Overview
  and Initial Results","We obtained a 5 ksec deep Chandra X-ray Observatory ACIS-I map of the 9.3
square degree Bootes field of the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey. Here we describe
the data acquisition and analysis strategies leading to a catalog of 4642
(3293) point sources with 2 or more (4 or more) counts, corresponding to a
limiting flux of roughly 4(8)x10^{-15} erg cm^{-2}s^{-1} in the 0.5-7 keV band.
These Chandra XBootes data are unique in that they consitute the widest
contiguous X-ray field yet observed to such a faint flux limit. Because of the
extraordinarily low background of the ACIS, we expect only 14% (0.7%) of the
sources to be spurious. We also detected 43 extended sources in this survey.
The distribution of the point sources among the 126 pointings (ACIS-I has a 16
x 16 arcminute field of view) is consistent with Poisson fluctuations about the
mean of 36.8 sources per pointing. While a smoothed image of the point source
distribution is clumpy, there is no statistically significant evidence of large
scale filamentary structure. We do find however, that for theta>1 arcminute,
the angular correlation function of these sources is consistent with previous
measurements, following a power law in angle with slope -0.7. In a 1.4 deg^{2}
sample of the survey, approximately 87% of the sources with 4 or more counts
have an optical counterpart to R ~26 mag. As part of a larger program of
optical spectroscopy of the NDWFS Bootes area, spectra have been obtained for
\~900 of the X-ray sources, most of which are QSOs or AGN.",2005-04-04T21:17:44Z
Near Infrared Imaging Survey of Bok Globules: Density Structure,"On the basis of near-infrared imaging observations, we derived visual
extinction (Av) distribution toward ten Bok globules through measurements of
both the color excess (E_{H-K}) and the stellar density at J, H, and Ks (star
count). Radial column density profiles for each globule were analyzed with the
Bonnor-Ebert sphere model. Using the data of our ten globules and four globules
in the literature, we investigated the stability of globules on the basis of
xi_max, which characterizes the Bonnor-Ebert sphere as well as the stability of
the equilibrium state against the gravitational collapse. We found that more
than half of starless globules are located near the critical state (xi_max =
6.5 +/- 2). Thus, we suggest that a nearly critical Bonnor-Ebert sphere
characterizes the typical density structure of starless globules. Remaining
starless globules show clearly unstable states (xi_max > 10). Since unstable
equilibrium states are not long maintained, we expect that these globules are
on the way to gravitational collapse or that they are stabilized by non-thermal
support. It was also found that all the star-forming globules show unstable
solutions of xi_max >10, which is consistent with the fact that they have
started gravitational collapse. We investigated the evolution of a collapsing
gas sphere whose initial condition is a nearly critical Bonnor-Ebert sphere. We
found that the column density profiles of the collapsing sphere mimic those of
the static Bonnor-Ebert spheres in unstable equilibrium. The collapsing gas
sphere resembles marginally unstable Bonnor-Ebert spheres for a long time. We
found that the frequency distribution of xi_max for the observed starless
globules is consistent with that from model calculations of the collapsing
sphere.",2005-06-09T14:33:51Z
"A XMM-Newton View of the Soft Gamma-ray Repeater SGR 1806--20: Long Term
  Variability in the pre-Super Giant Flare Epoch","The low energy (<10 keV) X-ray emission of the Soft Gamma-ray Repeater
SGR1806-20 has been studied by means of four XMM-Newton observations carried
out in the last two years, the latter performed in response to a strong
sequence of hard X-ray bursts observed on 2004 October 5. The source was caught
in different states of activity: over the 2003-2004 period the 2-10 keV flux
doubled with respect to the historical level observed previously. The long term
raise in luminosity was accompanied by a gradual hardening of the spectrum,
with the power law photon index decreasing from 2.2 to 1.5, and by a growth of
the bursting activity. The pulse period measurements obtained in the four
observations are consistent with an average spin-down rate of 5.5x10e-10 s/s,
higher than the values observed in the previous years. The long-term behavior
of SGR1806-20 exhibits the correlation between spectral hardness and spin-down
rate previously found only by comparing the properties of different sources
(both SGRs and Anomalous X-ray Pulsars). The best quality spectrum (obtained on
6 September 2004) cannot be fitted by a single power law, but it requires an
additional blackbody component (kT=0.79 keV, R_BB = 1.9 (d/15 kpc)^2 km),
similar to the spectra observed in other SGRs and in Anomalous X-ray Pulsars.
No spectral lines were found in the persistent emission, with equivalent width
upper limits in the range 30-110 eV. Marginal evidence for an absorption
feature at 4.2 keV is present in the cumulative spectrum of 69 bursts detected
in September-October 2004.",2005-02-21T15:49:01Z
CCD photometry of 23 minor planets,"We present CCD photometric observations of 23 main-belt asteroids, of which 8
have never been observed before thus the data of these objects are the first in
the literature. The majority showed well detectable light variations, exceeding
0.1 mag. We have determined synodic periods for 756 Lilliana (9.36h), 1270
Datura (3.4h), 1400 Tirela (13.36h), 1503 Kuopio (9.98h), 3682 Welther (3.59h),
7505 Furushu (4.14h) and 11436 1969 QR (2.6h), while uncertain period estimates
were possible for 469 Argentina (12.3h), 546 Herodias (10.4h) and 1026 Ingrid
(5.3h). The shape of the lightcurves of 3682 Welther changed on a short
time-scale and showed dimmings that might be attributed to eclipses in a binary
system. For the remaining objects, only lower limits of the periods and
amplitudes were concluded.",2005-04-21T08:07:48Z
"Gravitational Radiation from an Accreting Millisecond Pulsar with a
  Magnetically Confined Mountain","The amplitude of the gravitational radiation from an accreting neutron star
undergoing polar magnetic burial is calculated. During accretion, the magnetic
field of a neutron star is compressed into a narrow belt at the magnetic
equator by material spreading equatorward from the polar cap. In turn, the
compressed field confines the accreted material in a polar mountain which is
misaligned with the rotation axis in general, producing gravitational waves.
The equilibrium hydromagnetic structure of the polar mountain, and its
associated mass quadrupole moment, are computed as functions of the accreted
mass, M_a, by solving a Grad-Shafranov boundary value problem. The orientation-
and polarization-averaged gravitational wave strain, h_c ~ 6e-24 for a 0.6 kHz
source at 1 kpc with M_a > 10^-5 M_Sun, exceeds previous estimates that failed
to treat equatorward spreading and flux freezing self-consistently. It is
concluded that an accreting millisecond pulsar emits a persistent, sinusoidal
gravitational wave signal at levels detectable, in principle, by long baseline
interferometers after phase-coherent integration, provided that the polar
mountain is hydromagnetically stable. Magnetic burial also reduces the magnetic
dipole moment, mu, monotonically, implying a novel, observationally testable
scaling h_c(mu). The implications for the rotational evolution of (accreting)
X-ray and (isolated) radio millisecond pulsars are explored.",2005-03-14T09:22:34Z
Limits on stochastic magnetic fields: A defense of our paper [1],"In their recent paper ``Faraday rotation of the cosmic microwave background

Rev. D65, 023517 (2002)], in which we derived very strong limits on the
amplitude of a primordial magnetic field from gravitational wave production.
They argue that our limits are erroneous. In this short comment we defend our

A Physical Model for the Origin of Quasar Lifetimes,"We propose a model of quasar lifetimes in which observational quasar
lifetimes and an intrinsic lifetime of rapid accretion are strongly
distinguished by the physics of obscuration by surrounding gas and dust.
Quasars are powered by gas funneled to galaxy centers, but for a large part of
the accretion lifetime are heavily obscured by the large gas densities powering
accretion. In this phase, starbursts and black hole growth are fueled but the
quasar is buried. Eventually, feedback from accretion energy disperses
surrounding gas, creating a window in which the black hole is observable
optically as a quasar, until accretion rates drop below those required to
maintain a quasar luminosity. We model this process and measure the unobscured
and intrinsic quasar lifetimes in a hydrodynamical simulation of a major galaxy
merger. The source luminosity is determined from the black hole accretion rate,
calculated from local gas properties. We calculate the column density of
hydrogen to the source along multiple lines of sight and use these column
densities and gas metallicities to determine B-band attenuation of the source.
Defining the observable quasar lifetime as the total time with an observed
B-band luminosity above some limit L_B,min, we find lifetimes ~10-20 Myr for
L_B,min=10^11 L_sun (M_B=-23), in good agreement with observationally
determined quasar lifetimes. This is significantly smaller than the intrinsic
lifetime ~100 Myr obtained if attenuation is neglected. The ratio of observed
to intrinsic lifetime is also strong function of both the limiting luminosity
and the observed frequency.",2005-02-11T21:12:53Z
A new reduction of the raw Hipparcos data,"We present an outline of a new reduction of the Hipparcos astrometric data,
the justifications of which are described in the accompanying paper. The
emphasis is on those aspects of the data analysis that are fundamentally
different from the ones used for the catalogue published in 1997. The new
reduction uses a dynamical modelling of the satellite's attitude. It
incorporates provisions for scan-phase discontinuities and hits, most of which
have now been identified. Solutions for the final along-scan attitude (the
reconstruction of the satellite's scan phase), the abscissa corrections and the
instrument model, originally solved simultaneously in the great-circle
solution, are now de-coupled. This is made possible by starting the solution
iterations with the astrometric data from the published catalogue. The
de-coupling removes instabilities that affected great-circle solutions for
short data sets in the published data. The modelling-noise reduction implies
smaller systematic errors, which is reflected in a reduction of the
abscissa-error correlations by about a factor 40. Special care is taken to
ensure that measurements from both fields of view contribute significantly to
the along-scan attitude solution. This improves the overall connectivity of the
data and rigidity of the reconstructed sky, which is of critical importance to
the reliability of the astrometric data. The changes in the reduction process
and the improved understanding of the dynamics of the satellite result in
considerable formal-error reductions for stars brighter than 8th magnitude.",2005-05-20T09:19:26Z
"Asymptotic behavior of Cardassian cosmologies with exponential
  potentials","In this paper we analyze the asymptotic behavior of Cardassian cosmological
models filled with a perfect fluid and a scalar field with an exponential
potential. Cardassian cosmologies arise from modifications of the Friedmann
equation, and among the different proposals within that framework we will
choose those of the form $3H^2-\rho\propto \rho^n$ with $n<1$. We construct two
three dimensional dynamical systems arising from the evolution equations,
respectively adapted for studying the high and low energy limits. Using
standard dynamical systems techniques we find the fixed points and characterize
the solutions they represent. We pay especial attention to the properties
inherent to the modifications and compare with the (standard) unmodified
scenario. Among other interesting results, we find there are no late-time
tracking attractors.",2005-03-22T16:31:01Z
2dFGRS and SDSS Galaxy Group Density Profiles,"We have analysed the distribution of galaxies in groups identified in the
largest redshift surveys at the present: the final release of the 2dF Galaxy
Redshift Survey and the first release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our work
comprises the study of the galaxy density profiles and the fraction of galaxies
per spectral type as a function of the group-centric distance. We have
calculated the projected galaxy density profiles of galaxy groups using
composite samples in order to increase the statistical significance of the
results. Special cares have been taken in order to avoid possible biases in the
group identification and the construction of the projected galaxy density
profile estimator. The results show that the projected galaxy density profiles
obtained for both redshift surveys are in agreement with a projected Navarro,
Frenk & White predictions in the range $0.15< r/r_{200}
  < 1$, whereas a good fit for the measured profiles in the whole range of
$r/r_{200}$ is given by a projected King profile. We have adopted a generalized
King profile to fit the measured projected density profiles per spectral type.
In order to infer the 3-D galaxy density profiles, we deproject the 2-D density
profiles using a deprojection method similar to the developed by Allen &
Fabian. From 2-D and 3-D galaxy density profiles we have estimated the
corresponding galaxy fractions per spectral type. The 2-D fraction of galaxies
computed using the projected profiles show a similar segregation of galaxy
spectral types as the obtained by Dom\'{\i}nguez et al. for groups in the early
data release of the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. As expected, the trends
obtained for the 3-D galaxy fractions show steeper slopes than the observed in
the 2-D fractions.",2005-04-20T21:13:31Z
"A Comparison of Stellar and Gaseous Kinematics in the Nuclei of Active
  Galaxies","To investigate the relationship between black holes and their host galaxies,
many groups have used the width of the [O III] 5007 line as a substitute for
the stellar velocity dispersion (sigma*) of galaxy bulges. We directly test
this assumption with a large and homogeneous sample of narrow-line active
galactic nuclei from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We consider multiple
transitions ([O II] 3727, [O III] 5007, and [S II] 6716, 6731) and various
techniques for quantifying the line width in order to obtain a calibration
between the gas velocity dispersion, sigma_g, and sigma*. We find that sigma_g
of the low-ionization lines traces sigma*, as does sigma_g for the core of [O
III] after its asymmetric blue wing is properly removed, although in all cases
the correlation between sigma_g and sigma* has considerable scatter. While the
gas kinematics of the narrow-line region of active galaxies are primarily
governed by the gravitational potential of the stars, the accretion rate, as
traced by the Eddington luminosity ratio, seems to play an important secondary
role. Departures from virial motions correlate systematically with accretion
rate. We discuss the implications of these results for previous studies that
use [O III] line widths to infer stellar velocity dispersions in quasars and
narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies.",2005-03-30T21:02:32Z
"Saturated-State Turbulence and Structure from Thermal and
  Magnetorotational Instability in the ISM: Three-Dimensional Numerical
  Simulations","This paper reports on 3D numerical simulations of dynamics and thermodynamics
in the diffuse ISM. Our models are local, account for sheared galactic
rotation, magnetic fields, and realistic cooling, and resolve scales ~1-200 pc.
This combination permits the study of quasi-steady turbulence in a cloudy
medium representing the warm/cold atomic ISM. Turbulence is driven by the
magnetorotational instability (MRI); our models are the first to study the
saturated state of MRI under strongly inhomogeneous conditions, with
cloud/intercloud contrasts of about 100. For volume-averaged densities n=0.25 -
4 cm^3, the saturated-state velocity dispersion ranges from 8-1 km/s, scaling
as n^-0.77. The MRI is therefore likely quite important in driving turbulence
in low-density ISM regions, both at high latitudes in the inner Galaxy,and
throughout the far outer Galaxy. The MRI may be key to suppressing star
formation at large radii in spiral galaxies, where without MRI-driven
turbulence, a thin, cold layer could form and become gravitationally instable.
Our presentation also includes analysis of thermal structure (temperature and
density PDFs are broadened and include extreme departures from equilibrium, but
retain the classical two-phase bimodal character); results on the distribution
of clump masses (the mass spectrum peaks at about 100 solar masses);
comparisons of saturated-state MRI scalings with single-phase simulation
results (we find B^2 is independent of n); and examples of synthetic HI line
profile maps (showing that physical clumps are not easily distinguished in
velocity components, and vice versa).",2005-04-29T17:50:13Z
Semi-empiric Radiative Transfer Modeling of FUSE Stellar Spectra,"We present an overview of radiative transfer modeling efforts to interpret
spectra of a variety of stellar objects observed with FUSE. Detailed radiative
transfer modeling of high ion emission line profiles of C III and O VI observed
in the far-UV spectrum provides a powerful means to probe the thermal and
dynamic properties of high-temperature plasmas in the atmospheres of stars. We
model asymmetric emission lines of C III lam977 observed in spectra of luminous
cool stars such as Alpha Aqr, to infer the wind- and microturbulence velocity
structures of the upper chromosphere. Semi-empiric radiative transfer models
that include transition region temperature conditions, are further developed
based on detailed fits to O VI resonance emission lines in the supergiant Alpha
Aqr, the classical Cepheid variable Beta Dor, and to self-absorbed O VI
emission lines in the cataclysmic variable SW UMa.
  We observe that the C III resonance line profile of Alpha Aqr assumes a
remarkable asymmetric shape, reminiscent of P Cygni type profiles observed in
hot luminous supergiants. The model calculations indicate outflow velocities
above ~140 km/s at kinetic temperatures of 65 kK and higher. Based on detailed
model fits to the narrow red-shifted and self-absorbed O VI emission lines of
SW UMa we compute that the gas- and electron-density exceed the density
conditions of the upper solar transition region by about three orders of
magnitude. We discuss how detailed semi-empiric fits to emission lines observed
with the high spectral resolution of FUSE can provide reliable constraints on
the mass-loss or mass-accretion rates in these objects.",2005-04-24T03:43:41Z
Ultrahigh Energy Activity in Giant Magnetar Outbursts,"The recent superflare of 27 December 2004 from the magnetar SGR 1806-20 was
the brightest extrasolar flash ever recorded in the modern era. The chances for
seeing exotic ultrahigh energy (UHE) radiation - neutrons, neutrinos, gamma
rays and charged cosmic rays - from it are far better from an energetic point
of view than from cosmological gamma ray bursts (GRBs). The chances for
detecting the various components are discussed in light of recent data from the
27 December event.",2005-04-20T20:10:47Z
"Observation and modeling of anomalous CN polarization profiles produced
  by the molecular Paschen-Back effect in sunspots","We report novel spectropolarimetric observations of sunspots carried out with
the Tenerife Infrared Polarimeter (TIP) in a near-IR spectral region around
15410 A, which is known to contain two groups of prominent OH lines that show
circular polarization signals of opposite polarity. Surrounding these
well-known OH lines, we have discovered the presence of CN lines of the $\Delta
v=1$ band which show anomalous polarization profiles. Although the Stokes V
signals of the OH lines are antisymmetric and with a sizable amplitude, the CN
lines show almost negligible circular polarization. On the contrary, the linear
polarization signals turn out to be much stronger in the CN lines than in the
OH lines. Interestingly, these CN lines present striking antisymmetric linear
polarization profiles, which we are able to explain and model via the
Paschen-Back effect theory for diatomic molecules. The presence of such
peculiar CN lines in the same spectral region of the OH lines may be useful to
improve our empirical knowledge of solar magnetic fields via the simultaneous
observation and modeling of the transverse and longitudinal Zeeman effects in
two different molecular species.",2005-05-04T15:48:17Z
A Brighter Past: Galaxy Luminosity Function At High Redshifts,"Using the conditional luminosity function -- the luminosity distribution of
galaxies in a dark matter halo as a function of the halo mass -- we present an
empirical model to describe the redshift evolution of the rest B-band galaxy
luminosity function (LF). The model is compared to measured LFs out to a
redshift of 3.5, including LFs of galaxy types separated to red and blue
galaxies. The increase in the number density of luminous galaxies, at the
bright-end of the LF, can be explained as due to a brightening of the
luminosity of galaxies present in dark matter halo centers, relative to the
luminosity of central galaxies in similar mass halos today. The lack of strong
evolution in the faint-end of the LF, however, argues against a model involving
pure luminosity evolution at all halo mass scales. The increase in luminosity
at the bright-end compensates the rapid decline in the number density of
massive halos as the redshift is increased. The decline in group to
cluster-mass dark matter halos out to a redshift of ~ 2 is not important as the
central galaxy luminosity flattens at halo masses around 10^13 M_sun At
redshifts ~ 2 to 3, however, the density of bright galaxies begins to decrease
due to the rapid decline in the number density of dark matter halos at mass
scales around and below 10^13 M_sun. We compare our predictions to the UV LF of
galaxies at redshifts 3 to 6 and the galaxy clustering bias measurements at
redshifts ~ 3, and use our models to establish the dark matter halo mass scales
of galaxies observed at high redshifts. In general, to explain high-redshift
LFs, galaxies in dark matter halos around 10^12 M_sun must increase in
luminosity by a factor of ~ 4 to 6 between today and redshift of 6.",2005-06-04T00:35:50Z
E = mc^2 Without Relativity,"The equivalence of mass and energy is indelibly linked with relativity, both
by scientists and in the popular mind. I prove that E = mc^2 by demanding
momentum conservation of an object that emits two equal electromagnetic wave
packets in opposite directions in its own frame. In contrast to Einstein's
derivation of this equation, which applies energy conservation to a similar
thought experiment, the new derivation employs no effects that are greater than
first order in v/c and therefore does not rely on results from Special
Relativity. In addition to momentum conservation, it uses only aberration of
starlight and the electromagnetic-wave momentum-energy relation p=E/c, both of
which were established by 1884. In particular, no assumption is made about the
constancy of the speed of light, and the derivation proceeds equally well if
one assumes that light is governed by a Galilean transformation. In view of
this, it is somewhat puzzling that the equivalence of mass and energy was not
derived well before the advent of Special Relativity. The new derivation is
simpler and more transparent than Einstein's and is therefore pedagogically
useful.",2005-04-22T15:57:24Z
All-sky Relative Opacity Mapping Using Night Time Panoramic Images,"An all-sky cloud monitoring system that generates relative opacity maps over
many of the world's premier astronomical observatories is described.
Photometric measurements of numerous background stars are combined with
simultaneous sky brightness measurements to differentiate thin clouds from sky
glow sources such as air glow and zodiacal light. The system takes a continuous
pipeline of all-sky images, and compares them to canonical images taken on
other nights at the same sidereal time. Data interpolation then yields
transmission maps covering almost the entire sky. An implementation of this
system is currently operating through the Night Sky Live network of CONCAM3s
located at Cerro Pachon (Chile), Mauna Kea (Hawaii), Haleakala (Hawaii), SALT
(South Africa) and the Canary Islands (Northwestern Africa).",2005-06-15T19:35:57Z
Lyman Break Galaxies at z = 4 - 6 in cosmological SPH Simulations,"We perform a spectrophotometric analysis of galaxies at redshifts z = 4 - 6
in cosmological SPH simulations of a Lambda CDM universe. Our models include
radiative cooling and heating by a uniform UV background, star formation,
supernova feedback, and a phenomenological model for galactic winds. Analysing
a series of simulations of varying boxsize and particle number allows us to
isolate the impact of numerical resolution on our results. Specifically, we
determine the luminosity functions in B, V, R, i', and z' filters, and compare
the results with observed galaxy surveys done with the Subaru telescope and the
Hubble Space Telescope. We find that the simulated galaxies have UV colours
consistent with observations and fall in the expected region of the
colour-colour diagrams used by the Subaru group. Assuming a uniform extinction
of E(B-V) = 0.15, we also find reasonable agreement between simulations and
observations in the space density of UV bright galaxies at z = 3 - 6, down to
the magnitude limit of each survey. For the same moderate extinction level of
E(B-V) ~ 0.15, the simulated luminosity functions match observational data, but
have a steep faint-end slope with alpha ~ -2.0. We discuss the implications of
the steep faint-end slope found in the simulations.",2005-03-30T19:17:29Z
Helium self--enrichment and the second parameter problem in M3 and M13,"Inspection of the CM diagrams of globular clusters having similar heavy
element content shows that the luminosity of the red giant bump relative to the
turnoff (Delta V_{TO}^{bump}) differs by more than 0.1 mag between clusters
with different horizontal branch morphology. Unfortunately, careful
consideration of the data leaves us with only one pair (M3 and M13) of clusters
good for a quantitative discussion. For this pair we consider differences in
age and helium content as possible causes for the difference in Delta
V_{TO}^{bump}, and find more convincing support for the latter. A larger helium
content in M13 stars (Y~0.28 vs. Y~0.24) accounts for various CM diagram
features, such as the difference in the luminosity level of RR Lyr variables
and of the red giant bump with respect to the turnoff luminosity, and the
horizontal branch morphology. This enhanced helium can be tentatively
understood in the framework of self--enrichment by massive asymptotic giant
branch stars in the first ~100 Myr of the cluster life. A modest
self--enrichment can be present also in M3 and can be the reason for the still
unexplained presence of a not negligible number of luminous, Oosterhoff II type
RR Lyr variables. The hypothesis that a larger helium content is the second
parameter for clusters with very blue horizontal branch morphology could be
checked by an accurate set of data for more clusters giving turnoff, RR Lyrs
and bump magnitudes within a unique photometry.",2005-02-09T17:14:58Z
"Upper limits to the SN1006 multi-TeV gamma-ray flux from H.E.S.S.
  observations","Observations of the shell-type supernova remnant SN1006 have been carried out
with the H.E.S.S. system of Cherenkov telescopes during 2003 (18.2h with two
operating telescopes) and 2004 (6.3h with all four telescopes). No evidence for
TeV gamma-ray emission from any compact or extended region associated with the
remnant is seen and resulting upper limits at the 99.9% confidence level are up
to a factor 10 lower than previously-published fluxes from CANGAROO. For SN1006
at its current epoch of evolution we give limits for a number of important
global parameters. Upper limits on the gamma-ray luminosity (for E=0.26 to 10
TeV, distance d=2 kpc) of L_gamma < 1.7x10^{33} erg s^{-1}, and the total
energy in corresponding accelerated protons, W_p<1.6\times 10^{50} erg (for
proton energies E_p \sim 1.5 to 60 TeV and assuming the lowest value n=0.05
cm^{-3} of the ambient target density discussed in literature) are estimated.
Extending this estimate to cover the range of proton energies observed in the
cosmic ray spectrum up to the knee (we take here E_p ~ 1 GeV to 3 PeV, assuming
a differential particle index -2) gives W_p<6.3x10^{50} erg. A lower limit on
the post-shock magnetic field of B>25microG results when considering the
synchrotron/inverse-Compton framework for the observed X-ray flux and gamma-ray
upper limits.",2005-02-11T19:58:48Z
Radio Detection of Cosmic Ray Air Showers with Codalema,"Studies of the radio detection of Extensive Air Showers is the goal of the

Formation of HD molecules in merging dark matter haloes,"HD molecules can be an important cooling agent of the primordial gas behind
the shock waves originated through mergings of the dark matter haloes at epochs
when first luminous objects were to form. We study the necessary conditions for
the HD cooling to switch on in the low temperature range $T<200$ K. We show
that these conditions are fulfiled in merging haloes with the total (dark
matter and baryon) mass in excess of $M_{\rm cr}\sim 10^7[(1+z)/20]^{-2}\msun$.
Haloes with masses $M>M_{\rm cr}$ may be the sites of low-mass star formation.",2005-05-31T11:28:48Z
Faint Fuzzies and the Formation of Lenticular Galaxies,"We investigate the dynamical state of a new class of extended star clusters,
known as ""Faint Fuzzies"", that were discovered in two nearby S0 galaxies, NGC
1023 and NGC 3384. It is shown that the Faint Fuzzies of NGC 1023 lie in a fast
rotating ring-like structure within the galactic disk with mean radius of 5
kpc, rotational velocity of 200 km/s and velocity dispersion of 115 km/s. We
propose a scenario for the origin of Faint Fuzzies that is connected to the
origin of S0 galaxies as a result of galaxy-galaxy interactions in dense
environments. As is apparent in the Cartwheel galaxy, and is confirmed by
numerical simulations, the passage of a small galaxy through, or close to, the
center of a disk galaxy can form a ring of clumpy star formation with a radius
comparable to the Faint Fuzzy ring radius in NGC 1023. In this case, the Faint
Fuzzies are signposts for the transformation of spiral galaxies into
lenticulars via such interactions.",2005-04-04T12:52:37Z
"Low energy conversion electron detection in superfluid He3 at ultra-low
  temperature","We report on the first results of the MACHe3 (MAtrix of Cells of Helium 3)
prototype experiment concerning the measurement of low energy conversion
electrons at ultra-low temperature. For the first time, the feasibility of the
detection of low energy electrons is demonstrated in superfluid He3-B cooled
down to 100 microK. Low energy electrons at 7.3 keV coming from the K shell
conversion of the 14.4 keV nuclear transition of a low activity Co57 source are
detected, opening the possibility to use a He3-based detector for the detection
of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) which are expected to release
an amount of energy higher-bounded by 5.6 keV.",2005-04-12T14:46:06Z
Frequency dependence of the drifting subpulses of PSR B0031-07,"The well known drifter PSR B0031-07 is known to exhibit drifting subpulses
where the spacing between the drift bands (P_3) shows three distinct modes A, B
and C corresponding to 12, 6 and 4 seconds respectively. We have investigated
periodicities and polarisation properties of PSR B0031-07 for a sequence of
2700 single pulses taken simultaneously at 328 MHz and 4.85 GHz. We found that
mode A occurs simultaneously at these frequencies, while modes B and C only
occur at 328 MHz. However, when the pulsar is emitting in mode B at the lower
frequency there is still emission at the higher frequency, hinting towards the
presence of mode B emission at a weaker level. Further, we have established
that modes A and B are associated with two orthogonal modes of polarisation,
respectively. Based on these observations, we suggest a geometrical model where
modes A and B at a given frequency are emitted in two concentric rings around
the magnetic axis with mode B being nested inside mode A. Further, it is
evident that this nested configuration is preserved across frequency with the
higher frequency arising closer to the stellar surface compared to the lower
one, consistent with the well known radius-to-frequency mapping operating in
pulsars.",2005-06-13T08:40:09Z
"de Vaucouleurs-Ikeuchi Diagram and Commutation Relations among Phase
  Space Coordinates","We consider the relations between de Vaucouleurs-Ikeuchi diagram and
generalized commutation relations among the coordinates and momenta. All
physical objects in the Universe ranging from elementary particles to super
cluster of galaxies are confined within the Triangle of the de
Vaucouleurs-Ikeuchi diagram on the matter density versus scale length plane.
These three boundaries are characterized by the quantum uncertainty principle,
gravitational event horizon, and cosmological constant. These are specified by
the non-zero commutation relations $[x_\mu,p_\nu], [x_\mu, x_\nu]$ (strictly
$[x_i,t]$) and $[p_\mu,p_\nu]$, respectively. The canonical commutation
relation $[x_i,p_j]$ are slightly modified, which preserves the self
consistency as a whole.",2005-04-23T03:48:34Z
Atmospheric dynamics in carbon-rich Miras. II. Models meet observations,"Originating in different depths of the very extended atmospheres of AGB
stars, various molecular spectral lines observable in the near-infrared show
diverse behaviours and can be used to probe atmospheric dynamics throughout the
outer layers of these pulsating red giants. In Nowotny et al. (2005, Paper I)
time series of synthetic high-resolution spectra were presented, computed from
a dynamic model atmosphere for a typical carbon-rich Mira. In this work, line
profile shapes, their variations during the lightcycle and radial velocities
derived from wavelength shifts are analyzed and compared with results from
observed FTS spectra of the C-rich Mira S Cep and other Miras. It is found that
the global velocity structure of the model is in qualitative agreement with
observations. Radial velocities of molecular lines sampling different layers
behave comparably, although some differences are apparant concerning absolute
values. A correction factor of p=1.36 between measured RVs and actual gas
velocities is derived for CO dv=3 lines. It is shown that dynamic model
atmospheres are capable of reproducing Mira spectra without introducing an
additional ''static layer'' proposed by several authors.",2005-03-30T12:43:37Z
An asteroseismic test of diffusion theory in white dwarfs,"The helium-atmosphere (DB) white dwarfs are commonly thought to be the
descendants of the hotter PG1159 stars, which initially have uniform He/C/O
atmospheres. In this evolutionary scenario, diffusion builds a pure He surface
layer which gradually thickens as the star cools. In the temperature range of
the pulsating DB white dwarfs (T_eff ~ 25,000 K) this transformation is still
taking place, allowing asteroseismic tests of the theory. We have obtained
dual-site observations of the pulsating DB star CBS114, to complement existing
observations of the slightly cooler star GD358. We recover the 7 independent
pulsation modes that were previously known, and we discover 4 new ones to
provide additional constraints on the models. We perform objective global
fitting of our updated double-layered envelope models to both sets of
observations, leading to determinations of the envelope masses and pure He
surface layers that qualitatively agree with the expectations of diffusion
theory. These results provide new asteroseismic evidence supporting one of the
central assumptions of spectral evolution theory, linking the DB white dwarfs
to PG1159 stars.",2005-02-07T21:52:03Z
Early star formation in the Galaxy from beryllium and oxygen abundances,"We investigate the evolution of the star formation rate in the early Galaxy
using beryllium and oxygen abundances in metal poor stars. Specifically, we
show that stars belonging to two previously identified kinematical classes (the
so-called ``accretion'' and ``dissipative'' populations) are neatly separated
in the [O/Fe] vs. Log(Be/H) diagram. The dissipative population follows the
predictions of our model of Galactic evolution for the thick disk component,
suggesting that the formation of this stellar population occurred on a
timescale significantly longer (by a factor ~5-10) than the accretion
component. The latter shows a large scatter in the [O/Fe] vs. Log(Be/H)
diagram, probably resulting from the inhomogeneous enrichment in oxygen and
iron of the protogalactic gas. Despite the limitation of the sample, the data
suggest that the combined use of products of spallation reactions (like
beryllium) and elemental ratios of stellar nucleosynthesis products (like
[O/Fe]) can constrain theoretical models for the formation and early evolution
of our Galaxy.",2005-05-19T07:41:32Z
"Radio, millimeter and optical monitoring of GRB030329 afterglow:
  Constraining the double jet model","We present radio, millimeter and optical observations of the afterglow of
GRB030329. UBVR_{C}I_{C} photometry is presented for a period of 3 hours to 34
days after the burst. Radio monitoring at 1280 MHz has been carried out using
the GMRT for more than a year. Simultaneous millimeter observations at 90 GHz
and 230 GHz have been obtained from the Swedish-ESO Submillimeter Telescope
(SEST) and the IRAM-PdB interferometer over more than a month following the
burst. We use these data to constrain the double jet model proposed by Berger
et al. (2003) for this afterglow. We also examine whether instead of the two
jets being simultaneously present, the wider jet could result from the
initially narrow jet, due to a fresh supply of energy from the central engine
after the ``jet break''.",2005-06-08T13:50:31Z
"Statistical characteristics of observed Ly-$α$ forest and the shape
  of linear power spectrum","Properties of $\sim$ 6 000 Ly-$\alpha$ absorbers observed in 19 high
resolution spectra of QSOs are investigated using the model of formation and
evolution of DM structure elements based on the Zel'dovich theory. This model
asserts that absorbers are formed in the course of both linear and nonlinear
adiabatic or shock compression of dark matter (DM) and gaseous matter. It
allows us to link the column density and overdensity of DM and gaseous
components with the observed column density of neutral hydrogen, redshifts and
Doppler parameters of absorbers and demonstrates that at high redshifts we
observe a self similar period of structure evolution with the Gaussian initial
perturbations. We show that the colder absorbers are associated with rapidly
expanded regions of a galactic scale which represent large amplitude negative
density perturbations.
  We extend and improve the method of measuring the power spectrum of initial
perturbations proposed in Demia\'nski & Doroshkevich (2003b). Our method links
the observed separations and the DM column density of absorbers with the
correlation function of the initial velocity field. We recover the cold dark
matter (CDM) like power spectrum at scales 10> D > 0.15Mpc/h with a precision
of ~15%. However at scales $\sim 3 - 150 h^{-1}$kpc the measured and CDM--like
spectra are different. This result suggests a possible complex inflation with
generation of excess power at small scales.",2005-06-02T14:17:52Z
The E_{peak}^{rest} -E_{rad} correlation in GRBs in the BATSE catalog,"The energy emission involved in a Gamma-Ray Burst evidently can be estimated
only provided that we know the distance to the source. The same is true for the
peak energy of the event in the source rest frame. Redshifts have been actually
measured only for about 40 events. In order to check if it is possible to
extend the $E_{peak}^{rest}$ - $E_{rad}$ relation originally found by
\citet{Am02} to a larger number of events, we make use of the pseudo-redshift
estimate proposed by \citet{Att03} and of the spectra published by
\citet{Band93}. We thus obtain a completely independent set of events which
indeed follows the same $E_{peak}^{rest}$ - $E_{rad}$ relation and confirms it.",2005-03-11T15:16:46Z
A test for the universality of extinction curve shape,"We present an analysis of 436 lines of sight with extinction data covering
wavelength range from near-infrared (NIR) to ultraviolet (UV). We use J, H, K
photometry from 2MASS database, the IR intrinsic colors from Wegner (1994), and
UV extinction data from Wegner (2002). We exclude 19 lines of sight (4%) from
the original sample because of suspected photometric problems. We derive total
to selective extinction ratios (R_V) based on the Cardelli, Clayton, and Mathis
(1989; CCM) law, which is typically used to fit the extinction data for both
diffuse and dense interstellar medium. We conclude that CCM law is able to fit
well most of the extinction curves in our sample (71%), and we present a
catalog of R_V and visual extinction (A_V) values for those cases. We divide
the remaining lines of sight with peculiar extinction into two groups according
to two main behaviors: a) the NIR or/and UV wavelength regions cannot be
reproduced by CCM formula (14% of the entire sample), b) the NIR and UV
extinction data taken separately are best fit by CCM laws with significantly
different values of R_V (10% of the entire sample). We present examples of such
curves. We caution that some peculiarities of the extinction curves may not be
intrinsic but simply caused by faulty data. The study of the intrinsically
peculiar cases could help us to learn about the physical processes that affect
dust in the interstellar medium, e.g., formation of mantles on the surface of
grains, evaporation, growing or shattering.",2005-02-25T15:47:51Z
Properties of Extremely Red Objects in an Overdense Region,"We use a serendipitously discovered overdensity of extremely red objects
(EROs) to study the morphologies and cumulative surface number density of EROs
in a dense environment. Our extremely deep imaging allows us to select very
faint EROs, reaching Ks=21, or ~2 magnitudes fainter than the L* of passively
evolving ellipticals at z=1.5. We find that the shape of the ERO cumulative
surface number density in our overdense field mimics that of the field ERO
population over all magnitudes down to Ks=21 but with a factor of 3-4 higher
normalization. The excellent seeing in our images (0.4"" in Ks and 0.6"" in R)
allows for morphological classification of the brighter (Ks<19) EROs and we
find a mix of morphologies including interacting systems and disks; the
fraction of pure bulges (at most 38%), galaxies with disks (at least 46%), and
interacting systems (at least 21%) is consistent with morphological fractions
in field ERO studies. The similarity in the shape of the cumulative surface
density and morphological mix between our overdense field and the field ERO
population suggests that ERO galaxies in overdense regions at z~1-2 may not
have had an appreciably different history than those in the field.",2005-03-23T23:24:37Z
"Tentative Identification of Interstellar Dust in the Nose of the
  Heliosphere","Observations of the weak polarization of light from nearby stars, reported by
Tinbergen (1982), are consistent with polarization by small, radius <0.14
microm, interstellar dust grains entrained in the magnetic wall of the
heliosphere. The direction of maximum polarization is offset by ~35 deg from
the heliosphere nose, and extends to low ecliptic latitudes. An offset is found
between the direction of the best aligned dust grains, and the upwind direction
of the undeflected large interstellar grains seen by Ulysses and Galileo. In
the aligned-grain region, the strength of polarization anti-correlates with
ecliptic latitude, indicating that the magnetic wall is predominantly at
negative ecliptic latitudes, which is consistent with predictions of Linde
(1998). These data are consistent with an interstellar magnetic field tilt of
60 deg with respect to the ecliptic plane, and parallel to the galactic plane.
Interstellar dust grains captured in the heliosheath may also introduce a weak,
but important, large scale contaminant for the cosmic microwave background
signal with a symmetry consistent with the relative tilts of \Bis and the
ecliptic.",2005-06-13T22:30:30Z
"The Propeller Regime of Disk Accretion to a Rapidly Rotating Magnetized
  Star","The propeller regime of disk accretion to a rapidly rotating magnetized star
is investigated here for the first time by axisymmetric 2.5D
magnetohydrodynamic simulations. An expanded, closed magnetosphere forms in
which the magnetic field is predominantly toroidal. A smaller fraction of the
star's poloidal magnetic flux inflates vertically, forming a magnetically
dominated tower. Matter accumulates in the equatorial region outside
magnetosphere and accretes to the star quasi-periodically through elongated
funnel streams which cause the magnetic field to reconnect. The star spins-down
owing to the interaction of the closed magnetosphere with the disk. For the
considered conditions, the spin-down torque varies with the angular velocity of
the star omega* as omega*^1.3 for fixed mass accretion rate. The propeller
stage may be important in the evolution of X-ray pulsars, cataclysmic variables
and young stars. In particular, it may explain the present slow rotation of the
classical T Tauri stars.",2005-02-14T15:36:05Z
"Asteroseismology of the planet-hosting star mu Arae. II. Seismic
  analysis","As most exoplanets host stars, HD 160691 (alias mu Ara) presents a
metallicity excess in its spectrum compared to stars without detected planets.
This excess may be primordial, in which case the star would be completely
overmetallic, or it may be due to accretion in the early phases of planetary
formation, in which case it would be overmetallic only in its outer layers. As
discussed in a previous paper (Bazot and Vauclair 2004), seismology can help
choosing between the two scenarios. This star was observed during eight nights
with the spectrograph HARPS at La Silla Observatory. Forty three p-modes have
been identified (Bouchy et al. 2005). In the present paper, we discuss the
modelisation of this star. We computed stellar models iterated to present the
same observable parameters (luminosity, effective temperature, outer chemical
composition) while the internal structure was different according to the two
extreme assumptions : original overmetallicity or accretion. We show that in
any case the seismic constraints lead to models in complete agreement with the
external parameters deduced from spectroscopy and from the Hipparcos parallax
(L and Teff). We discuss the tests which may lead to a choice between the two
typical scenarios. We show that the ``small separation'' seem to give a better
fit for the accretion case than for the overmetallic case, but in spite of the
very good data the uncertainties are still too large to conclude. We discuss
the observations which would be needed to go further and solve this question.",2005-03-31T20:54:23Z
An HLLC Riemann Solver for Relativistic Flows: I. Hydrodynamics,"We present an extension of the HLLC approximate Riemann solver by Toro,
Spruce and Speares to the relativistic equations of fluid dynamics. The solver
retains the simplicity of the original two-wave formulation proposed by Harten,
Lax and van Leer (HLL) but it restores the missing contact wave in the solution
of the Riemann problem. The resulting numerical scheme is computationally
efficient, robust and positively conservative. The performance of the new
solver is evaluated through numerical testing in one and two dimensions.",2005-06-17T14:34:37Z
"GRMHD Simulations of Disk/Jet Systems: Application to the Inner Engines
  of Collapsars","We have carried out 2D and 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of jets launched self-consistently from accretion disks orbiting
Kerr black holes and applied the results to the inner engine of the collapsar
model of gamma-ray bursts. The accretion flow launches energetic jets in the
axial funnel region of the disk/jet system, as well as a substantial coronal
wind. The jets feature knot-like structures of extremely hot,
ultra-relativistic gas; the gas in these knots begins at moderate velocities
near the inner engine, and is accelerated to ultra-relativistic velocities
(Lorentz factors of 50, and higher) by the Lorentz force in the axial funnel.
The increase in jet velocity takes place in an acceleration zone extending to
at least a few hundred gravitational radii from the inner engine. The overall
energetics of the jets are strongly spin-dependent, with high-spin black holes
producing the highest energy and mass fluxes. In addition, with high-spin black
holes, the ultra-relativistic outflow is cylindrically collimated within a few
hundred gravitational radii of the black hole, whereas in the zero- spin case
the jet retains a constant opening angle of approximately 16 degrees. The
simulations also show that the coronal wind, though considerably slower and
colder than the jets, also carries a significant amount of mass and energy.
When simulation data is scaled to the physical dimensions of a collapsar the
jets operate for a period ranging from 0.1 to 1.4 seconds, until the accretion
disk is depleted, delivering $10^{48}$ to $10^{49}$ erg.",2005-02-10T20:06:54Z
Large-scale magnetic field of the G8 dwarf xi Bootis A,"We investigate the magnetic geometry of the active G8 dwarf xi Bootis A, from
spectropolarimetric observations obtained in 2003 with the MuSiCoS echelle
spectropolarimeter at the Telescope Bernard Lyot (Observatoire du Pic du Midi,
France). We repeatedly detect a photospheric magnetic field, with periodic
variations consistent with rotational modulation. Circularly polarized (Stokes
V) line profiles present a systematic asymmetry, showing up as an excess in
amplitude and area of the blue lobe of the profiles. A direct modeling of
Stokes V profiles suggests that the global magnetic field is composed of two
main components, with an inclined dipole and a large-scale toroidal field. We
derive a dipole intensity of about 40 G, with an inclination of 35 degrees of
the dipole with respect to the rotation axis. The toroidal field strength is of
order of 120 G. A noticeable evolution of the field geometry is observed over
the 40 nights of our observing window and results in an increase of the field
strength and of the dipole inclination.
  This study is the first step of a long-term monitoring of xi Bootis A and
other active solar-type stars, with the aim to investigate secular fluctuations
of stellar magnetic geometries induced by activity cycles.",2005-05-20T13:39:58Z
Extranuclear X-ray Emission in the Edge-on Seyfert Galaxy NGC 2992,"We found several extranuclear (r >~ 3"") X-ray nebulae within 40"" (6.3 kpc at
32.5 Mpc) of the nucleus of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 2992. The net X-ray
luminosity from the extranuclear sources is ~2-3 E39 erg/s (0.3-8.0 keV). The
X-ray core itself (r <~ 1"") is positioned at 9:45:41.95 -14:19:34.8 (J2000) and
has a remarkably simple power-law spectrum with photon index Gamma=1.86 and
Nh=7E21 /cm2. The near-nuclear (3"" <~ r <~ 18"") Chandra spectrum is best
modelled by three components: (1) a direct AGN component with Gamma fixed at
1.86, (2) cold Compton reflection of the AGN component, and (3) a 0.5 keV
low-abundance (Z < 0.03 Zsolar) ""thermal plasma,"" with ~10% of the flux of
either of the first two components. The X-ray luminosity of the 3rd component
(the ""soft excess"") is ~1.4E40 erg/s, or ~5X that of all of the detected
extranuclear X-ray sources. We suggest that most (~75-80%) of the soft excess
emission originates from 1"" < r < 3"", which is not imaged in our observation
due to severe CCD pile-up. We also require the cold reflector to be positioned
at least 1"" (158 pc) from the nucleus, since there is no reflection component
in the X-ray core spectrum. Much of the extranuclear X-ray emission is
coincident with radio structures (nuclear radio bubbles and large-scale radio
features), and its soft X-ray luminosity is generally consistent with
luminosities expected from a starburst-driven wind (with the starburst scaled
from L_FIR). However, the AGN in NGC 2992 seems equally likely to power the
galactic wind in that object. Furthermore, AGN photoionization and
photoexcitation processes could dominate the soft excess, especially the
\~75-80% which is not imaged by our observations.",2005-03-31T17:08:23Z
Can hidden correlations mimic a variable fine structure constant?,"Murphy et al. (2003a, MNRAS, 345, 609) claim to find evidence of cosmological
variations of the fine structure constant $\alpha$ in the spectra of
intervening QSO absorption line systems. We find that this result is affected
by systematic effects. The $\alpha$ values estimated in individual line systems
depend on the set of atomic transitions used and therefore the quoted
dependence on the cosmic age may reflect the fact that different sets of
transitions are used at different redshifts. A correlation between line shifts
and relative optical depths of the atomic transitions is also present. This
correlation is very tight for a high-redshift subsample and accounts for the
anomalous dispersion of the $\alpha$ values found by Murphy et al. (2003a) in
this subsample. The above correlations are consistent with a scenario in which
gravitational redshift, caused by the gravity of the dark halo, contributes to
the shift in frequency of individual components. Gravitational redshift causes
differential spectral shifts of the same order as magnitude of those measured.
In the presence of line misidentification, these shifts can be interpreted in
terms of a variable $\alpha$. In order to verify the gravitational redshift
hypothesis, a direct access to Murphy et al. (2003a) data, or to a large amount
of new high resolution data, is necessary.",2005-04-15T09:54:10Z
The baryonic mass function of galaxies,"In the Big Bang about 5% of the mass that was created was in the form of
normal baryonic matter (neutrons and protons). Of this about 10% ended up in
galaxies in the form of stars or of gas (that can be in molecules, can be
atomic, or can be ionised).
  In this work, we measure the baryonic mass function of galaxies, which
describes how the baryonic mass is distributed {\it within} galaxies of
different types (e.g. spiral or elliptical) and of different sizes. This can
provide useful constraints on our current cosmology, convolved with our
understanding of how galaxies form. This work relies on various large
astronomical surveys, for example the optical Sloan Digital Sky Survey (to
observe stars) and the HIPASS radio survey (to observe atomic gas). We then
perform an integral over our mass function to determine the cosmological
density in baryons in galaxies: $\Omega_{\rm b, gal} = 0.0035$. Most of these
baryons are in stars: $\Omega_{*} = 0.0028$. Only about 20% are in gas. The
error on the quantities, as determined from the range obtained between
different methods, is $\sim 10$%; systematic errors may be much larger.
  Most ($\sim 90$%) of the baryons in the Universe are not in galaxies. They
probably exist in a warm/hot intergalactic medium. Searching for direct
observational evidence and deeper theoretical understanding for this will form
one of the major challenges for astronomy in the next decade.",2005-02-24T19:59:11Z
A Search for Very Active Stars in the Galaxy,"We report the first results of a systematic search near the plane of the
Galaxy for the so called very active stars (VAS), which are characterized by a
hard X-ray spectrum and activity in the radio domain. Candidates with hard
X-ray binary-like spectra have been selected from the Bright ROSAT Source
Catalogue in the Zone of Avoidance ($| b | < 20{^o}$) and were tentatively
identified in GB6/PMM/NVSS radio surveys. Most of them were observed with the
ATCA and VLA. Precise radio coordinates have led to unambiguous optical
identification for 60 candidates, and a sub-sample of five of themhas been
observed with the VLT. Also some discovery and confirmatory spectra were
obtained with the AAT (4-m) and BTA (6-m). Spectroscopy with moderate
dispersion, made with the FORS1 spectrograph of the VLT has revealed two
stellar objects (one of them, VASC J1628-41, is definitivelya binary VAS), one
new AGN and two featureless spectrum sources. One of these objects, VASC
J1353-66, shows a marginal evidence of proper motion, which, if confirmed,
would imply the discovery of a new type of galactic source.",2005-02-11T07:50:37Z
Hydrodynamical scaling laws for astrophysical jets,"The idea of a unified model for all astrophysical jets has been considered
for some time now. We present here some hydrodynamical scaling laws relevant
for all type of astrophysical jets, analogous to those of Sams et al. (1996).
We use Buckingham's Pi theorem of dimensional analysis to obtain a family of
dimensional relations among the physical quantities associated with the jets.",2005-03-16T05:48:26Z
"Inferences from pulsational amplitudes and phases for multimode $δ$
  Sct star FG Vir","We combine photometric and spectroscopic data on twelve modes excited in FG
Vir to determine their spherical harmonic degrees, $\ell$, and to obtain
constraints on the star model. The effective temperature consistent with the
mean colours and the pulsation data is about 7200K. In six cases, the $\ell$
identification is unique with above 80 % probability. Two modes are identified
as radial. Simultaneously with $\ell$, we determine a complex parameter $f$
which probes subphotospheric stellar layers. Comparing its values with those
derived from models assuming different treatment of convection, we find
evidence that convective transport in the envelope of this star is inefficient.",2005-04-07T10:32:14Z
Detection of 75+ pulsation frequencies in the Delta Scuti star FG Vir,"Extensive photometric multisite campaigns of the Delta Scuti variable FG Vir
are presented. For the years 2003 and 2004, 926 hours of photometry at the
millimag precision level were obtained. The combinations with earlier campaigns
lead to excellent frequency resolution and high signal/noise. A multifrequency
analysis yields 79 frequencies. This represents a new record for this type of
star. The modes discovered earlier were confirmed. Pulsation occurs over a wide
frequency band from 5.7 to 44.3 c/d with amplitudes of 0.2 mmag or larger.
Within this wide band the frequencies are not distributed at random, but tend
to cluster in groups. A similar feature is seen in the power spectrum of the
residuals after 79 frequencies are prewhitened. This indicates that many
additional modes are excited. The interpretation is supported by a histogram of
the photometric amplitudes, which shows an increase of modes with small
amplitudes. The old question of the 'missing modes' may be answered now: the
large number of detected frequencies as well as the large number of additional
frequencies suggested by the power spectrum of the residuals con rms the
theoretical prediction of a large number of excited modes. FG Vir shows a
number of frequency combinations of the dominant mode at 12.7162 c/d (m = 0)
with other modes of relatively high photometric amplitudes. The amplitudes of
the frequency sums are higher than those of the differences. A second mode
(20.2878 c/d) also shows combinations. This mode of azimuthal order m = -1 is
coupled with two other modes of m = +1.",2005-02-03T17:00:10Z
"The Surprising Anisotropy of Fast Rotating, Disky Elliptical Galaxies","The projected kinematical properties of unequal-mass merger remnants of disk
galaxies are analysed and shown to agree well with observations of disky, fast
rotating elliptical galaxies. This supports the major merger hypothesis of
early-type galaxy formation. However, in contrast to previous claims, the
merger remnants are very anisotropic with values of the anisotropy parameter
that are similar to equal-mass merger remnants that form boxy, slowly rotating
ellipticals. Including gas in the simulations does not change this result
although the line-of-sight velocity profile and the intrinsic orbital structure
are strongly affected by the presenceof gas. The kinematical difference between
boxy and disky ellipticals appears not to be the amount of anisotropy but
rather rotation and the shape of the velocity dispersion tensor. The apparent
isotropy of observed disky ellipticals is shown to result from inclination
effects. Even small inclination angles strongly reduce the measured anisotropy
of fast rotating systems, seen in projection. A second problem is the limited
amount of information that is available when measuring only the central
velocity dispersion and a characteristic rotation and ellipticity. Methods are
investigated that allow a better determination of the intrinsic anisotropy of
fast rotating early-type galaxies with known inclination angles.",2005-04-27T11:09:51Z
"Cluster AgeS Experiment (CASE): Detection of a dwarf nova in the
  globular cluster M55","We report the detection of a dwarf nova (DN) in the core region of the
globular cluster M55. Six outbursts were observed during 8 observing seasons
spanning the period 1997-2004. The variable has an X-ray counterpart detected
on images taken with the ROSAT telescope. Although we cannot offer proof of
cluster membership, one can see that both the position on the H-R diagram and

According to our outburst statistics, no more than one similar DN could remain
undetected in our field of view, centred at the cluster core.",2005-02-22T09:55:09Z
"The Color Selection of Quasars from Redshifts 5 to 10: Cloning and
  Discovery","We present simulations of quasar colors, magnitudes, and numbers at redshifts
5<z<10 based on our discovery of ten new high-redshift quasars and the cloning
of lower redshift Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars. The ten quasars have
redshifts ranging from z=4.7 to z=5.3 and i-magnitudes of 20.21 to 20.94. The
natural diversity of spectral features in the cloned sample allows more
realistic simulation of the quasar locus width than previously possible with
synthetic template spectra. Colors are generated for the z>6 epoch taking
advantage of the new UKIDSS near-infrared filter set, and we examine the
redshift intervals of maximum productivity, discussing color selection and
survey depth issues. On the basis of the SDSS sample, we find that the surface
density of z>4.7 quasars increases by a factor of 3X by extending 0.7
i-magnitudes deeper than the SDSS spectroscopic survey limit of i=20.2 --
correspondingly we predict a total of ~400 faint quasars in the SDSS main area
that have redshift z>4.7 and magnitudes $<20.9.",2005-03-31T21:44:05Z
"The effect of wavefront corrugations on fringe motion in an astronomical
  interferometer with spatial filters","Numerical simulations of atmospheric turbulence and AO wavefront correction
are performed to investigate the timescale for fringe motion in optical
interferometers with spatial filters. These simulations focus especially on
partial AO correction, where only a finite number of Zernike modes are
compensated. The fringe motion is found to depend strongly on both the aperture
diameter and the level of AO correction used. In all of the simulations the
coherence timescale for interference fringes is found to decrease dramatically
when the Strehl ratio provided by the AO correction is <~30%. For AO systems
which give perfect compensation of a limited number of Zernike modes, the
aperture size which gives the optimum signal for fringe phase tracking is
calculated. For AO systems which provide noisy compensation of Zernike modes
(but are perfectly piston-neutral), the noise properties of the AO system
determine the coherence timescale of the fringes when the Strehl ratio is
<~30%.",2005-06-07T09:43:32Z
Is the Galactic submillimeter dust emissivity underestimated?,"We present detailed modeling of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the
spiral galaxies NGC 891, NGC 4013, and NGC 5907 in the far-infrared and submm
wavelengths. The model takes into account the emission produced by the diffuse
dust and the star forming HII complexes. The dust mass is constrained by
radiative transfer simulations in the optical (Xilouris et al. 1999). We find
that the submm emission predicted by our model cannot account for the observed
fluxes. Two scenarios may account for the ""missing"" submm flux. In the first
scenario (Popescu et al. 2000), additional dust (to that derived from the
optical, and associated with young stars) is embedded in the galaxy in the form
of a thin disk and gives rise to additional submm emission. The other scenario
investigates whether the average submm emissivity of the dust grains is higher
than the values widely used in Galactic environments. In this case, the dust
mass is equal to that derived from the optical observations, and the submm
emissivity is treated as a free parameter calculated by fitting our model to
the observed SED. We find the submm emissivity value to be ~3 times that often
used for our Galaxy. While both scenarios reproduce the observed 850 micron
surface brightness, the extra embedded dust model is not supported by the near
infrared observations. We, thus, find that the enhanced dust submm emissivity
scenario is the most plausible. [abridged]",2005-03-31T15:01:15Z
"X-Ray Flares of Sun-Like Young Stellar Objects and Their Effects on
  Protoplanetary Disks","Astronomical observations of flares from analogs of the early Sun have the
potential to give critical insights into the high energy irradiation
environment of protoplanetary disks. Solar-mass young stellar objects are
significantly more X-ray luminous than the typical low-mass T Tauri star. They
undergo frequent strong flaring on a several day time scale. Very powerful
flares also occur, but on a longer time frame. The hard X-ray spectrum of these
stars become even harder during flaring. The X-rays from these sun-like young
stellar objects have the potential to ionize circumstellar material out to
large distances. Three specific illustrations are given of the effects of the
X-rays: The physics and chemistry of the atmospheres of the inner accretion
disks; the ionization level at the disk midplane, important for the viability
of the magnetorotational instability; and the nuclear fluence in the
irradiation zone just interior to the inner edge of the disk, important in
local irradiation scenarios for producing the short-lived radionuclides found
in meteorites.",2005-05-27T17:12:52Z
Exploring Terrestrial Planet Formation in the TW Hydrae Association,"Spitzer Space Telescope infrared measurements are presented for 24 members of
the TW Hydrae association (TWA). High signal-to-noise 24-micron (um) photometry
is presented for all of these stars, including 20 stars that were not detected
by IRAS. Among these 20 stars, only a single object, TWA 7, shows excess
emission at 24um and at the level of only 40% above the star's photosphere. TWA
7 also exhibits a strong 70um excess that is a factor of 40 brighter than the
stellar photosphere at this wavelength. At 70um, an excess of similar magnitude
is detected for TWA 13, though no 24um excess was detected for this binary. For
the 18 stars that failed to show measurable IR excesses, the sensitivity of the
current 70um observations does not rule out substantial cool excesses at levels
10-40x above their stellar continua. Measurements of two T Tauri stars, TW Hya
and Hen 6-300, confirm that their spectacular IR spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) do not turn over even by 160um, consistent with the expectation for
their active accretion disks. In contrast, the Spitzer data for the luminous
planetary debris systems in the TWA, HD 98800B and HR 4796A, are consistent
with single-temperature blackbody SEDs. The major new result of this study is
the dramatic bimodal distribution found for the association in the form of
excess emission at a wavelength of 24um, indicating negligible amounts of warm
(>100 K) dust and debris around 20 of 24 stars in this group of very young
stars. This bimodal distribution is especially striking given that the four
stars in the association with strong IR excesses are >100x brighter at 24um
than their photospheres.",2005-06-13T20:49:32Z
Anti-solar differential rotation,"The differential rotation of anti-solar type detected by observations for
several stars may result from a fast meridional flow. The sufficiently
intensive meridional circulation may be caused by large-scale thermal
inhomogeneities or, perhaps, by tidal forcing from a companion star. First
results of simulations of the anti-solar rotation of a giant star with
magnetically induced thermal inhomogeneities are presented. Perspectives for
observational check of the theory are discussed.",2005-04-07T08:48:17Z
"Simultaneous Flavor Transformation of Neutrinos and Antineutrinos with
  Dominant Potentials from Neutrino-Neutrino Forward Scattering","In astrophysical environments with intense neutrino fluxes, neutrino-neutrino
forward scattering contributes both diagonal and off-diagonal potentials to the
flavor-basis Hamiltonian that governs neutrino flavor evolution. We examine a
special case where adiabatic flavor evolution can produce an off-diagonal
potential from neutrino-neutrino forward scattering that dominates over both
the corresponding diagonal term and the potential from neutrino-matter forward
scattering. In this case, we find a solution that, unlike the ordinary
Mikeyhev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein scenario, has both neutrinos and antineutrinos
maximally mixed in medium over appreciable ranges of neutrino and antineutrino
energy. Employing the measured solar and atmospheric neutrino mass-squared
differences, we identify the conditions on neutrino fluxes that are required
for this solution to exist deep in the supernova environment, where it could
affect the neutrino signal, heavy-element nucleosynthesis, and even the revival
of the supernova shock. We speculate on how this solution might or might not be
attained in realistic supernova evolution. Though this solution is ephemeral in
time and/or space in supernovae, it may signal the onset of subsequent
appreciable flavor mixing for both neutrinos and antineutrinos. A similar
solution may also exist in an early universe with significant net
neutrino-lepton numbers.",2005-05-12T02:36:56Z
Galaxy Morphology - Halo Gas Connections,"We studied a sample of 38 intermediate redshift MgII absorption-selected
galaxies using (1) Keck/HIRES and VLT/UVES quasar spectra to measure the halo
gas kinematics from MgII absorption profiles and (2) HST/WFPC-2 images to study
the absorbing galaxy morphologies. We have searched for correlations between
quantified gas absorption properties, and host galaxy impact parameters,
inclinations, position angles, and quantified morphological parameters. We
report a 3.2-sigma correlation between asymmetric perturbations in the host
galaxy morphology and the MgII absorption equivalent width. We suggest that
this correlation may indicate a connection between past merging and/or
interaction events in MgII absorption-selected galaxies and the velocity
dispersion and quantity of gas surrounding these galaxies.",2005-05-10T22:05:05Z
"Red giant branch stars as probes of stellar populations. II. Properties
  of the newly discovered globular cluster GLIMPSE-C01","Deep near infrared photometry of the newly discovered Galactic globular
Cluster GLIMPSE-C01 is reported. We derived for the first time the metal
abundance of this object from the slope of the RGB: [Fe/H]=-1.61+/-0.14 in the
scale of Zinn (as implemented in Harris 1996), [Fe/H]=-1.44+/-0.12 in the scale
of Caretta & Gratton (1997), and [Fe/H]=-1.12+/-0.12 in the scale of Ferraro et
al. (1999). The tip and the clump of the red giant branch were used to confirm
the estimates of Kobulnicky et al. (2005), placing the cluster at D~3.7+/-0.8
kpc, behind A_v~15 mag of visual extinction. The best fit to the radial surface
brightness profile with a single-mass King's model (1962) yielded core radius
r_c=0.78 arcmin, tidal radius r_t=27 arcmin, and central concentration c=1.54.
  Finally, we estimate the number of the ""missing"" globulars in the central
region of the Milky Way. Based on the spatial distribution of the known
clusters, and assuming radial symmetry around the Galactic center, we conclude
that the Milky Way contains at least 10+/-3 undiscovered objects. The
distribution of known clusters in the bulge seem to resemble the orientation of
the Milky Way bar.",2005-06-01T19:02:44Z
"A Photometric Study of the Light Variations of the Triple System DG
  Leonis","Multi-site and multi-year differential photometry of the triple star DG Leo
reveals a complex frequency spectrum that can be modelled as the combination of
at least three Delta Scuti type frequencies in the range 11.5-13 c/d (with
semi-amplitudes of 2-7 mmag) and a superimposed slow variability of larger
amplitude. The period of the slow variation fits very well with half the
orbital period of the inner spectroscopic binary indicating the presence of
ellipsoidal variations caused by the tidally deformed components in a close
configuration. These findings, together with the results of a recent
spectroscopic analysis (showing that the system consists of a pair of mild Am
stars and one A-type component of normal solar composition), infer that DG Leo
is an extremely interesting asteroseismic target. Identification of which
component(s) of this multiple system is (or are) pulsating and determination of
the excited pulsation modes will both contribute to a much better understanding
of the non-trivial link between multiplicity, chemical composition, rotation,
and pulsation in the lower part of the classical Cepheid instability strip.",2005-05-02T13:30:25Z
"On the evolution of rapidly rotating massive white dwarfs towards
  supernovae or collapses","A recent study by Yoon & Langer (2004a) indicated that the inner cores of
rapidly accreting (Mdot > 10^{-7} M_sun/yr) CO white dwarfs may rotate
differentially, with a shear rate near the threshold value for the onset of the
dynamical shear instability. Such differentially rotating white dwarfs obtain
critical masses for thermonuclear explosion or electron-capture induced
collapse which significantly exceed the canonical Chandrasekhar limit. Here, we
construct two-dimensional differentially rotating white dwarf models with
rotation laws resembling those of the one-dimensional models of Yoon & Langer
(2004a). We derive analytic relations between the white dwarf mass, its angular
momentum, and its rotational-, gravitational- and binding energy. We show that
these relations are applicable for a wide range of angular velocity profiles,
including solid body rotation. We demonstrate that pre-explosion and
pre-collapse conditions of both, rigidly and differentially rotating white
dwarfs are well established by the present work, which may facilitate future
multi-dimensional simulations of Type Ia supernova explosions and studies of
the formation of millisecond pulsars and gamma-ray bursts from collapsing white
dwarfs.Our results lead us to suggest various possible evolutionary scenarios
for progenitors of Type Ia supernovae, leading to a new paradigm of a variable
mass of exploding white dwarfs, at values well above the classical
Chandrasekhar mass. Based on our 2D-models, we argue for the supernova peak
brightness being proportional to the white dwarf mass, which could explain
various aspects of the diversity of Type Ia supernovae, such as their variation
in brightness, the dependence of their mean luminosity on the host galaxy type,
and the weak correlation between ejecta velocity and peak brightness.",2005-02-07T10:41:00Z
The Outward Radial Offset of Neptune Ring Arcs,"The designation of the customary restricted three-body disturbing potential
$\Phi$ as the perturbation Hamiltonian is believed to be the cause of Neptune
ring arcs' radial offset between theories and observations. To identify the
appropriate perturbation Hamiltonian, the energy integral in the fixed frame of
a restricted three-body system, consisting of the central, primary, and test
bodies, is reconsidered. It is shown that the perturbation energy includes the
disturbing potential $\Phi$ and the potential arising from the angular momentum
terms of the test body. Both potentials happen to be singular as the test body
goes to infinity contradicting to the perturbation nature. These two potentials
can be combined to an energy relevant disturbing potential $\Phi^{*}=\beta\Phi$
which is regular at infinity because of the cancellation of the singularities.
For circular orbits of the primary, the energy equation is conservative, and
$\Phi^{*}$ is identified as the perturbation Hamiltonian. Applying this result
to evaluate the backgrund effect of Triton to the arc-Galatea system of
Neptune, it is shown that there is a small difference
$\Delta\Phi=(\Phi^{*}-\Phi)$ which amounts to an outward radial offset of the
corotation location of Galatea by 0.3 Km. The mismatch between the pattern
speed of Galatea's corotation potential and the mean motion velocity of the
arcs could be resolved by considering the finite mass of Fraternite. However,
by using $\Phi^{*}$, Galatea's eccentricity could be reassessed in terms of the
mass of Fraternite.",2005-03-01T19:41:00Z
"An Assessment of the Fe XVIII and Fe XIX Line Ratios from the Chandra
  Grating Observations of Capella","Observations of Fe XVIII and Fe XIX X-ray, EUV, and FUV line emission, formed
at the peak of Capella's (alpha Aurigae) emission measure distribution and
ubiquitous in spectra of many cool stars and galaxies, provide a unique
opportunity to test the robustness of Fe XVIII and Fe XIX spectral models. The
Astrophysical Plasma Emission Code (APEC) is used to identify over 35 lines
from these two ions alone, and to compare model predictions with spectra
obtained with the Chandra Low Energy Transmission Grating and High Energy
Transmission Grating Spectrometers, the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer,
and the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer. Some flux discrepancies larger than
factors of two are found between observations of Fe XVIII and Fe XIX lines and
predictions by APEC and other models in common usage. In particular the X-ray
resonance lines for both ions are stronger than predicted by all models
relative to the EUV resonance lines. The multiwavelength observations
demonstrate the importance of including dielectronic recombination and proton
impact excitation, and of using accurate wavelengths in spectral codes. These
ions provide important diagnostic tools for 10^7 K plasmas currently observed
with Chandra, XMM-Newton, and FUSE.",2005-03-08T15:09:07Z
"Discovery of multi-seeded multi-mode formation of embedded clusters in
  the Rosette Molecular Complex","An investigation based on data from the spatially complete 2MASS Survey
reveals that a remarkable burst of clustered star formation is taking place
throughout the south-east quadrant of the Rosette Molecular Cloud. Compact
clusters are forming in a multi-seeded mode, in parallel and at various places.
In addition, sparse aggregates of embedded young stars are extensively
distributed. In this study, we report the primary results and implications for
high-mass and clustered star formation in giant molecular clouds. In
particular, we incorporate for the first time the birth of medium to low-mass
stars into the scenario of sequential formation of OB clusters. Following the
emergence of the young OB cluster NGC 2244, a variety of manifestations of
forming clusters of medium to high mass appear in the vicinity of the swept-up
layer of the H{\small II} region as well as further into the molecular cloud.
The embedded clusters appear to form in a structured manner, which suggests
they follow tracks laid out by the decay of macroturbulence. We address the
possible origins of the turbulence. This leads us to propose a tree model to
interpret the neat spatial distribution of clusters within a large section of
the Rosette complex. Prominent new generation OB clusters are identified at the
root of the tree pattern.",2005-04-01T03:33:25Z
Magnetically limited X-ray filaments in young SNR,"We discuss the damping of strong magnetic turbulence downstream of the
forward shock of young supernova remnants (SNR). We find that strong magnetic
fields, that have been produced by the streaming instability in the upstream
region of the shock, or by other kinetic instabilities at the shock, will be
efficiently reduced, so the region of enhanced magnetic field strength would
typically have a thickness of the order l_d=(10^{16}-10^{17}) cm. The
non-thermal X-ray filaments observed in young SNR are thus likely limited by
the magnetic field and not by the energy losses of the radiating electrons.
Consequently the thickness of the filaments would not be a measure of the
magnetic field strength and claims of efficient cosmic-ray acceleration on
account of a run-away streaming instability appear premature.",2005-02-22T23:21:54Z
"Early GRB afterglow from a reverse shock as a tracer of the prompt
  gamma-ray light curve","We discuss the optical and radio early afterglow emission of the reverse
shock that crosses a baryonic ejecta as it interacts with the external
interstellar medium (ISM). We show that the peak of the optical flash divides
the light curve of the reverse shock into two distinctive phases. The emission
after the peak depends weakly on the initial conditions of the ejecta and
therefore it can be used as an identifiable signature of a reverse shock
emission. On the other hand, the emission before the optical peak is highly
sensitive to the initial conditions and therefore can be used to investigate
the initial hydrodynamic profile of the ejecta. In particular, if the prompt
$\gamma$-ray emission results from internal shocks, the early reverse shock
emission should resemble a smoothed version of the prompt $\gamma$-ray light
curve.",2005-02-23T04:24:26Z
Nebular abundances of southern symbiotic stars,"We have calculated relative elemental abundances for a sample of 43 symbiotic
stars. Helium abundances and the relative elemental abundances N/O, Ne/O, Ar/O
were derived from new spectra collected in the optical range through low
dispersion spectroscopy. The He ionic abundances were derived taking into
account self-absorption effects in Balmer lines. We found that the symbiotic
stars in the galactic bulge have heavy element abundances showing the same wide
distribution as other bulge objects. In the galactic disk, the symbiotic stars
follow the abundance gradient as derived from different kinds of objects.",2005-02-16T05:11:14Z
ISO observations and models of galaxies with Hidden Broad Line Regions,"We present ISO mid-infrared spectrophotometry and far-infrared photometry of
galaxies with Hidden Broad Line Regions (HBLR). We also present radiative
transfer models of their spectral energy distributions which enable us to
separate the contributions from the dusty disc of the AGN and the dusty
starbursts. We find that the combination of tapered discs (discs whose
thickness increases with distance from the central source in the inner part but
stays constant in the outer part) and starbursts provide good fits to the data.
The tapered discs dominate in the mid-infrared part of the spectrum and the
starbursts in the far-infrared. After correcting the AGN luminosity for
anisotropic emission we find that the ratio of the AGN luminosity to the
starburst luminosity, L(AGN)/L(SB), ranges from about unity for IRAS14454-4343
to about 13 for IRAS01475-0740. Our results suggest that the warm IRAS colours
of HBLR are due to the relatively high L(AGN)/L(SB). Our fits are consistent
with the unified model and the idea that the infrared emission of AGN is
dominated by a dusty disc in the mid-infrared and starbursts in the
far-infrared.",2005-04-20T07:56:11Z
"Multicolour photometry of Balloon 090100001: linking the two classes of
  pulsating hot subdwarfs","We present results of the multicolour UBVR photometry of the high-amplitude
EC14026-type star, Balloon 090100001. The data span over a month and consist of
more than a hundred hours of observations. Fourier analysis of these data led
us to the detection of at least 30 modes of pulsation of which 22 are
independent. The frequencies of 13 detected modes group in three narrow ranges,
around 2.8, 3.8 and 4.7 mHz, where the radial fundamental mode, the first and
second overtones are likely to occur. Surprisingly, we also detect 9
independent modes in the low-frequency domain, between 0.15 and 0.4 mHz. These
modes are typical for pulsations found in PG1716+426-type stars, discovered
recently among cool B-type subdwarfs. The modes found in these stars are
attributed to the high-order g modes. As both kinds of pulsations are observed
in Balloon 090100001, it represents a link between the two classes of pulsating
hot subdwarfs. At present, it is probably the most suitable target for testing
evolutionary scenarios and internal constitution models of these stars by means
of asteroseismology.
  Three of the modes we discovered form an equidistant frequency triplet which
can be explained by invoking rotational splitting of an $\ell$ = 1 mode. The
splitting amounts to about 1.58 $\mu$Hz, leading to a rotation period of 7.1
$\pm$ 0.1 days.",2005-04-03T22:09:38Z
"Three Li-rich K giants: IRAS 12327-6523, IRAS 13539-4153, and IRAS
  17596-3952","We report on spectroscopic analyses of three K giants previously suggested to
be Li-rich: IRAS 12327-6523, IRAS 13539-4153, and IRAS 17596-3952.
High-resolution optical spectra and the LTE model atmospheres are used to
derive the stellar parameters: ($T_{\rm eff}$, log $g$, [Fe/H]), elemental
abundances, and the isotopic ratio $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C. IRAS 13539-4153 shows an
extremely high Li abundance of $\log\epsilon$(Li) $\approx$ 4.2, a value ten
times more than the present Li abundance in the local interstellar medium. This
is the third highest Li abundance yet reported for a K giant. IRAS 12327-6523
shows a Li abundances of $\log\epsilon$(Li)$\approx$ 1.4. IRAS 17596-3952 is a
rapidly rotating ($V{\sin i}$ $\approx$ 35 km s$^{-1}$) K giant with

"The X-ray Spectral Properties and Variability of Luminous High-Redshift
  Active Galactic Nuclei","We perform a detailed investigation of moderate-to-high quality X-ray spectra
of ten of the most luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs) known at z>4 (up to
z~6.28). This study includes five new XMM observations and five archived X-ray
observations (four by XMM and one by Chandra). We find that the X-ray power-law
photon indices of our sample, composed of eight radio-quiet sources and two
that are moderately radio loud, are not significantly different from those of
lower redshift AGNs. The upper limits obtained on intrinsic neutral hydrogen
column densities, N_H<~10^{22}-10^{23} cm^{-2}, indicate that these AGNs are
not significantly absorbed. A joint fit performed on our eight radio-quiet
sources, with a total of ~7000 photons, constrains the mean photon index of z>4
radio-quiet AGNs to Gamma=1.97^{+0.06}_{-0.04}, with no detectable intrinsic
dispersion from source to source. We also obtain a strong constraint on the
mean intrinsic column density, N_H<~3x10^{21} cm^{-2}, showing that optically
selected radio-quiet AGNs at z>4 are, on average, not more absorbed than their
lower-redshift counterparts. All this suggests that the X-ray production
mechanism and the central environment in radio-quiet AGNs have not
significantly evolved over cosmic time. The mean equivalent width of a putative
neutral narrow Fe Ka line is constrained to be <~190 eV, and similarly we place
constraints on the mean Compton reflection component (R<~1.2). None of the AGNs
varied on short (~1 hr) timescales, but on longer timescales (months-to-years)
strong variability is observed in four of the sources. In particular, the X-ray
flux of the z=5.41 radio-quiet AGN SDSS 0231-0728 dropped by a factor of ~4
over a rest-frame period of 73 d. This is the most extreme X-ray variation
observed in a luminous z>4 radio-quiet AGN.",2005-05-23T20:22:26Z
"Large-Scale Sidereal Anisotropy of Galactic Cosmic-Ray Intensity
  Observed by the Tibet Air Shower Array","We present the large-scale sidereal anisotropy ofgalactic cosmic-ray
intensity in the multi-TeV region observed with the Tibet-IIIair shower array
during the period from 1999 through 2003. The sidereal daily variation of
cosmic rays observed in this experiment shows an excess of relative intensity
around $4\sim7 $ hours local sidereal time, as well as a deficit around 12
hours local sidereal time. While the amplitude of the excess is not significant
when averaged over all declinations, the excess in individual declinaton bands
becomes larger and clearer as the viewing direction moves toward the south. The
maximum phase of the excess intensity changes from $\sim$7 at the northern
hemisphere to $\sim$4 hours at the equatorial region. We also show that both
the amplitude and the phase of the first harmonic vector of the daily variation
are remarkably independent of primary energy in the multi-TeV region. This is
the first result determining the energy and declination dependences of the full
24-hour profiles of the sidereal daily variation in the multi-TeV region with a
single air shower experiment.",2005-05-06T05:42:57Z
"Cosmological Constraints on the Very Low Frequency Gravitational-Wave
  Background","While there are no strong observational constraints on the gravitational wave
background across six or more orders of magnitude between 10^{-16} Hz and
10^{-10} Hz and it is difficult to get a constraint below 10^{-12}Hz using
objects in our Galaxy, we suggest that the anisotropy pattern of time variation
of the redshift related to a sample of high redshift objects can be used to
constrain the gravitational wave background around 10^{-12} Hz. Useful
observations for the monitoring of an anisotropy signal in a global redshift
change include spectroscopic observations of the Ly-alpha forest in absorption
towards a sample of quasars, redshifted 21 cm line observations either in
absorption or emission towards a sample of neutral HI regions before or during
reionization, and high frequency (0.1 Hz to 1
  Hz) gravitational wave analysis of a sample of neutron star--neutron star
binaries detected with gravitational wave instruments such as the Decihertz
Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (DECIGO). The low frequency
background can also be constrained by arcsecond-scale anisotropy observations
of the CMB. For reasonable observations in the future involving extragalactic
sources, we find best limits at the level of \Omega_{GW} < 10^{-5} at a
frequency around 10^{-12} Hz while the eventual ultimate limit one cannot beat
is \Omega_{GW} < 10^{-11}.",2005-02-02T23:53:34Z
On the massive stellar population of the Super Star Cluster Westerlund 1,"We present new spectroscopic and photometric observations of the young
Galactic open cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd 1) that reveal a unique population of
massive evolved stars. We identify ~200 cluster members and present
spectroscopic classifications for ~25% of these. We find that all stars so
classified are unambiguously post-Main Sequence objects, consistent with an
apparent lack of an identifiable Main Sequence in our photometric data to V~20.
We are able to identify rich populations of Wolf Rayet stars, OB supergiants
and short lived transitional objects. Of these, the latter group consists of
both hot (Luminous Blue Variable and extreme B supergiants) and cool (Yellow
Hypergiant and Red Supergiant) objects - we find that half the known Galactic
population of YHGs resides within Wd1. We obtain a mean V-M_V ~25 mag from the
cluster Yellow Hypergiants, implying a Main Sequence turnoff at or below M_V
=-5 (O7 V or later). Based solely on the masses inferred for the 53
spectroscopically classified stars, we determine an absolute minimum mass of
\~1.5 x 10^3 Msun for Wd 1. However, considering the complete photometrically
and spectroscopically selected cluster population and adopting a Kroupa IMF we
infer a likely mass for Wd 1 of ~10^5 Msun, noting that inevitable source
confusion and incompleteness are likely to render this an underestimate. As
such, Wd 1 is the most massive compact young cluster yet identified in the
Local Group, with a mass exceeding that of Galactic Centre clusters such as the
Arches and Quintuplet. Indeed, the luminosity, inferred mass and compact nature
of Wd 1 are comparable with those of Super Star Clusters - previously
identified only in external galaxies - and is consistent with expectations for
a Globular Cluster progenitor.",2005-04-15T11:22:38Z
"The first observed stellar X-ray flare oscillation: Constraints on the
  flare loop length and the magnetic field","We present the first X-ray observation of an oscillation during a stellar
flare. The flare occurred on the active M-type dwarf AT Mic and was observed
with XMM-Newton. The soft X-ray light curve (0.2-12 keV) is investigated with
wavelet analysis. The flare's extended, flat peak shows clear evidence for a
damped oscillation with a period of around 750 s, an exponential damping time
of around 2000 s, and an initial, relative peak-to-peak amplitude of around
15%. We suggest that the oscillation is a standing magneto-acoustic wave tied
to the flare loop, and find that the most likely interpretation is a
longitudinal, slow-mode wave, with a resulting loop length of (2.5 +- 0.2) e10
cm. The local magnetic field strength is found to be (105 +- 50) G. These
values are consistent with (oscillation-independent) flare cooling time models
and pressure balance scaling laws. Such a flare oscillation provides an
excellent opportunity to obtain coronal properties like the size of a flare
loop or the local magnetic field strength for the otherwise
spatially-unresolved star.",2005-03-17T12:33:42Z
"The Physical Properties and Effective Temperature Scale of O-type Stars
  as a Function of Metallicity. II. Analysis of 20 More Magellanic Cloud Stars,
  and Results from the Complete Sample","We analyze the optical and UV spectra of an additional sample of 20
Magellanic Cloud O stars, and draw conclusions from the complete sample of 40
stars. We find (1) The SMC O3-7 dwarfs are about 4000 K cooler than their
Galactic counterparts; this is in the sense expected from the decreased
signficiance of line-blanketing and wind-blanketing at lower metallicities. The
difference decreases with later types, becoming negligible by B0 V. A similar
difference is found for the supergiants. (2) The wind momentum of these stars
scales with luminosity and metallicty in the ways predicted by
radiatively-driven wind theory. (3) A comparison of the masses derived from
spectroscopy with those derived from stellar evolutionary theory shows a
significant discrepancy for stars hotter than 45000, although good agreement is
found for cooler stars. (4) For the hottest O stars (O2-3.5) neither the
NIII/NIV ratio, nor even the HeI/HeII ratio, does a good job of predicting the
effective temperature by itself. Instead, a full analysis is needed to derive
physical parameters. Thus there are O3.5V stars which are as hot or hotter than
stars classified as O2V. (5) The two stars with the most discordant radial
velocities in our sample happen to be O3 ""field stars"". This provides the first
compelling observational evidence that the ""field"" O stars in the Magellanic
Clouds may be runaway OB stars, ejected from their birth place.",2005-03-22T03:26:05Z
Models for the soft X-ray emission of post-outburst classical novae,"A hydrostatic and stationary white dwarf envelope model has been developed
for the study of the post-outburst phases of classical novae and their soft
X-ray emission. Several white dwarf masses and chemical compositions typical
for classical novae have been considered. The results show that the luminosity,
maximum effective temperature and envelope masses depend on the white dwarf
mass and on the chemical composition. Envelope masses for which equilibrium
solutions exist are pretty small ~10^{-7}-10^{-6} Msun, thus leading to a short
duration of the soft X-ray emitting phase of classical novae, in agreement with
most of the observations. The models presented provide a useful tool for the
determination of the white dwarf properties from observable parameters in the
X-ray range.",2005-04-15T15:44:43Z
GEMS: The Size Evolution of Disk Galaxies,"We combine HST imaging from the GEMS survey with photometric redshifts from
COMBO-17 to explore the evolution of disk-dominated galaxies since z<1.1. The
sample is comprised of all GEMS galaxies with Sersic indices n<2.5, derived
from fits to the galaxy images. We account fully for selection effects through
careful analysis of image simulations; we are limited by the depth of the
redshift and HST data to the study of galaxies with absolute magnitudes
M(V)<-20, or equivalently stellar masses log(M)>10. We find strong evolution in
the magnitude-size scaling relation for galaxies with M(V)<-20, corresponding
to a brightening of 1 mag per sqarcsec in rest-frame V-band by z=1. Yet, disks
at a given absolute magnitude are bluer and have lower stellar mass-to-light
ratios at z=1 than at the present day. As a result, our findings indicate weak
or no evolution in the relation between stellar mass and effective disk size
for galaxies with log(M)>10 over the same time interval. This is strongly
inconsistent with the most naive theoretical expectation, in which disk size
scales in proportion to the halo virial radius, which would predict that disks
are a factor of two denser at fixed mass at z=1. The lack of evolution in the
stellar mass-size relation is consistent with an ``inside-out'' growth of
galaxy disks on average (galaxies increasing in size as they grow more
massive), although we cannot rule out more complex evolutionary scenarios.",2005-02-21T15:48:07Z
Molecular Hydrogen Emission from Protoplanetary Disks,"We have modeled self-consistently the density and temperature profiles of gas
and dust in protoplanetary disks, taking into account irradiation from a
central star. Making use of this physical structure, we have calculated the
level populations of molecular hydrogen and the line emission from the disks.
As a result, we can reproduce the observed strong line spectra of molecular
hydrogen from protoplanetary disks, both in the ultraviolet (UV) and the
near-infrared, but only if the central star has a strong UV excess radiation.",2005-05-06T13:06:36Z
The generation of low-energy cosmic rays in molecular clouds,"It is argued that if cosmic rays penetrate into molecular clouds, the total
energy they lose can exceed the energy from galactic supernovae shocks. It is
shown that most likely galactic cosmic rays interacting with the surface layers
of molecular clouds are efficiently reflected and do not penetrate into the
cloud interior. Low-energy cosmic rays ($E<1$ GeV) that provide the primary
ionization of the molecular cloud gas can be generated inside such clouds by
multiple shocks arising due to supersonic turbulence.",2005-03-24T10:58:32Z
Evolution of Field Dwarf Galaxies with GEMS,"We present a study of the evolution of late-type field dwarfs over the last ~
1.9 Gyr, based on HST ACS observations carried out as part of the GEMS survey.
This study is amongst the first to probe the evolution of dwarfs over such a
large timescale. The comparison of structural properties, particularly size and
scale length, indicates that the dwarfs in the redshift range z ~ 0.01 to 0.15
(look-back times up to 1.9 Gyr) are more extended than local dwarfs. We argue
that this difference is due to the star formation activity becoming more
centrally concentrated in late-type dwarfs over the last ~ 1.9 Gyr. We discuss
several possible causes for this evolution. We also find a lack of blue compact
dwarfs in the GEMS sample and interpret this as indicative of the fact that
strong, centrally concentrated star formation is a feature of evolved dwarfs
that are entering their final stages of evolution.",2005-05-25T16:23:24Z
Secular Evolution in Mira Variable Pulsations,"Stellar evolution theory predicts that asymptotic giant branch stars undergo
a series of short thermal pulses that significantly change their luminosity and
mass on timescales of hundreds to thousands of years. Secular changes in these
stars resulting from thermal pulses can be detected as measurable changes in
period if the star is undergoing Mira pulsations. The American Association of
Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) International Database currently contains
visual data for over 1500 Mira variables. Light curves for these stars span
nearly a century in some cases, making it possible to study the secular
evolution of the pulsation behavior on these timescales. In this paper, we
present the results of our study of period change in 547 Mira variables using
data from the AAVSO. We find non-zero rates of period change, dlnP/dt, at the
2-sigma significance level in 57 of the 547 stars, at the 3-sigma level in 21
stars, and at the level of 6-sigma or greater in eight of the 547. The latter
eight stars have been previously noted in the literature, and our derived rates
of period changes largely agree with published values. The largest and most
statistically significant dlnP/dt are consistent with the rates of period
change expected during thermal pulses on the AGB. A number of other stars
exhibit non-monotonic period changes on decades-long timescales, the cause of
which is not yet known.",2005-04-24T13:11:52Z
"How JWST can measure First Light, Reionization and Galaxy Assembly","We summarize the design and performance of the James Webb Space Telescope

Constraints on z~10 Galaxies from the Deepest HST NICMOS Fields,"We use all available fields with deep NICMOS imaging to search for J dropouts
(H<28) at z~10. Our primary data set for this search were the two J+H NICMOS
parallel fields taken with the ACS HUDF. The 5 sigma limiting mags were 28.6 in
J and 28.5 in H. Several shallower fields were also used: J+H NICMOS frames
available over the HDF North, the HDF South NICMOS parallel, and the ACS HUDF.
The primary selection criterion was (J-H)>1.8. 11 such sources were found in
all search fields using this criterion. 8 of these were clearly ruled out as
credible z~10 sources, either as a result of detections (>2 sigma) blueward of
J or their colors redward of the break (H-K~1.5). The nature of the 3 remaining
sources could not be determined from the data. The number appears consistent
with the expected contamination from low-z interlopers. Analysis of the stacked
images for the 3 candidates also suggests contamination. Regardless of their
true redshifts, the actual number of z~10 sources must be <=3. To assess the
significance of these results, two lower redshift samples (a z~3.8 B-dropout
and z~6 i-dropout sample) were projected to z~8-12 using a (1+z)^{-1} size
scaling. They were added to the image frames, and the selection repeated,
giving 15.6 and 4.8 J-dropouts, respectively. This suggests that to the limit
of this probe (0.3 L*) there has been evolution from z~3.8 and possibly from
z~6. This is consistent with the strong evolution already noted at z~6 and
z~7.5 relative to z~3-4. Even assuming that 3 sources from this probe are at
z~10, the rest-frame continuum UV (~1500 A) luminosity density at z~10
(integrated down to 0.3 L*) is just 0.19_{-0.09}^{+0.13}x that at z~3.8 (or
0.19_{-0.10}^{+0.15}x including cosmic variance). However, if none of our
sources is at z~10, this ratio has a 1 sigma upper limit of 0.07. (abridged)",2005-03-05T10:13:03Z
The XENON Dark Matter Experiment,"The XENON experiment aims at the direct detection of dark matter in the form
of WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) via their elastic scattering
off Xenon nuclei. With a fiducial mass of 1000 kg of liquid xenon, a
sufficiently low threshold of ~16 keV recoil energy and an un-rejected
background rate of 10 events per year, XENON would be sensitive to a
WIMP-nucleon interaction cross section of 10^(-46) cm^2, for WIMPs with masses
above 50 GeV. The 1 tonne scale experiment (XENON1T) will be realized with an
array of ten identical 100 kg detector modules (XENON100). The detectors are
time projection chambers operated in dual (liquid/gas) phase, to detect
simultaneously the ionization, through secondary scintillation in the gas, and
primary scintillation in the liquid produced by low energy recoils. The
distinct ratio of primary to secondary scintillation for nuclear recoils from
WIMPs (or neutrons), and for electron recoils from background, is key to the
event-by-event discrimination capability of XENON. A 3kg dual phase detector
with light readout provided by an array of 7 photomultipliers is currently
being tested, along with other prototypes dedicated to various measurements
relevant to the XENON program. We present some of the results obtained to-date
and briefly discuss the next step in the phased approach to the XENON
experiment, i.e. the development and underground deployment of a 10 kg detector
(XENON10) within 2005.",2005-02-15T00:47:35Z
The Formation of Fossil Galaxy Groups in the hierarchical Universe,"We use a set of twelve high-resolution N-body/hydrodynamical simulations in
the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology to investigate the origin and formation rate of
fossil groups (FGs), which are X-ray bright galaxy groups dominated by a large
elliptical galaxy, with the second brightest galaxy being at least two
magnitudes fainter. The simulations invoke star formation, chemical evolution
with non-instantaneous recycling, metal dependent radiative cooling, strong
star burst driven galactic super winds, effects of a meta-galactic UV field and
full stellar population synthesis. We find an interesting correlation between
the magnitude gap between the first and second brightest galaxy and the
formation time of the group. It is found that FGs have assembled half of their
final dark matter mass already at $z\ga1$, and subsequently typically grow by
minor merging only, wheras non-FGs on average form later. The early assembly of
FGs leaves sufficient time for galaxies of $L \sim L_*$ to merge into the
central one by dynamical friction, resulting in the large magnitude gap at
$z=0$. A fraction of 33$\pm$16% of the groups simulated are found to be fossil,
whereas the observational estimate is $\sim$10-20%. The FGs are found to be
X-ray over-luminous relative to non-FGs of the same optical luminosity, in
qualitative agreement with observations. Finally, from a dynamical friction
analysis is found that only because infall of $L \sim L_*$ galaxies happens
along filaments with small impact parameters do FGs exist at all.",2005-05-26T20:02:28Z
"X-ray Spectral Evolution of Her X-1 in a Low State and the Following
  Short High State","We analyzed spectral variations of $\sim 8.5$ days long RXTE monitoring
observations of Her X-1 in December 2001. This set of observations enables, for
the first time, frequent continuous monitoring (111 pointings in $\sim 8.5$
days) of the source with RXTE including $\sim 1.7$ days long low state part and
the following $\sim 6.8$ days long short high state part. We used absorbed
power law model with iron line energy complex modeled as a Gaussian to fit both
the 3-60 keV PCA-HEXTE overall short high state spectrum and 3-20 keV
individual PCA spectra. Additional partial cold absorber model was used for
both cases. Using 3-20 keV individual PCA spectra, absorption in anomalous dips
and preeclipse dips in short high state were compared. Decreasing ratio of
unabsorbed flux to absorbed flux with increasing unabsorbed flux in anomalous
and preeclipse dips was interpreted as an evidence of the fact that the regions
causing opaque obscuration and soft absorption are not geometrically far away
from each other. Higher iron line peak energies in low state and short high
state ($\sim 6.6-6.9$ keV) were interpreted as a clue of the presence of iron
line components other than K$\alpha$ emission line.",2005-06-10T06:13:04Z
Limit-cycle behavior in one-zone convective models,"We present the results of a detailed set of one-zone models that account for
the coupling between pulsation and convection following the original
prescriptions of Stellingwerf (1986). Motivated by the arbitrary nature of the
input parameters adopted in this theoretical framework, we computed several
sequences of models that cover a substantial fraction of the parameter space
and a longer integration time. We also included a turbulent pressure term and
found that this physical mechanism plays a crucial role in the pulsation
characteristics of the models by removing the sharp discontinuities along the
light and the velocity curves showed by models that do not account for
turbulent pressure. Finally, we investigated the vibrational and the
pulsational stability of completely convective models. We consider as the most
important finding of the present work the identification of a well-defined
region in the parameter space where they approach limit-cycle stability.
Several numerical experiments performed by adopting different values of the
adiabatic exponent and of the shell thickness indicate that the coupling
between pulsation and convection is the key driving mechanism for LPVs, a
finding supported by recent theoretical predictions.",2005-03-31T13:54:24Z
"Red variables in the OGLE-II data base -- III. Constraints on the
  three-dimensional structures of the LMC and SMC","We present an analysis of the 3-D structure of the Magellanic Clouds, using
period-luminosity (P-L) relations of pulsating red giants in the OGLE-II
sample. By interpreting deviations from the mean P-L relations as distance
modulus variations, we examine the three-dimensional distributions of the
sample. The results for the Large Magellanic Cloud, based solely on stars below
the tip of the Red Giant Branch, confirm previous results on the inclined and
possibly warped bar of the LMC. The depth variation across the OGLE-II field is
about 2.4 kpc, interpreted as the distance range of a thin but inclined
structure. The inclination angle is about 29 deg. A comparison with OGLE-II red
clump distances revealed intriguing differences that seem to be connected to
the red clump reddening correction. A spatially variable red clump population
in the LMC can explain the deviations, which may have a broader impact on our
understanding of the LMC formation history. For the Small Magellanic Cloud, we
find a complex structure showing patchy distribution scattered within 3.2 kpc
of the mean. However, the larger range of the overall depth on every
line-of-sight is likely to smooth out significantly the real variations.",2005-02-22T06:39:12Z
"The extended Lyman-alpha emission surrounding the z=3.04 radio-quiet
  QSO1205-30: Primordial infalling gas illuminated by the quasar?","We present spectroscopic observations obtained with the FORS1 instrument on
the ESO VLT under good seeing conditions of the radio-quiet z_em = 3.04 quasar
Q1205-30 and its associated extended Lyman-alpha emission. The extended
Lyman-alpha emission was originally found in a deep narrow band image targeting
a z_abs = z_em Lyman-limit system in the spectrum of the QSO. Using spectral
point-spread function fitting to subtract the QSO spectrum, we clearly detect
the extended Lyman-alpha emission as well as two foreground galaxies at small
impact parameters (2.12 +- 0.04 and 2.77 +- 0.07 arcsec). The redshifts of the
two foreground galaxies are found to be z = 0.4732 and z = 0.865. We determine
the redshift and velocity profile for the extended Lyman-alpha emission, and
analyzing the velocity offsets between eight QSO emission lines we refine the
quasar redshift determination. We use the new redshifts to infer the geometry
of the complex. We find that the extended Lyman-alpha emission is clearly
associated with the quasar. A Lyman-alpha luminosity of 5.6 x 10^43 erg s^-1
places this extended emission at the high luminosity end of the few previous
detections around radio-quiet quasars. The extended Lyman-alpha emission is
best explained by hydrogen falling into the dark matter halo inhabited by the
quasar.",2005-03-10T12:47:29Z
End-effects in rapidly rotating cylindrical Taylor-Couette flow,"We present numerical simulations of the flow in a rapidly rotating
cylindrical annulus. We show that at the rotation rates relevant to the
magneto-rotational instability, the flow is strongly constrained by the
Taylor-Proudman theorem. As a result, it is controlled almost entirely by the
end-plates. We then consider two possible options for minimizing these
end-effects, namely (i) simply taking a very long cylinder, and (ii) splitting
the end-plates into a series of differentially rotating rings. Regarding option
(i), we show that the cylinder would have to be hundreds of times as long as it
is wide before end-effects become unimportant in the interior. Since this is
clearly not feasible, we turn to option (ii), and show that in order to obtain
a smooth angular velocity profile, the end-plates would have to be split into
around ten rings. If the end-plates are split into fewer rings, perhaps 3-5,
the angular velocity profile will not be smooth, but will instead consist of a
series of Stewartson layers at the boundaries from one ring to the next. We
suggest therefore that the instabilities one obtains in this system will be the
familiar Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities of these Stewartson layers, rather than
the magneto-rotational instability. At best, one might hope to obtain the MRI
superimposed on these Kelvin-Helmholtz modes. Any subsequent interpretation of
results is thus likely to be quite complicated.",2005-06-03T16:04:42Z
"On the gamma-ray spectra radiated by protons accelerated in SNR shocks
  near molecular clouds: The case of SNR RX J1713.7-3946","Cosmic rays (CRs) are thought to be accelerated in SNRs. The most favorable
situation for proving that the main, hadronic CR component is accelerated there
is when CRs interact with dense gases, such as molecular clouds (MC) which
surround the SN shock. Here, a new mechanism of spectrum formation in partially
ionized gases near SNRs is proposed. Using an analytic model of nonlinear
diffusive shock acceleration, we calculate the spectra of protons and estimate
the resulting $\gamma$-ray emission occurring when the SNR shock approaches a
MC. We show that the spectrum develops a break in the TeV range and that its
GeV component is suppressed. These modifications to the standard theory occur
because of the proximity of the partially ionized MC-gas and because of the
physics of particle and Alfven wave propagation inside the gas. Possible
applications of the new spectra to the recent CANGAROO and HESS observations of
the SNR RX J1713.7-3946 are discussed.",2005-03-17T23:14:11Z
A broad iron line in the Chandra/HETG spectrum of 4U 1705-44,"We present the results of a Chandra 30 ks observation of the low mass X-ray
binary and atoll source 4U 1705-44. Here we concentrate on the study of
discrete features in the energy spectrum at energies below 3 keV, as well as on
the iron Kalpha line, using the HETG spectrometer on board of the Chandra
satellite. Below 3 keV, three narrow emission lines are found at 1.47, 2.0, and
2.6 keV. The 1.47 and 2.6 keV are probably identified with Ly-alpha emission
from Mg XII and S XVI, respectively. The identification of the feature at 2.0
keV is uncertain due to the presence of an instrumental feature at the same
energy. The iron Kalpha line at ~6.5 keV is found to be intrinsically broad
(FWHM ~ 1.2 keV); its width can be explained by reflection from a cold
accretion disk extending down to 15 km from the neutron star center or by
Compton broadening in the external parts of a hot (~2 keV) Comptonizing corona.
We finally report here precise X-ray coordinates of the source.",2005-03-09T18:13:12Z
"Photon-axion conversion as a mechanism for supernova dimming: Limits
  from CMB spectral distortion","Axion-photon conversion induced by intergalactic magnetic fields has been
proposed as an explanation for the dimming of distant supernovae of type Ia SNe
Ia) without cosmic acceleration. The effect depends on the intergalactic
electron density $n_e$ as well as the $B$-field strength and domain size. We
show that for $n_e\alt 10^{-9} {\rm cm}^{-3}$ the same mechanism would cause
excessive spectral distortion of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This
small-$n_e$ parameter region had been left open by the most restrictive
previous constraints based on the dispersion of quasar (QSO) spectra. The
combination of CMB and QSO limits suggests that the photon-axion conversion
mechanism can only play a subleading role for SN Ia dimming. A combined
analysis of all the observables affected by the photon-axion oscillations would
be required to give a final verdict on the viability of this model.",2005-06-03T15:35:52Z
Inflationary spectra and partially decohered distributions,"It is generally expected that decoherence processes will erase the quantum
properties of the inflationary primordial spectra. However, given the weakness
of gravitational interactions, one might end up with a distribution which is
only partially decohered. Below a certain critical change, we show that the
inflationary distribution retains quantum properties. We identify four of
these: a squeezed spread in some direction of phase space, non-vanishing
off-diagonal matrix elements, and two properties used in quantum optics called
non-$P$-representability and non-separability. The last two are necessary
conditions to violate Bell's inequalities. The critical value above which all
these properties are lost is associated to the `grain' of coherent states. The
corresponding value of the entropy is equal to half the maximal (thermal)
value. Moreover it coincides with the entropy of the effective distribution
obtained by neglecting the decaying modes. By considering backreaction effects,
we also provide an upper bound for this entropy at the onset of the adiabatic
era.",2005-05-18T14:13:05Z
"Transport and mixing in the radiation zones of rotating stars II.
  Axisymmetric magnetic field","The purpose of this paper is to improve the modeling of the mixing of
chemical elements that occurs in stellar radiation zones. In addition to the
classical rotational mixing considered in our previous paper, which results of
the combined action of the thermally-driven meridional circulation and of the
turbulence generated by the shear of differential rotation, we include here the
effect of an axisymmetric magnetic field in a self-consistent way. We treat the
advection of the field by the meridional circulation, its Ohmic diffusion, and
the production of its toroidal component through the shear of differential
rotation. The Lorentz force is assumed not to exceed the centrifugal force; it
acts on the baroclinic balance and therefore on the meridional flow, and it has
a strong impact on the transport of angular momentum. All variables and
governing equations are expanded in spherical or spherical vectorial functions,
to arbitrary order: this yields a system of partial differential equations in
time and in the radial coordinate, which is ready to be implemented in a
stellar structure code.",2005-06-06T09:20:32Z
"Galactic Gradients, Postbiological Evolution and the Apparent Failure of
  SETI","Motivated by recent developments impacting our view of Fermi's paradox
(absence of extraterrestrials and their manifestations from our past light
cone), we suggest a reassessment of the problem itself, as well as of
strategies employed by SETI projects so far. The need for such reevaluation is
fueled not only by the failure of searches thus far, but also by great advances
recently made in astrophysics, astrobiology, computer science and future
studies, which have remained largely ignored in SETI practice. As an example of
the new approach, we consider the effects of the observed metallicity and
temperature gradients in the Milky Way on the spatial distribution of
hypothetical advanced extraterrestrial intelligent communities. While,
obviously, properties of such communities and their sociological and
technological preferences are entirely unknown, we assume that (1) they operate
in agreement with the known laws of physics, and (2) that at some point they
typically become motivated by a meta-principle embodying the central role of
information-processing; a prototype of the latter is the recently suggested
Intelligence Principle of Steven J. Dick. There are specific conclusions of
practical interest to be drawn from coupling of these reasonable assumptions
with the astrophysical and astrochemical structure of the Galaxy. In
particular, we suggest that the outer regions of the Galactic disk are most
likely locations for advanced SETI targets, and that intelligent communities
will tend to migrate outward through the Galaxy as their capacities of
information-processing increase, for both thermodynamical and astrochemical
reasons. This can also be regarded as a possible generalization of the Galactic
Habitable Zone, concept currently much investigated in astrobiology.",2005-06-06T14:10:44Z
"Terrestrial Planet Formation I. The Transition from Oligarchic Growth to
  Chaotic Growth","We use a hybrid, multiannulus, n-body-coagulation code to investigate the
growth of km-sized planetesimals at 0.4-2 AU around a solar-type star. After a
short runaway growth phase, protoplanets with masses of roughly 10^26 g and
larger form throughout the grid. When (i) the mass in these `oligarchs' is
roughly comparable to the mass in planetesimals and (ii) the surface density in
oligarchs exceeds 2-3 g/sq cm at 1 AU, strong dynamical interactions among
oligarchs produce a high merger rate which leads to the formation of several
terrestrial planets. In disks with lower surface density, milder interactions
produce several lower mass planets. In all disks, the planet formation
timescale is roughly 10-100 Myr, similar to estimates derived from the
cratering record and radiometric data.",2005-03-25T22:08:58Z
"Late internal shock model for bright X-ray flares in Gamma-ray Burst
  afterglows and GRB 011121","We explore two possible models which might give rise to bright X-ray flares
in GRBs afterglows. One is an external forward-reverse shock model, in which
the shock parameters of forward/reverse shocks are taken to be quite different.
The other is a so called ""late internal shock model"", which requires a
refreshed unsteady relativistic outflow generated after the prompt $\gamma-$ray
emission. In the forward-reverse shock model, after the time $t_\times$ at
which the RS crosses the ejecta, the flux declines more slowly than
$(t_\oplus/t_\times)^{-(2+\beta)}$, where $t_\oplus$ denotes the observer's
time and $\beta$ is the spectral index of the X-ray emission. In the ``late
internal shock model"", decaying slopes much steeper than $(t_\oplus/t_{\rm e,
\oplus})^{-(2+\beta)}$ are possible if the central engine shuts down after
$t_{\rm e, \oplus}$ and the observed variability timescale of the X-ray flare
is much shorter than $t_{\rm e, \oplus}$.
  The sharp decline of the X-ray flares detected in GRB 011121, XRF 050406, GRB
050502b, and GRB 050730 rules out the external forward-reverse shock model
directly and favors the ""late internal shock model"". These X-ray flares could
thus hint that the central engine operates again and a new unsteady
relativistic outflow is generated just a few minutes after the intrinsic hard
burst.",2005-06-08T00:21:09Z
Theoretical HDO emission from low-mass protostellar envelopes,"We present theoretical predictions of the rotational line emission of
deuterated water in low-mass protostar collapsing envelopes. The model accounts
for the density and temperature structure of the envelope, according the
inside-out collapse framework. The deuterated water abundance profile is
approximated by a step function, with a low value in the cold outer envelope
and a higher value in the inner envelope where the grain mantles evaporate. The
two abundances are the two main parameters of the modeling, along with the
temperature at which the mantles evaporate. We report line flux predictions for
a 30 and 5 L$_\odot$ source luminosity respectively. We show that ground based
observations are capable to constrain the three parameters of the model in the
case of bright low-mass protostars (L$>$10 L$_{\odot}$), and that no space
based observations, like for example HSO observations, are required in this
case. On the contrary, we show that the study of low-luminosity sources (L$<$10
L$_{\odot}$), assuming the same HDO abundance profile, requires too much

telescopes or with the HIFI instrument on board HSO. For these sources, only
the large interferometer ALMA will allow to constrain the HDO abundance.",2005-06-07T13:11:38Z
"Effects of Pulsar Rotation on Timing Measurements of the Double Pulsar
  System J0737-3039","We study the effect of pulsar rotation on timing of binary pulsars, with
particular emphasis on the double pulsar system J0737-3039. Special
relativistic aberration due to the orbital motion of pulsar changes both the
longitude and colatitude of the emission direction with respect to the pulsar
spin axis. The former gives rise to a shift of the arrival time of the pulse
centroid (this is the conventional ``longitudinal'' aberration delay), the
latter results in a distortion (contraction or dilation) of the pulse profile
on the orbital timescale. The amplitude of pulse distortion depends inversely
on the variation of polarization position angle across the pulse. For small
angle between the pulsar magnetic and spin axes, as inferred for PSR
J0737-3039A from polarimetric observations, the pulse distortion is significant
(\sim 1%) and the associated ``latitudinal'' aberration delay is much larger
than the longitudinal one. By monitoring the arrival time of separate pulse
components as a function of pulsar orbital phase, the latitudinal aberration
delay may be easily measured with the current timing precision, thus
constraining the spin geometry of the system. The latitudinal delay can also be
detected by monitoring system's orbital parameters on the geodetic precession
timescale. Because of the near edge-on orbital orientation of the PSR
J0737-3039 system, general relativistic bending of pulsar A's radio beam near
its superior conjunction also introduces spin-dependent time delays of similar
order of magnitude as the aberration delays. In addition, light bending splits
the pulse profile into two variable components, corresponding to two
gravitationally lensed images of the source. Detection of lensing effects is
challenging, but may be possible with existing technology.",2005-03-21T22:43:10Z
Minimal tau approximation and simulations of the alpha effect,"The validity of a closure called the minimal tau approximation (MTA), is
tested in the context of dynamo theory, wherein triple correlations are assumed
to provide relaxation of the turbulent electromotive force. Under MTA, the
alpha effect in mean field dynamo theory becomes proportional to a relaxation
time scale multiplied by the difference between kinetic and current helicities.
It is shown that the value of the relaxation time is positive and, in units of
the turnover time at the forcing wavenumber, it is of the order of unity. It is
quenched by the magnetic field -- roughly independently of the magnetic
Reynolds number. However, this independence becomes uncertain at large magnetic
Reynolds number. Kinetic and current helicities are shown to be dominated by
large scale properties of the flow.",2005-04-10T01:38:44Z
"Unusual Pulsed X-ray Emission from the Young, High Magnetic Field Pulsar
  PSR J1119-6127","We present XMM-Newton observations of the radio pulsar PSR J1119-6127, which
has an inferred age of 1,700 yr and surface dipole magnetic field strength of
4.1x10^13 G. We report the first detection of pulsed X-ray emission from PSR
J1119-6127. In the 0.5--2.0 keV range, the pulse profile shows a narrow peak
with a very high pulsed fraction of (74 +/- 14)%. In the 2.0--10.0 keV range,
the upper limit for the pulsed fraction is 28% (99% confidence). The pulsed
emission is well described by a thermal blackbody model with a temperature of
T^{\infty} = 2.4^{+0.3}_{-0.2}x10^6 K and emitting radius of 3.4^{+1.8}_{-0.3}
km (at a distance of 8.4 kpc). Atmospheric models result in problematic
estimates for the distance/emitting area. PSR J1119-6127 is now the radio
pulsar with smallest characteristic age from which thermal X-ray emission has
been detected. The combined temporal and spectral characteristics of this
emission are unlike those of other radio pulsars detected at X-ray energies and
challenge current models of thermal emission from neutron stars.",2005-05-16T21:51:40Z
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Quasar Catalog III. Third Data Release,"We present the third edition of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Quasar
Catalog. The catalog consists of the 46,420 objects in the SDSS Third Data
Release that have luminosities larger than M_i = -22 (in a cosmology with H_0 =
70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.3, and Omega_Lambda = 0.7), have at least one emission
line with FWHM larger than 1000 km/s or are unambiguously broad absorption line
quasars, are fainter than i = 15.0, and have highly reliable redshifts. The
area covered by the catalog is 4188 sq. deg. The quasar redshifts range from
0.08 to 5.41, with a median value of 1.47; the high-redshift sample includes
520 quasars at redshifts greater than four, of which 17 are at redshifts
greater than five. For each object the catalog presents positions accurate to
better than 0.2 arcsec. rms per coordinate, five-band (ugriz) CCD-based
photometry with typical accuracy of 0.03 mag, and information on the morphology
and selection method. The catalog also contains radio, near-infrared, and X-ray
emission properties of the quasars, when available, from other large-area
surveys. The calibrated digital spectra cover the wavelength region 3800--9200A
at a spectral resolution about 2000; the spectra can be retrieved from the
public database using the information provided in the catalog. A total of
44,221 objects in the catalog were discovered by the SDSS; 28,400 of the SDSS
discoveries are reported here for the first time.",2005-03-30T21:55:34Z
"Effects of gravitational darkening on the determination of fundamental
  parameters in fast rotating B-type stars","In this paper we develop a calculation code to account for the effects
carried by fast rotation on the observed spectra of early-type stars. Stars are
assumed to be in rigid rotation and the grid of plane-parallel model
atmospheres used to represent the gravitational darkening are calculated by
means of a non-LTE approach. Attention is paid on the relation between the
apparent and parent non-rotating counterpart stellar fundamental parameters and
apparent and true vsini parameters as a function of the rotation rate
Omega/Omega_c, stellar mass and inclination angle. It is shown that omission of
gravitational darkening in the analysis of chemical abundances of CNO elements
can produce systematic overestimation or underestimation, depending on the
lines used, rotational rate and inclination angle. The proximity of Be stars to
the critical rotation is re-discussed by correcting not only the vsini of 130
Be stars, but also their effective temperature and gravity to account for
stellar rotationally induced geometrical distortion and for the concomitant
gravitational darkening effect. We concluded that the increase of the vsini
estimate is accompanied by an even higher value of the stellar equatorial
critical velocity, so that the most probable average rate of angular velocity
of Be stars attains Omega/Omega_c ~ 0.88.",2005-03-17T17:33:27Z
Discovery of NeVII in the Winds of Hot Evolved Stars,"We show that a strong P-Cygni feature seen in the far-UV spectra of some very
hot (Teff >~ 85 kK) central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPN), which has been
previously identified as CIII lambda 977, actually originates from NeVII lambda
973. Using stellar atmospheres models, we reproduce this feature seen in the
spectra of two [WR]-PG 1159 type CSPN, Abell 78 and NGC 2371, and in one PG
1159 CSPN, K 1-16. In the latter case, our analysis suggests an enhanced neon
abundance. Strong neon features in CSPN spectra are important because an
overabundance of this element is indicative of processed material that has been
dredged up to the surface from the inter-shell region in the ``born-again''
scenario, an explanation of hydrogen-deficient CSPN. Our modeling indicates the
NeVII lambda 973 wind feature may be used to discern enhanced neon abundances
for stars showing an unsaturated P-Cygni profile, such as some PG 1159 stars.
We explore the potential of this strong feature as a wind diagnostic in stellar
atmospheres analyses for evolved objects. For the [WR]-PG 1159 objects, the
line is present as a P-Cygni line for Teff >~ 85 kK, and becomes strong for 100
<~ Teff <~ 155 kK when the neon abundance is solar, and can be significantly
strong beyond this range for higher neon abundances. When unsaturated, i.e.,
for very high Teff and/or very low mass-loss rates, it is sensitive to Mdot and
very sensitive to the neon abundance. The NeVII classification is consistent
with recent identification of this line seen in absorption in many PG 1159
spectra.",2005-02-03T17:03:02Z
Predicting the CMB power spectrum for binary polyhedral spaces,"The COBE and the first-year WMAP data both find the CMB quadrupole and
octopole to be anomalously low. Here it is shown, that a finite,
multi-connected universe may explain this anomaly, supporting earlier analyses
[5][18]. A novel technique, pioneered by [16] is used to compute the spectrum
and its variance up to k=102. Based on the properties of the Lie group of
rotations of S^3 it is shown that the spectrum and its variance may be computed
solely from the matrix elements of the group-averaging operator, for each of
the manifolds S^3/I^*, S^3/O^* and S^3/T^*. Further, it is proved that the
spectrum of the CMB may be calculated solely from the radial function, due to
the symmetry properties of the Lie-algebra, which is rigorously proven. It is
shown, that if the topology of the universe is S^3/I^* the uncertainty on the
estimates for the total energy density of the universe may be reduced by an
order of magnitude. Finally, the paper highlights how the unavailability of an
explicit probability function for the observations, given the model, is a
challenge for Monte-Carlo simulations of the binary polyhedral spaces which has
to be addressed in future work.",2005-03-01T16:17:28Z
"The Hamburg/ESO R-process Enhanced Star survey (HERES) II. Spectroscopic
  analysis of the survey sample","We present the results of analysis of ``snapshot'' spectra of 253 metal-poor
halo stars -3.8 < [Fe/H] < -1.5 obtained in the HERES survey. The spectra are
analysed using an automated line profile analysis method based on the
Spectroscopy Made Easy codes of Valenti & Piskunov. Elemental abundances of
moderate precision have been obtained for 22 elements, C, Mg, Al, Ca, Sc, Ti,
V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Eu, where
detectable. Among the sample of 253 stars, we find 8 r-II stars and 35 r-I
stars. We also find three stars with strong enhancements of Eu which are
s-process rich. A significant number of new very metal-poor stars are
confirmed: 49 stars with [Fe/H] < -3 and 181 stars with -3 < [Fe/H] < -2. We
find one star with [Fe/H] < -3.5. We find the scatter in the abundance ratios
of Mg, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Fe, Co, and Ni, with respect to Fe and Mg, to be similar
to the estimated relative errors and thus the cosmic scatter to be small,
perhaps even non-existent. The elements C, Sr, Y, Ba and Eu, and perhaps Zr,
show scatter at [Fe/H] < -2.5 significantly larger than can be explained from
the errors in the analysis, implying scatter which is cosmic in origin.
Significant scatter is observed in abundance ratios between light and heavy
neutron-capture elements at low metallicity and low levels of r-process
enrichment. (*** abridged ***)",2005-05-03T08:48:47Z
"Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays from charged black holes. A new
  theoretical possibility?","In General Relativity, there is a new field of activity concerning the study
of charged stars. In a recent paper, Ray et al. have shown the possibility that
the collapse of a charged star could form a charged black hole before all the
charge leaves the system. In this field of view we propose a new model for
UHECR and we will show that it is possible to accelerate cosmic rays up to EeV.
In this talk we will compute the UHECR flux, the charged black hole density and
the energy spectrum associated with them in order to reproduce experimental
data. We will see that we need only a small number of these hidden sources in
order to account for observed UHECR properties and we will study the limits on
charge and mass of black holes.",2005-05-31T10:16:00Z
The Dust Depletion and Extinction of the GRB 020813 Afterglow,"The Keck optical spectrum of the GRB 020813 afterglow is the best ever
obtained for GRBs. Its large spectral range and very high S/N ratio allowed for
the first time the detection of a vast variety of absorption lines, associated
with the circumburst medium or interstellar medium of the host. The remarkable
similarity of the relative abundances of 8 elements with the dust depletion
pattern seen in the Galactic ISM suggests the presence of dust. The derived
visual dust extinction A_V=0.40+/-0.06 contradicts the featureless UV spectrum
of the afterglow, very well described by a unreddened power law. The
forthcoming Swift era will open exciting opportunities to explain similar
phenomena in other GRB afterglows.",2005-06-02T15:54:14Z
"Spectroscopy and Stellar Populations of Star-forming Galaxies at z~3 in
  the Hubble Deep Field - South","We present results of VLT/FORS2 spectroscopy of galaxies at z~3 in the Hubble
Deep Field-South (HDF-S). A sample of galaxies was drawn from the photo-z
catalogue based on the HST/WFPC2 optical images and the deep near-infrared
images obtained with VLT/ISAAC as a part of the FIRES project. We selected
galaxies with photometric redshift between 2.5 and 4. Most of the selected
galaxies are bright in rest-frame UV wavelengths and satisfy color selection
criteria of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at z~3. The number of target galaxies
with I(AB)<25.0 was 15. We identified new 5 firm and 2 probable redshifts in
addition to confirmations of previously known 6 galaxies at z~3. We found 6
among these 13 galaxies lie at a quite narrow redshift range at z = 2.80+-0.01.
We examined stellar populations of the galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts
through comparisons of their optical and near-IR photometry data with template
spectra generated by a population synthesis code. The ages from the onset of
star formation for these star-forming galaxies with I<=25.0 are typically
50-200 Myr, and their stellar masses are between (0.5-5) x 10^10 M_sun,
consistent with previous studies. We also compared these SED fitting results
with those for distant red galaxies (DRGs) at z>2 discovered by FIRES. DRGs
have larger stellar masses, larger dust attenuation than our UV-luminous LBG
sample, and their star formation rates are often comparable to LBGs. These
trends suggest that majority of DRGs are indeed the most massive systems at the
redshift and are still in the active star-forming phase. Unless the number
density of DRGs is much smaller than LBGs, estimates based on UV selected
sample could miss substantial part of stellar mass density at z~3.",2005-05-26T10:21:48Z
Observational Tests of Intergalactic Enrichment Models,"We summarize recent results assessing the carbon and silicon abundances of
the intergalactic medium (IGM) using the `pixel optical depth' technique. We
briefly discuss the implications of these results for models of intergalactic
enrichment, focusing on distinguishing `early' z >> 4 enrichment by the first
generations of stars and objects from `late' enrichment by 2 < z < 5 Ly-break
galaxies. We then discuss the comparison of observed QSO spectra to simulated
spectra generated from cosmological simulations that self-consistently include
enrichment, and draw qualitative implications for the general picture of
intergalactic enrichment at z > 2.",2005-04-19T23:19:02Z
A sample of radio-loud AGN in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,"A sample of 2712 radio-luminous galaxies is defined from the second data
release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) by cross-comparing the main
spectroscopic galaxy sample with two radio surveys: the NRAO VLA Sky Survey
(NVSS) and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimetres (FIRST)
survey. The comparison is carried out in a multi-stage process and makes
optimal use of both radio surveys by exploiting the sensitivity of the NVSS to
extended and multi-component radio sources in addition to the high angular
resolution of the FIRST images. A radio source sample with 95% completeness and
98.9% reliability is achieved, far better than would be possible for this
sample if only one of the surveys was used. The radio source sample is then
divided into two classes: radio-loud AGN and galaxies in which the radio
emission is dominated by star formation. The division is based on the location
of a galaxy in the plane of 4000Ang break strength versus radio luminosity per
unit stellar mass and provides a sample of 2215 radio-loud AGN and 497 star
forming galaxies brighter than 5mJy at 1.4GHz. A full catalogue of positions
and radio properties is provided for these sources. The local radio luminosity
function is then derived both for radio-loud AGN and for star-forming galaxies
and is found to be in agreement with previous studies. By using the radio to
far-IR correlation, the radio luminosity function of star forming galaxies is
also compared to the luminosity function derived in the far-infrared. It is
found to agree well at high luminosities but less so at lower luminosities,
confirming that the linearity of the radio to far-IR correlation breaks down
below about 10^22 W/Hz at 1.4GHz.",2005-06-13T15:18:01Z
The X-ray luminosity function and number counts of spiral galaxies,"(abridged) A detailed comparison is performed of the LFs compiled at
infrared, radio and optical wavelengths and converted into XLFs using available
relations with the XLF directly estimated in the 0.5--2 keV energy band from
X-ray surveys (Norman et al). We find that the XLF from the local sample of
IRAS galaxies (Takeuchi et al) provides a good representation of all available
data samples; pure luminosity evolution of the form (1+z)^\eta, with \eta< ~3,
is favoured over pure density. The local X-ray luminosity density is also well
defined. We discuss different estimates of the galaxies LogN-LogS, selected
from the Chandra Deep Fields with different selection criteria: these have
similar slopes, but normalisations scattered within a factor ~2, of the same
order of the Poissonian error on the counts. We compare the observed LogN-LogS
with the counts predicted by integrating our reference z=0 XLF. By using number
counts alone, it is not possible to discriminate between density and luminosity
evolution; however, the evolution of galaxies must be stopped in both cases at
z~1-2. The contribution of galaxies to the X-ray background is found to be in
the range 6%--12%. Making use of cosmic star formation models, we find that the
X-ray LogN-LogS might be not compatible with very large star formation rates at
z ~ 3 as suggested by sub-mm observations in Blain et al. 1999. As to the
content of current and, possibly, future X-ray surveys, we determine the
fraction of galaxies around the current flux limit: (30+-12 %). At fainter
fluxes the fraction of galaxies will probably rise, and overcome the counts
from AGN at fluxes < ~10^{-17} erg/s/cm^2.",2005-03-23T17:10:22Z
Cosmological Constraints on a Dynamical Electron Mass,"Motivated by recent astrophysical observations of quasar absorption systems,
we formulate a simple theory where the electron to proton mass ratio $\mu
=m_{e}/m_{p}$ is allowed to vary in space-time. In such a minimal theory only
the electron mass varies, with $\alpha $ and $m_{p}$ kept constant. We find
that changes in $\mu $ will be driven by the electronic energy density after
the electron mass threshold is crossed. Particle production in this scenario is
negligible. The cosmological constraints imposed by recent astronomical
observations are very weak, due to the low mass density in electrons. Unlike in
similar theories for spacetime variation of the fine structure constant, the
observational constraints on variations in $\mu $ imposed by the weak
equivalence principle are much more stringent constraints than those from
quasar spectra. Any time-variation in the electron-proton mass ratio must be
less than one part in $10^{9}$since redshifts $z\approx 1.$This is more than
one thousand times smaller than current spectroscopic sensitivities can
achieve. Astronomically observable variations in the electron-proton must
therefore arise directly from effects induced by varying fine structure
'constant' or by processes associated with internal proton structure. We also
place a new upper bound of $2\times 10^{-8}$ on any large-scale spatial
variation of $\mu $ that is compatible with the isotropy of the microwave
background radiation.",2005-03-09T17:08:48Z
"An XMM-Newton observation of the multiple system HD167971 (O5-8V + O5-8V
  + (O8I)) and the young open cluster NGC6604","We discuss the results of two XMM-Newton observations of the open cluster
NGC6604 obtained in April and September 2002. We concentrate mainly on the
multiple system HD167971 (O5-8V + O5-8V + (O8I)). The soft part of the EPIC
spectrum of this system is thermal with typical temperatures of about 2 10^6 to
9 10^6 K. The nature (thermal vs non-thermal) of the hard part of the spectrum
is not unambiguously revealed by our data. If the emission is thermal, the high
temperature of the plasma (~ 2.3 10^7 to 4.6 10^7 K) would be typical of what
should be expected from a wind-wind interaction zone within a long period
binary system. This emission could arise from an interaction between the
combined winds of the O5-8V + O5-8V close binary system and that of the more
distant O8I companion. Assuming instead that the hard part of the spectrum is
non-thermal, the photon index would be rather steep (~3). Moreover, a marginal
variability between our two XMM-Newton pointings could be attributed to an
eclipse of the O5-8V + O5-8V system. The overall X-ray luminosity points to a
significant X-ray luminosity excess of about a factor 4 possibly due to
colliding winds. Considering HD167971 along with several recent X-ray and radio
observations, we propose that the simultaneous observation of non-thermal
radiation in the X-ray (below 10.0 keV) and radio domains appears rather
unlikely. Our investigation of our XMM-Newton data of NGC6604 reveals a rather
sparse distribution of X-ray emitters. Including the two bright non-thermal
radio emitters HD168112 and HD167971, we present a list of 31 X-ray sources...

"The distance to Hydra and Centaurus from surface brightness
  fluctuations: Consequences for the Great Attractor model","We present I-band Surface Brightness Fluctuations (SBF) measurements for 16
early type galaxies (3 giants, 13 dwarfs) in the central region of the Hydra
cluster, based on deep photometric data in 7 fields obtained with VLT FORS1.
  From the SBF-distances to the galaxies in our sample we estimate the distance
of the Hydra cluster to be 41.2 +/- 1.4 Mpc ((m-M)=33.07 +/- 0.07 mag). Based
on an improved correction for fluctuations from undetected point sources, we
revise the SBF-distance to the Centaurus cluster from Mieske & Hilker (2003)
upwards by 10% to 45.3 +/- 2.0 Mpc ((m-M)=33.28 +/- 0.09 mag). The relative
distance modulus of the two clusters then is (m-M)_Cen - (m-M)_Hyd = 0.21 +/-
0.11 mag. With H_0=72 +/- 4 km/s/Mpc, we estimate a positive peculiar velocity
of 1225 +/- 235 km/s for Hydra and 210 +/- 295 km/s for the Cen30 component of
Centaurus. Allowing for a thermal velocity dispersion of 200 km/s, this rules
out a common peculiar flow velocity for both clusters at 98% confidence. We
find that the 9*10^{15} M_{sun} ``Great Attractor'' from the flow study of
Tonry et al. (2000) at a distance of ~45 Mpc can explain the observed peculiar
velocities if shifted about 15 degrees towards the Hydra cluster position. Our
results are inconsistent at 94% confidence with a scenario where the Centaurus
cluster is identical to the Great Attractor. In order to better restrict
partially degenerate Great Attractor parameters like its mass and distance, a
recalculation of the local flow model with updated distance information over a
larger area than covered by us would be needed.",2005-03-30T10:19:38Z
"The host galaxies of radio-loud AGN: mass dependencies, gas cooling and
  AGN feedback","The properties of the host galaxies of a well-defined sample of 2215
radio-loud AGN with redshifts 0.03 < z < 0.3, defined from the SDSS, are
investigated. These are predominantly low radio luminosity sources, with 1.4GHz
luminosities of 10^23 to 10^25 W/Hz. The fraction of galaxies that host
radio-loud AGN with L(1.4GHz) > 10^23 W/Hz is a strong function of stellar
mass, rising from nearly zero below a stellar mass of 10^10 Msun to more than
30% at 5x10^11 Msun. The integral radio luminosity function is derived in six
ranges of stellar and black hole mass. Its shape is very similar in all of
these ranges and can be well fitted by a broken power-law. Its normalisation
varies strongly with mass, as M_*^2.5 or M_BH^1.6; this scaling only begins to
break down when the predicted radio-loud fraction exceeds 20-30%. There is no
correlation between radio and emission line luminosities for the radio-loud AGN
in the sample and the probability that a galaxy of given mass is radio-loud is
independent of whether it is optically classified as an AGN. The host galaxies
of the radio-loud AGN have properties similar to those of ordinary galaxies of
the same mass.
  All of these findings support the conclusion that the optical AGN and low
radio luminosity AGN phenomena are independent and are triggered by different
physical mechanisms. Intriguingly, the dependence on black hole mass of the
radio-loud AGN fraction mirrors that of the rate at which gas cools from the
hot atmospheres of elliptical galaxies. It is speculated that gas cooling
provides a natural explanation for the origin of the radio-loud AGN activity,
and it is argued that AGN heating could plausibly balance the cooling of the
gas over time. [Abridged]",2005-06-13T15:23:24Z
Branes in Supernova Shells,"This paper is firstly intended to review shortly the most recent developments
and ideas resulting from the necessity of having a scale at which gravitation
to unify the other fundamental forces. With the declared intention of
predicting an {\it in situ} distinct possibility for Kaluza-Klein gravitons
formation in the supernova shell we are using state of the art simulations
\citep{langer,ud1,ud2,ud3} for massive stellar winds to infer that the
supernova shock which will hit such winds will meet a non-isotropic and
non-homogeneous matter distribution with a very distinct geometry. By linking
this to the mechanism of particle shock acceleration at cosmic ray energies
(Fermi acceleration) and the related spallation in the wind shell, the result
is the creation of proper conditions for Kaluza-Klein gravitons formation in
the supernova shell from neutrino secondary particles (cosmic ray spallation
products) interacting with $\sim 10^{18}$ eV cosmic rays.",2005-05-25T11:24:47Z
Grain Evolution across the Shocks in the L1448-mm Outflow,"The recent detection of shock-precursors toward the very young L1448-mm
outflow offers us the possibility to study the grain chemistry during the first
stages of the shock evolution, constraining the molecules ejected from grains
and the species formed in gas phase. Observations of key molecules in the grain
chemistry such as SiO, CH3OH, SO, CS, H2S, OCS, and SO2 toward this outflow are
presented. The line profiles and the derived abundances show three distinct
velocity regimes that trace the shock evolution: the preshock, the
shock-precursor and the postshock gas. The SiO, CH3OH, SO, and CS abundances
are enhanced with respect to the quiescent gas by 1 order of magnitude in the
shock-precursor component, and by 3 orders of magnitude in the postshock gas.
The derived SiO and CH3OH abundances are consistent with the recent ejection of
these molecules from grains. Since H2S is only enhanced in the shock-precursor
component, and OCS and SO2 are undetected, SO and CS are the most abundant
sulfur-bearing species in the grain mantles of L1448-mm. The ejection of mainly
SO and CS rather than H2S or OCS from grains, suggests that the sulfur
chemistry will depend on the chemical ""history"" of the grain mantles in
outflows and hot cores.",2005-06-17T11:21:15Z
Rapid growth of high redshift black holes,"We discuss a model for the early assembly of supermassive black holes (SMBHs)
at the center of galaxies that trace their hierarchical build-up far up in the
dark halo `merger tree'. Motivated by the observations of luminous quasars
around redshift z=6 with SMBH masses of billion solar masses, we assess the
possibility of an early phase of stable super-critical quasi-spherical
accretion in the BHs hosted by metal free halos with virial temperature larger
than 10000 K. We assume that the first `seed' black holes formed with
intermediate masses following the collapse of the first generation of stars, in
mini-halos collapsing at z=20-30 from high peaks of density fluctuations. In
high redshift halos with virial temperature larger than 10000 K, conditions
exist for the formation of a fat disc of gas at T_gas=5000-10000 K. Cooling via
hydrogen atomic lines is in fact effective in these comparatively massive
halos. The cooling and collapse of an initially spherical configuration of gas
leads to a rotationally supported disc at the center of the halo if baryons
preserve their specific angular momentum during collapse. The conditions for
the formation of the gas disc and accretion onto a central black holes out of
this supply of gas are investigated, as well as the feedback of the emission
onto the host and onto the intergalactic medium. We find that even a short
phase of supercritical accretion eases the requirements set by the z=6 quasars.",2005-06-02T14:38:08Z
"Attenuation law of normal disc galaxies with clumpy distributions of
  stars and dust","We investigate the attenuation law seen through an interstellar medium (ISM)
with clumpy spatial distributions of stars and dust. The clumpiness of the dust
distribution is introduced by a multi-phase ISM model. We solve a set of
radiative transfer equations with multiple anisotropic scatterings through the
clumpy ISM in a 1-D plane-parallel geometry by using the mega-grain
approximation, in which dusty clumps are regarded as very large particles (i.e.
mega-grains). The clumpiness of the stellar distribution is introduced by the
youngest stars embedded in the clumps. We assume a smooth spatial distribution
for older stars. The youngest stars are surrounded by denser dusty gas and
suffer stronger attenuation than diffuse older stars (i.e. age-selective
attenuation). The apparent attenuation law is a composite of the attenuation
laws for the clumpy younger stars and for the diffuse older stars with a
luminosity weight. In general, the stellar population dominating the luminosity
changes from older stars to younger stars as the wavelength decreases. This
makes the attenuation law steep; the composite attenuation rapidly increases
from small attenuation for older stars at a long wavelength to large
attenuation for younger stars at a short wavelength. The resultant attenuation
law of normal disc galaxies is expected to be much steeper than that of
starburst galaxies observed by Calzetti et al. Finally, the Calzetti's
attenuation law is regarded as a special case with a large density in our
framework.",2005-02-03T13:24:04Z
"Accounting for anisoplanatic point spread function in deep wide-field
  adaptive optics images","In this paper we present the approach we have used to determine and account
for the anisoplanatic point spread function (PSF) in deep adaptive optics (AO)
images for the Survey of a Wide Area with NACO (SWAN) at the ESO VLT. The
survey comprises adaptive optics observations in the Ks band totaling ~ 30
arcmin^2, assembled from 42 discrete fields centered on different bright stars
suitable for AO guiding. We develop a parametric model of the PSF variations
across the field of view in order to build an accurate model PSF for every
galaxy detected in each of the fields. We show that this approach is
particularly convenient, as it uses only easily available data and makes no
uncertain assumptions about the stability of the isoplanatic angle during any
given night. The model was tested using simulated galaxy profiles to check its
performance in terms of recovering the correct morphological parameters; we
find that the results are reliable up to Ks ~ 20.5 (K_AB ~ 22.3) in a typical
SWAN field. Finally, the model obtained was used to derive the first results
from five SWAN fields, and to obtain the AO morphology of 55 galaxies brighter
than Ks = 20. These preliminary results demonstrate the unique power of AO
observations to derive the details of faint galaxy morphologies and to study
galaxy evolution.",2005-04-21T13:42:24Z
"The effect of a finite mass reservoir on the collapse of spherical
  isothermal clouds and the evolution of protostellar accretion","Motivated by recent observations which detect an outer boundary for starless
cores, and evidence for time-dependent mass accretion in the Class 0 and Class
I protostellar phases, we reexamine the case of spherical isothermal collapse
in the case of a finite mass reservoir. The presence of a core boundary results
in the generation of an inward propagating rarefaction wave. This steepens the
gas density profile from r^{-2} to r^{-3} or steeper. After a protostar forms,
the mass accretion rate \dot{M} evolves through three distinct phases: (1) an
early phase of decline in \dot{M}, which is a non-self-similar effect due to
spatially nonuniform infall in the prestellar phase; (2) for large cores, an
intermediate phase of near-constant \dot{M} from the infall of the outer part
of the self-similar density profile; (3) a late phase of rapid decline in
\dot{M} when accretion occurs from the region affected by the inward
propagating rarefaction wave. Our model clouds of small to intermediate size
make a direct transition from phase (1) to phase (3) above. Both the first and
second phase are characterized by a temporally increasing bolometric luminosity
L_bol, while L_bol is decreasing in the third (final) phase. We identify the
period of temporally increasing L_bol with the Class 0 phase, and the later
period of terminal accretion and decreasing L_bol with the Class I phase. The
peak in L_bol corresponds to the evolutionary time when 50% \pm 10% of the
cloud mass has been accreted by the protostar. This is in agreement with the
classification scheme proposed by Andre et al. (1993). We show how our results
can be used to explain tracks of envelope mass M_env versus L_bol for
protostars in Taurus and Ophiuchus. We also develop an analytic formalism which
reproduces the protostellar accretion rate.",2005-04-03T18:35:51Z
"Early BVRcIc imaging and the discovery of the optical afterglow of GRB
  041218","We report early BVRcIc imaging of the INTEGRAL GRB 041218. The observation
started 129 s after the burst and a sequence of exposures in V, Rc, Ic, and B
bands were repeated. The optical afterglow is detected in Rc and Ic bands while
it was not detected in B and V. We find that the early afterglow deviates from
a single power law decay and identify two characteristic timescales (breaks).
Such breaks are theoretically expected from synchrotron cooling in the
relativistic fireball (Sari et al. 1998) and we crudely constrain the physical
condition of the relativistic shock.",2005-05-12T00:53:40Z
"Analytic Gravitational-Force Calculations for Models of the Kuiper Belt,
  with Application to the Pioneer Anomaly","We use analytic techniques to study the gravitational force that would be
produced by different Kuiper-Belt mass distributions. In particular, we study
the 3-dimensional rings (and wedge) whose densities vary as the inverse of the
distance, as a constant, as the inverse-squared of the distance, as well as
that which varies according to the Boss-Peale model. These analytic
calculations yield physical insight into the physics of the problem. They also
verify that physically viable models of this type can produce neither the
magnitude nor the constancy of the Pioneer anomaly.",2005-06-13T18:07:47Z
"The imprints of local superclusters on the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signals
  and their detectability with Planck","We use high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of large-scale structure
formation to study the imprints of the local superclusters onto the full-sky
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signals. Following (Mathis et al. 2002), the initial
conditions have been statistically constrained to reproduce the density field
within a sphere of 110 Mpc around the Milky Way, as observed in the IRAS 1.2-Jy
all-sky redshift survey. As a result, the positions and masses of prominent
galaxy clusters and superclusters in our simulations coincide closely with
their real counterparts in the local universe. We present the results of two
different runs, one with adiabatic gas physics only, and one also including
cooling, star formation and feedback. By analysing the full-sky maps for the
thermal and kinetic SZ signals extracted from these simulations, we find that
for multipoles with l<100 the power spectrum is dominated by the prominent
local superclusters, and its amplitude at these scales is a factor of two
higher than that obtained from unconstrained simulations; at lower multipoles
(l<20) this factor can even reach one order of magnitude. We check the
influence of the SZ effect from local superclusters on the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) power spectrum at small multipoles and find it negligible and
with no signs of quadrupole-octopole alignment. However, performing simulations
of the CMB radiation including the experimental noise at the frequencies which
will be observed by the Planck satellite, we find results suggesting that an
estimate of the SZ power spectrum at large scales can be extracted.",2005-05-12T14:43:53Z
The IRAC galaxy correlation functions from SWIRE,"We present an analysis of large-scale structure from the Spitzer Wide-area
Infrared Extragalactic legacy survey, SWIRE. The two-point angular correlation
functions were computed for galaxies detected in the 3.6-micron IRAC band, on
angular scales up to a degree. Significant evolution in the clustering
amplitude was detected, as the median redshift of the samples increases from
z=0.2 to 0.6. The galaxy clustering in the GALICS semi-analytic models was
compared with the observed correlation functions and found to disagree with the
data at faint flux limits.",2005-03-02T14:49:01Z
Superadiabatic-type magnetic amplification in conventional cosmology,"We consider the evolution of cosmological magnetic fields in FRW models and
outline a geometrical mechanism for their superadiabatic amplification on large
scales. The mechanism operates within standard electromagnetic theory and
applies to FRW universes with open spatial sections. We discuss the general
relativistic nature of the effect and show how it modifies the adiabatic
magnetic evolution. Assuming a universe that is only marginally open today, we
estimate the main features of the superadiabatically amplified residual field.",2005-04-05T16:54:41Z
"Internal Shocks in the Magnetic Reconnection Jet in Solar Flares:
  Multiple Fast Shocks Created by the Secondary Tearing Instability","Space solar missions such as {\it Yohkoh} and {\it RHESSI} observe the hard
X- and gamma-ray emission from energetic electrons in impulsive solar flares.
Their energization mechanism, however, is unknown. In this paper, we suggest
that the internal shocks are created in the reconnection jet and that they are
possible sites of particle acceleration. We examine how magnetic reconnection
creates the multiple shocks by performing two-dimensional resistive
magnetohydrodynamic simulations. In this paper, we use a very small grid to
resolve the diffusion region. As a result, we find that the current sheet
becomes thin due to the tearing instability, and it collapses to a Sweet-Parker
sheet. The thin sheet becomes unstable to the secondary tearing instability.
Fast reconnection starts by the onset of anomalous resistivity immediately
after the secondary tearing instability. During the bursty, time-dependent
magnetic reconnection, the secondary tearing instability continues in the
diffusion region where the anomalous resistivity is enhanced. As a result, many
weak shocks are created in the reconnection jet. This situation produces
turbulent reconnection. We suggest that multiple fast shocks are created in the
jet and that the energetic electrons can be accelerated by these shocks.",2005-02-28T21:38:51Z
"Coupled Quintessence in a Power-Law Case and the Cosmic Coincidence
  Problem","The problem of the cosmic coincidence is a longstanding puzzle. This
conundrum may be solved by introducing a coupling between the two dark sectors.
In this Letter, we study a coupled quintessence scenario in which the scalar
field evolves in a power law potential and the mass of dark matter particles
depends on a power law function of $\phi$. It is shown that this scenario has a
stable attractor solution and can thus provide a natural solution to the cosmic
coincidence problem.",2005-03-03T13:48:47Z
The updated E_peak - E_gamma correlation in GRBs,"The recently discovered correlation between the rest frame GRB peak spectral
energy $E_{\rm peak}$ and the collimation corrected energy $E_\gamma$ in long
GRBs is potentially very important, yet awaits confirmation from an independent
sample. It may help to shed light on the radiation mechanism of the prompt GRB
phase and on the way -- and in which form -- the energy is released from the
central engine. We here present some additional evidence for the correlation
(two new bursts) and re-derive the best-fit parameters. The tightness of the
correlation is confirmed (sigma=0.1 dex). We show that this correlation allows
us, for the first time, to use GRBs as cosmological probes to constrain the
expansion history of the universe.",2005-04-07T17:10:46Z
"The faint supernova remnant G 116.5+1.1 and the detection of a new
  candidate remnant","The extended supernova remnant G 116.5+1.1 was observed in the optical
emission lines of Halpha+[N II], [S II] and [O III]; deep long-slit spectra
were also obtained. The morphology of the remnant's observed emission is mainly
diffuse and patchy in contrast to the known filamentary emission seen along the
western limb. The bulk of the detected emission in the region appears unrelated
to the remnant but there is one area of emission in the south-east which is
characterized by a [S II]/Halpha ratio of ~0.5, implying a possible relation to
G 116.5+1.1. If this is actually the case, it would imply a more extended
remnant than previously realized. Emission in the [O III] 5007 A line image is
not detected, excluding moderate or fast velocity shocks running into ionized
interstellar clouds. Our current estimate of the distance to G 116.5+1.1 of ~3
kpc is in agreement with earlier estimates and implies a very extended remnant
(69 pc x 45 pc). Observations further to the north-east of G 116.5+1.1 revealed
a network of filamentary structures prominent in Halpha+[N II] and [S II] but
failed to detect [O III] line emission. Long-slit spectra in a number of
positions provide strong evidence that this newly detected emission arises from
shock heated gas. Typical Halpha fluxes lie in the range of 9 to 17 x10^{-17}
erg/s/cm^2/ arcsec^2, while low electron densities are implied by the
intensities of the sulfur lines. Weak emission from the medium ionization line
at 5007 A is detected in only one spectrum. Cool dust emission at 60 and 100
microns may be correlated with the optical emission in a limited number of
positions. Surpisingly, radio emission is not detected in published surveys
suggesting that the new candidate remnant may belong to the class of ""radio
quiet"" supernova remnants.",2005-02-03T12:55:22Z
"Spectroscopic Studies of Very Metal-Poor Stars with the Subaru High
  Dispersion Spectrograph. III. Light Neutron-Capture Elements","Elemental abundance measurements have been obtained for a sample of 18 very
metal-poor stars using spectra obtained with the Subaru Telescope High
Dispersion Spectrograph. Seventeen stars, among which 16 are newly analyzed in
the present work, were selected from candidate metal-poor stars identified in
the HK survey of Beers and colleagues. The metallicity range covered by our
sample is -3.1 ~< [Fe/H] ~< -2.4. The abundances of carbon, alpha-elements, and
iron-peak elements determined for these stars confirm the trends found by
previous work. One exception is the large over-abundance of Mg, Al and Sc found
in BS16934--002, a giant with [Fe/H] = -2.8. By combining our new results with
those of previous studies, we investigate the distribution of neutron-capture
elements in very metal-poor stars, focusing on the production of the light
neutron-capture elements (e.g., Sr, Y, and Zr).",2005-03-02T07:08:44Z
Absolute magnitudes for late-type dwarf stars for Sloan photometry,"We present a new formula for absolute magnitude determination for late-type
dwarf stars as a function of (g-r) and (r-i) for Sloan photometry. The absolute
magnitudes estimated by this approach are brighter than those estimated by
colour-magnitude diagrams, and they reduce the luminosity function rather close
to the luminosity function of Hipparcos.",2005-03-18T15:12:55Z
"Faraday Rotation Measure Gradients from a Helical Magnetic Field in 3C
  273","Using high frequency (12-22 GHz) VLBA observations we confirm the existence
of a Faraday rotation measure gradient of ~ 500 rad/m^2/mas transverse to the
jet axis in the quasar 3C 273. The gradient is seen in two epochs spaced
roughly six months apart. This stable transverse rotation measure gradient is
expected if a helical magnetic field wraps around the jet. The overall order to
the magnetic field in the inner projected 40 parsecs is consistent with a
helical field. However, we find an unexpected increase in fractional
polarization along the edges of the source, contrary to expectations. This high
fractional polarization rules out internal Faraday rotation, but is not readily
explained by a helical field. After correcting for the rotation measure, the
intrinsic magnetic field direction in the jet of 3C 273 changes from parallel
to nearly perpendicular to the projected jet motion at two locations. If a
helical magnetic field causes the observed rotation measure gradient then the
synchrotron emitting electrons must be separate from the helical field region.
The presence or absence of transverse rotation measure gradients in other
sources is also discussed.",2005-05-17T20:00:07Z
"Spectroscopic Identification of a Proto-Cluster at z=2.300:
  Environmental Dependence of Galaxy Properties at High Redshift","We have discovered a highly significant over-density of galaxies at
z=2.300+/-0.015 in the course of a redshift survey designed to select
star-forming galaxies in the redshift range z=2.3+/-0.4 in the field of the
bright z=2.72 QSO HS1700+643. The structure has a redshift-space galaxy
over-density of delta_g,z ~= 7 and an estimated matter over-density in real
space of delta_m ~= 1.8, indicating that it will virialize by z~0 with a mass
scale of ~= 1.4x10^15 M_sun, that of a rich galaxy cluster. Detailed modeling
of the spectral energy distribution -- from the rest-far-UV to the rest-near-IR
-- of the 72 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies in this field for which we
have obtained K_s and Spitzer/IRAC photometry, allows for a first direct
comparison of galaxy properties as a function of large-scale environment at
high redshift. We find that galaxies in the proto-cluster environment have mean
stellar masses and inferred ages that are ~2 times larger (at z=2.30) than
identically UV-selected galaxies outside of the structure, and show that this
is consistent with simple theoretical expectations for the acceleration of
structure formation in a region that is over-dense on large scales by the
observed amount. The proto-cluster environment contains a significant number of
galaxies that already appear old, with large stellar masses (>10^11 M_sun), by
z=2.3.",2005-02-21T21:00:18Z
Slow-roll Inflation for Generalized Two-Field Lagrangians,"We study the slow-roll regime of two field inflation, in which the two fields
are also coupled through their kinetic terms. Such Lagrangians are motivated by
particle physics and by scalar-tensor theories studied in the Einstein frame.
We compute the power spectra of adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations on
large scales to first order in the slow-roll parameters. We discuss the
relevance of the extra coupling terms for the amplitude and indexes of the
power spectra. Beyond the consistency condition which involves the amplitude of
gravitational waves, additional relations may be found in particular models
based on such Lagrangians: as an example, we find an additional general
consistency condition in implicit form for Brans-Dicke theory in the Einstein
frame.",2005-05-10T16:00:35Z
Observations of cooling neutron stars,"Observations of cooling neutron stars allow to measure photospheric radii and
to constrain the equation of state of nuclear matter at high densities. In this
paper we concentrate on neutron stars, which show thermal (photospheric) X-ray
emission and have measured distances. After a short summary of the radio
pulsars falling into this category we review the observational data of the 7
radio quiet isolated neutron stars discovered by ROSAT which have been studied
in detail by Chandra, XMM-Newton and optical observations. Their spectra show
blackbody temperatures between 0.5 and 1 million Kelvin and an optical excess
of a factor of 5-10 over the extrapolation of the X-ray spectrum. Four of these
sources show periodicities between 3.45 and 11.37 s, indicating slow rotation.
The pulsed fractions are small, between 6 and 18 %. The magnetic fields derived
from spin down and/or possible proton cyclotron lines are of the order
10$^{13}-10^{14}$ G. We then discuss RX J1856.5-3754 in detail and suggest that
the remarkable absence of any line features in its X-ray spectrum is due to
effects of strong magnetic fields ($\sim 10^{13}$ G). Assuming blackbody
emission to fit the optical and X-ray spectrum we derive a conservative lower
limit of the ``apparent'' neutron star radius of 16.5 km $\times$ (d/117 pc).
This corresponds to the radius for the ``true'' radius of 14 km for a 1.4
M$_{\odot}$ neutron star, indicating a stiff equation of state at high
densities. A comparison of the result with mass-radius relations shows that in
this case a quark star or a neutron star with a quark matter core can be ruled
out with high confidence.",2005-02-22T16:37:50Z
WIMPs search by means of the highly segmented scintillator,"The highly sensitive method to search for WIMPs dark matter particles is
proposed. An array of thin NaI(Tl) plate has the great selectivity for
distinguishing the WIMPs events and background ones. The principle of signal
selection for WIMPs is described. The high sensitivity for SD (spin-dependent)
type WIMPs is expected by applying multi-layer system of NaI(Tl) detector.",2005-06-15T00:56:25Z
Cosmology and Astrophysics,"In these lectures I review the present status of the so-called Standard
Cosmological Model, based on the hot Big Bang Theory and the Inflationary

"Seismic analysis of the second ionization region of helium in the Sun:
  I. Sensitivity study and methodology","The region of the second ionization of helium in the Sun is a narrow layer
near the surface. Ionization induces a local change of the adiabatic exponent
$\Gamma_1$, which produces a characteristic signature in the frequencies of
p-modes. By adapting the method developed by (Monteiro et al. 1994), we propose
a methodology for determining the properties of this region by studying such a
signature in the frequencies of oscillation.
  Using solar data we illustrate how the signal from the helium ionization zone
can be isolated. Using solar models with different physics -- theory of
convection, equation of state and low temperature opacities -- we establish how
the characteristics of the signal depend on the different aspects contributing
to the structure in the ionization layer. We further discuss how the method can
be used to measure the solar helium abundance in the envelope and to constrain
the physics affecting this region of the Sun.
  The potential usefulness of the method we propose is shown. It may complement
other inversion methods developed to study the solar structure and to determine
the envelope helium abundance.",2005-06-13T18:41:28Z
Discovery of pulsations in the X-ray transient 4U 1901+03,"We describe observations of the 2003 outburst of the hard-spectrum X-ray
transient 4U 1901+03 with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. The outburst was
first detected in 2003 February by the All-Sky Monitor, and reached a peak
2.5-25 keV flux of 8x10^-9 ergs/cm^2/s (around 240 mCrab). The only other known
outburst occurred 32.2 yr earlier, likely the longest presently known
recurrence time for any X-ray transient. Proportional Counter Array (PCA)
observations over the 5-month duration of the 2003 outburst revealed a 2.763 s
pulsar in a 22.58 d orbit. The detection of pulsations down to a flux of
3x10^-11 ergs/cm^2/s (2.5-25 keV), along with the inferred long-term accretion
rate of 8.1x10^-11 M_sun/yr (assuming a distance of 10 kpc) suggests that the
surface magnetic field strength is below ~5x10^11 G. The corresponding
cyclotron energy is thus below 4 keV, consistent with the non-detection of
resonance features at high energies. Although we could not unambiguously
identify the optical counterpart, the lack of a bright IR candidate within the
1' RXTE error circle rules out a supergiant mass donor. The neutron star in 4U
1901+03 probably accretes from the wind of a main-sequence O-B star, like most
other high-mass binary X-ray pulsars. The almost circular orbit e=0.036
confirms the system's membership in a growing class of wide, low-eccentricity
systems in which the neutron stars may have received much smaller kicks as a
result of their natal supernova explosions.",2005-06-10T19:51:29Z
"Studying the Variation of the Fine Structure Constant Using Emission
  Line Multiplets","As an extension of the method by Bahcall et al. (2004) to investigate the
time dependence of the fine structure constant, we describe an approach based
on new observations of forbidden line multiplets from different ionic species.
We obtain optical spectra of fine structure transitions in [Ne III], [Ne V], [O
III], [OI], and [SII] multiplets from a sample of 14 Seyfert 1.5 galaxies in
the low-z range 0.035 < z < 0.281. Each source and each multiplet is
independently analyzed to ascertain possible errors. Averaging over our sample,
we obtain a conservative value alpha^2(t)/\alpha^2(0) = 1.0030+-0.0014.
However, our sample is limited in size and our fitting technique simplistic as
we primarily intend to illustrate the scope and strengths of emission line
studies of the time variation of the fine structure constant. The approach can
be further extended and generalized to a ""many-multiplet emission line method""
analogous in principle to the corresponding method using absorption lines. With
that aim, we note that the theoretical limits on emission line ratios of
selected ions are precisely known, and provide well constrained selection
criteria. We also discuss several other forbidden and allowed lines that may
constitute the basis for a more rigorous study using high-resolution
instruments on the next generation of 8 m class telescopes.",2005-04-01T14:54:05Z
"VPMS J1342+2840 - an unusual quasar from the variability and proper
  motion survey","We report the discovery of the highly peculiar, radio-loud quasar VPMS
J1342+2840 (z ~ 1.3) from the variability and proper motion survey. We present
spectroscopic, imaging and photometric observations. The unusual spectrum shows
a strong depression of the continuum over a wide wavelength range in the blue
part without the typical structures of broad absorption line (BAL) troughs. The
image of the quasar is unresolved and there is no evidence for a foreground
object on the line of sight. The broad-band spectral energy distribution is not
consistent with obvious dust reddening with the standard SMC extinction curve.
The downturn of the continuum flux of VPMS J1342+2840 at short wavelengths can
be caused by dust reddening only if the reddening curve is steeper then the SMC
curve in the ultraviolet and is very flat at longer wavelengths. Alternatively,
the dominant spectral features can be explained by low-ionization BALs forming
unusually wide, overlapping absorption troughs.",2005-02-25T09:43:33Z
Constraints on the Orbital Evolution of Triton,"We present simulations of Triton's post-capture orbit that confirm the
importance of Kozai-type oscillations in its orbital elements. In the context
of the tidal orbital evolution model, these variations require average
pericenter distances much higher than previously published, and the timescale
for the tidal orbital evolution of Triton becomes longer than the age of the
Solar System. Recently-discovered irregular satellites present a new constraint
on Triton's orbital history. Our numerical integrations of test particles
indicate a timescale for Triton's orbital evolution to be less than $10^5$ yrs
for a reasonable number of distant satellites to survive Triton's passage. This
timescale is inconsistent with the exclusively tidal evolution (time scale of
$>10^8$ yrs), but consistent with the interestion with the debris from
satellite-satellite collisions. Any major regular satellites will quickly
collide among themselves after being perturbed by Triton, and the resulting
debris disk would eventually be swept up by Triton; given that the total mass
of the Uranian satellite system is 40% of that of Triton, large scale evolution
is possible. This scenario could have followed either collisional or the
recently-discussed three-body-interaction-based capture.",2005-05-11T21:15:15Z
"Investigating ionized disc models of the variable narrow-line Seyfert 1
  PG 1404+226","We investigate the use of relativistically blurred photoionized disc models
on an XMM-Newton observation of the Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxy PG 1404+226.
The model is designed to reproduce the radiation from the inner accretion disc
around a Kerr black hole, and is more successful at fitting the spectrum than
models based on a thermal soft excess. The source varies strongly over the
course of the observation, and the disc model works over all observed flux
states. We conclude that it is a useful tool in the study of certain quasars.",2005-06-06T18:16:50Z
Supernova 1954J (Variable 12) in NGC 2403 Unmasked,"We have confirmed that the precursor star of the unusual Supernova 1954J
(also known as Variable 12) in NGC 2403 survived what appears to have been a
super-outburst, similar to the 1843 Great Eruption of eta Carinae in the
Galaxy. The apparent survivor has changed little in brightness and color over
the last eight years, and a Keck spectrum reveals characteristics broadly
similar to those of eta Car. This is further suggested by our identification of
the actual outburst-surviving star in high-resolution images obtained with the
Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope. We reveal this
``supernova impostor'' as a highly luminous (M_V^0 ~ -8.0 mag), very massive
(M_initial >~ 25 Msun) eruptive star, now surrounded by a dusty (A_V ~ 4 mag)
nebula, similar to eta Car's famous Homunculus.",2005-03-15T19:16:22Z
What is L*?: Anatomy of the Galaxy Luminosity Function,"Using the empirical relations between the central galaxy luminosity and the
halo mass, and between the total galaxy luminosity in a halo and the halo mass,
we construct the galaxy luminosity function (LF). To the luminosity of the
central galaxy in a halo of a given mass we assign log-normal scatter with a
mean calibrated against the observations. In halos where the total galaxy
luminosity exceeds that of the central galaxy, satellite galaxies are
distributed as a power-law in luminosity. Combined with the halo mass function,
this description reproduces the observed characteristics of the galaxy LF,
including a shape consistent with the Schechter function. When all galaxies are
included, regardless of the environment or the Hubble type, the Schechter L* is
the luminosity scale above which the central galaxy luminosity-halo mass
relation flattens; L* corresponds to ~10^{13}Msun on the halo mass scale. In
surveys where central galaxies in massive clusters are neglected, either by
design or because of the cosmic variance, L* is simply the mean luminosity of
central galaxies in halos at the upper end of the selected mass range. The
smooth, exponential decay of the Schechter function toward high luminosities
reflects the intrinsic scatter in the central galaxy luminosity-halo mass
relation. In addition to the LF, the model successfully reproduces the observed
dependence of galaxy clustering bias on luminosity.",2005-04-27T19:51:49Z
"HS 0943+1404, a true intermediate polar","We have identified a new intermediate polar, HS 0943+1404, as part of our
ongoing search for cataclysmic variables in the Hamburg Quasar Survey. The
orbital and white dwarf spin periods determined from time-resolved photometry
and spectroscopy are Porb ~= 250 min and Pspin = 69.171 +- 0.001 min,
respectively. The combination of a large ratio Pspin/Porb ~= 0.3 and a long
orbital period is very unusual compared to the other known intermediate polars.
The magnetic moment of the white dwarf is estimated to be mu1 ~ 10^{34} G cm^3,
which is in the typical range of polars. Our extensive photometry shows that HS
0943+1404 enters into deep (~ 3 mag) low states, which are also a
characteristic feature of polars. We therefore suggest that the system is a
true ``intermediate'' polar that will eventually synchronise, that is, a
transitional object between intermediate polars and polars. The optical
spectrum of HS 0943+1404 also exhibits a number of unusual emission lines, most
noticeably NII 5680, which is likely to reflect enhanced nitrogen abundances in
the envelope of the secondary.",2005-06-02T11:56:29Z
"The radial velocity dispersion profile of the Galactic halo:
  Constraining the density profile of the dark halo of the Milky Way","We have compiled a new sample of 240 halo objects with accurate distance and
radial velocity measurements, including globular clusters, satellite galaxies,
field blue horizontal branch stars and red giant stars from the Spaghetti
survey. The new data lead to a significant increase in the number of known
objects for Galactocentric radii beyond 50 kpc, which allows a reliable
determination of the radial velocity dispersion profile out to very large
distances. The radial velocity dispersion shows an almost constant value of 120
km/s out to 30 kpc and then continuously declines down to 50 km/s at about 120
kpc. This fall-off puts important constraints on the density profile and total
mass of the dark matter halo of the Milky Way. For a constant velocity
anisotropy, the isothermal profile is ruled out, while both a dark halo
following a truncated flat model of mass $1.2^{+1.8}_{-0.5}\times 10^{12}$
M_sun and an NFW profile of mass $0.8^{+1.2}_{-0.2}\times 10^{12}$ M_sun and
c=18 are consistent with the data. The significant increase in the number of
tracers combined with the large extent of the region probed by these has
allowed a more precise determination of the Milky Way mass in comparison to
previous works. We also show how different assumptions for the velocity
anisotropy affect the performance of the mass models.",2005-06-05T17:49:50Z
"Discovery of a Galaxy Cluster in the Foreground of the Wide-Separation
  Quasar Pair UM425","We report the discovery of a cluster of galaxies in the field of UM425, a
pair of quasars separated by 6.5arcsec. Based on this finding, we revisit the
long-standing question of whether this quasar pair is a binary quasar or a
wide-separation lens. Previous work has shown that both quasars are at z=1.465
and show broad absorption lines. No evidence for a lensing galaxy has been
found between the quasars, but there were two hints of a foreground cluster:
diffuse X-ray emission observed with Chandra, and an excess of faint galaxies
observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Here we show, via VLT spectroscopy,
that there is a spike in the redshift histogram of galaxies at z=0.77. We
estimate the chance of finding a random velocity structure of such significance
to be about 5%, and thereby interpret the diffuse X-ray emission as originating
from z=0.77, rather than the quasar redshift. The mass of the cluster, as
estimated from either the velocity dispersion of the z=0.77 galaxies or the
X-ray luminosity of the diffuse emission, would be consistent with the
theoretical mass required for gravitational lensing. The positional offset
between the X-ray centroid and the expected location of the mass centroid is
about 40kpc, which is not too different from offsets observed in lower redshift
clusters. However, UM425 would be an unusual gravitational lens, by virtue of
the absence of a bright primary lensing galaxy. Unless the mass-to-light ratio
of the galaxy is at least 80 times larger than usual, the lensing hypothesis
requires that the galaxy group or cluster plays a uniquely important role in
producing the observed deflections.

Southern Observatory, Paranal, Chile.",2005-05-12T10:35:16Z
"Overview of the ISM Phases: Evolution of Large and Small Scale
  Structures in 3D high resolution HD and MHD simulations","We review recent 3D high resolution numerical HD and MHD studies of a
multi-component and multi-phase ISM. The computational grid was chosen large
enough in the disk to represent typical ISM gas patterns, and in the halo to
include the full extent of the Galactic fountain. The evolution of the ISM is
driven by supernovae of all types and followed for 400 Myrs, long enough to get
rid of memory effects of the initial distributions. The results are
substantially different from previous classical analytical models and entail:
(i) a very inhomogeneous distribution of ISM gas, (ii) a high level of
supernova driven turbulence, (iii) an active Galactic fountain flow, reaching
out to about 5 kpc on either side of the disk, (iv) a low volume filling factor
for the hot gas of about 20%, (v) a very weak correlation between magnetic
field and gas density, n, for n < 100 cm^-3, and, (vi) about 50% of the gas
disk mass with n < 100 cm^-3, residing in classically thermally unstable
temperature regimes.",2005-04-11T16:09:37Z
"XMM-Newton EPIC and OM Observations of Her X-1 over the 35 d Beat Period
  and an Anomalous Low State","We present the results of a series of XMM-Newton EPIC and OM observations of
Her X-1, spread over a wide range of the 35 d precession period. We confirm
that the spin modulation of the neutron star is weak or absent in the low state
- in marked contrast to the main or short-on states. The strong fluorescence
emission line at ~6.4 keV is detected in all observations (apart from one taken
in the middle of eclipse), with higher line energy, width and normalisation
during the main-on state. In addition, we report the detection of a second line
near 7 keV in 10 of the 15 observations taken during the low-intensity states
of the system. We discuss these observations in the context of previous
observations, investigate the origin of the soft and hard X-rays and consider
the emission site of the 6.4keV and 7keV emission lines.",2005-03-10T12:34:00Z
On the shape of the UHE cosmic ray spectrum,"We fit the ultra high energy cosmic ray spectra above 10$^{19}$ eV with
different injection spectra at cosmic ray sources that are uniformly and
homogeneously distributed in the Universe. We conclude that the current UHE
spectra are consistent with power laws of index $\alpha$ between 2.4 and 2.7.
There is a slow dependence of these indices on the cosmological evolution of
the cosmic ray sources, which in this model determines the end of the galactic
cosmic rays spectrum.",2005-06-14T19:40:20Z
Are violent events responsible of a Galaxy Morphological loop?,"We use cosmological SPH simulations to investigate the effects of mergers and
interactions on the formation of the bulge and disc components of galactic
systems. We find that secular evolution during mergers seems to be a key
process in the formation of stable disc-bulge systems with observational
counterparts and contributes to establish the fundamental relations observed in
galaxies. Our findings suggest that the secular evolution phase couples the
formation mechanisms of the bulge and disc components. According to our
results, depending on the particular stability properties and merger
parameters, violents events could drive a morphological loop in which the
outcome could be a disc or a spheroid.",2005-03-31T15:20:50Z
"The Structure and Star Formation History of Early-Type Galaxies in the
  UDF/GRAPES Survey","We present a two-pronged approach to the formation of early-type galaxies,
using a sample of 18 galaxies at 0.5 < z < 1 from the HST/ACS Ultra Deep Field
and GRAPES surveys: 1) We combine slitless low resolution spectroscopy from the
GRAPES dataset with simple models of galaxy formation to explore their star
formation histories. 2) We also perform an analysis of their surface brightness
distribution with the unprecedented details provided by the ACS superb angular
resolution and photometric depth. Our spectroscopic analysis reveals that their
stellar populations are rather homogeneous in age and metallicity and formed at
redshifts z ~ 2-5. Evolving them passively, they become practically
indistinguishable from ellipticals at z = 0. Also, their isophotal shapes
appear very similar to those observed for nearby ellipticals, in that the
percentages of disky and boxy galaxies at z ~ 1 are close to the values
measured at z = 0. Moreover,we find that the isophotal structure of z ~ 1
early-type galaxies obeys the correlations already observed among nearby
ellipticals, i.e. disky ellipticals have generally higher characteristic
ellipticities, and boxy ellipticals have larger half-light radii and are
brighter in the restframe B band. In this respect then, no significant
structural differences are seen for ellipticals between z = 0 and 1.",2005-04-12T08:52:02Z
"PROMPT: Panchromatic Robotic Optical Monitoring and Polarimetry
  Telescopes","Funded by $1.2M in grants and donations, we are now building PROMPT at CTIO.
When completed in late 2005, PROMPT will consist of six 0.41-meter diameter
Ritchey-Chretien telescopes on rapidly slewing mounts that respond to GRB
alerts within seconds, when the afterglow is potentially extremely bright. Each
mirror and camera coating is being optimized for a different wavelength range
and function, including a NIR imager, two red-optimized imagers, a
blue-optimized imager, an UV-optimized imager, and an optical polarimeter.
PROMPT will be able to identify high-redshift events by dropout and distinguish
these events from the similar signatures of extinction. In this way, PROMPT
will act as a distance-finder scope for spectroscopic follow up on the larger
4.1-meter diameter SOAR telescope, which is also located at CTIO. When not
chasing GRBs, PROMPT serves broader educational objectives across the state of
North Carolina. Enclosure construction and the first two telescopes are now
complete and functioning: PROMPT observed Swift's first GRB in December 2004.
We upgrade from two to four telescope in February 2005 and from four to six
telescopes in mid-2005.",2005-02-21T19:36:51Z
The Fan Observatory Bench Optical Spectrograph (FOBOS),"The Fan Observatory Bench Optical Spectrograph (FOBOS) is intended for
single-object optical spectroscopy at moderate resolution (R~1500-3000) using a
fiber-fed, bench-mounted design to maintain stability. Whenever possible, the
instrument uses off-the-shelf components to maintain a modest cost. FOBOS
supports Galactic astronomy projects that require consistently well-measured
(~5 km/sec) radial velocities for large numbers of broadly distributed and
relatively bright (V<14) stars. The spectrograph provides wavelength coverage
throughout the optical spectrum, although the instrument design was optimized
for use in the range 470-670 nm. Test data indicate that the instrument is
stable and capable of measuring radial velocities with precision better than 3
km/sec at a resolution of R~1500 with minimal calibration overhead.",2005-02-23T20:00:14Z
Efficient Monte Carlo methods for continuum radiative transfer,"We discuss the efficiency of Monte Carlo methods in solving continuum
radiative transfer problems. The sampling of the radiation field and
convergence of dust temperature calculations in the case of optically thick
clouds are both studied. For spherically symmetric clouds we find that the
computational cost of Monte Carlo simulations can be reduced, in some cases by
orders of magnitude, with simple importance weighting schemes. This is
particularly true for models consisting of cells of different sizes for which
the run times would otherwise be determined by the size of the smallest cell.
We present a new idea of extending importance weighting to scattered photons.
This is found to be useful in calculations of scattered flux and could be
important for three-dimensional models when observed intensity is needed only
for one general direction of observations. Convergence of dust temperature
calculations is studied for models with optical depths 10-10000. We examine
acceleration methods where radiative interactions inside a cell or between
neighbouring cells are treated explicitly. In optically thick clouds with
strong self-coupling between dust temperatures the run times can be reduced by
more than one order of magnitude. The use of a reference field was also
examined. This eliminates the need for repeating simulation of constant sources
(e.g., background radiation) after the first iteration and significantly
reduces sampling errors. The applicability of the methods for three-dimensional
models is discussed.",2005-04-06T10:27:27Z
"XMM-Newton Observations of Evolution of Cluster X-Ray Scaling Relations
  at z=0.4-0.7","We present a spatially-resolved analysis of the temperature and gas density
profiles of galaxy clusters at z=0.4-0.7 observed with XMM-Newton. These data
are used to derive the total cluster mass within the radius r_500 without
assuming isothermality, and also to measure the average temperature and total
X-ray luminosity excluding the cooling cores. We derive the high-redshift M-T
and L-T relations and compare them with the local measurements. The
high-redshift L-T relation has low scatter and evolves as L ~ (1+z)^{1.8\pm0.3}
for a fixed T, in good agreement with several previous Chandra and XMM-Newton
studies (Vikhlinin et al., Lumb et al., Maughan et al.). The observed evolution
of the M-T relation follows M_500 = A T^{3/2} E(z)^{-alpha}, where we measure
alpha=0.88\pm0.23. This is in good agreement with predictions of the
self-similar theory, alpha=1.",2005-04-11T19:36:52Z
Photoionized Lines in the X-ray Spectra of SMC X-1,"We present a detailed spectral analysis of Chandra/ACIS-S CC mode
observations of the massive X-ray binary system SMC X-1. The system was
observed during both the high and low X-ray states of the roughly 60-day
superorbital period. The continuum spectra during both states are well
represented by a power law with photon index $\alpha$=0.9 and a blackbody of kT
= 0.15keV. The high state spectra are dominated by the continuum and
independent of orbital phase whereas the low state spectra show a strong
orbital dependence as well as line emission from O, Ne, Mg, Fe, and Si. This is
consistent with the states attributed to disk precession: during the high state
X-ray emission is dominated by the compact source which is abrubtly eclipsed
and during the low state the compact object is hidden by the disk and a larger,
less luminous scattering region is responsible for the X-ray emission. A
prominent Ne IX feature places a stringent limit (Log $\xi$ = 2.0-2.5) on the
ionization parameter which constrains the wind dynamics of the system. The Fe
line fluxes are related linearly to the blackbody fluxes indicating that both
originate in the same region or are excited by the same mechanism. There is
evidence for structure in the Fe-line that cannot be fully resolved by the
current observations. The pulse period measured during our observations,
0.7057147$\pm$0.00000027s shows that the uninterrupted spin-up trend of SMC X-1
continues. We discuss the implications of our results for models of SMC X-1.",2005-02-14T14:32:35Z
The Molecular Accretion Flow in G10.6-0.4,"We have observed the ultracompact HII region G10.6-0.4 with the VLA in 23 GHz
continuum and the NH3(3,3) inversion line. By analyzing the optical depth of
the line as well as the kinematics, we have detected a flattened, rotating,
molecular accretion flow. We detect the fact that the highest column density
gas is more flattened, that is, distributed more narrowly, than the lower
column density gas, and that there is some inclination of the rotation axis.
The rotation is sub-Keplerian, and the molecular gas is not in a rotationally
supported disk. We do not find a single massive (proto)star forming in a scaled
up version of low mass star formation. Instead, our observations suggest a
different mode of clustered massive star formation, in which the accretion flow
flattens but does not form an accretion disk. Also in this mode of star
formation the central object can be a group of massive stars rather than a
single massive star.",2005-06-02T13:30:40Z
A Statistical Solar Flare Forecast Method,"A Bayesian approach to solar flare prediction has been developed, which uses
only the event statistics of flares already observed. The method is simple,
objective, and makes few ad hoc assumptions. It is argued that this approach
should be used to provide a baseline prediction for certain space weather
purposes, upon which other methods, incorporating additional information, can
improve. A practical implementation of the method for whole-Sun prediction of
Geostationary Observational Environment Satellite (GOES) events is described in
detail, and is demonstrated for 4 November 2003, the day of the largest
recorded GOES flare. A test of the method is described based on the historical
record of GOES events (1975-2003), and a detailed comparison is made with US
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predictions for
1987-2003. Although the NOAA forecasts incorporate a variety of other
information, the present method out-performs the NOAA method in predicting mean
numbers of event days, for both M-X and X events. Skill scores and other
measures show that the present method is slightly less accurate at predicting
M-X events than the NOAA method, but substantially more accurate at predicting
X events, which are important contributors to space weather.",2005-05-14T23:32:57Z
Multi-Phase Galaxy Formation and Quasar Absorption Systems,"The central problem of galaxy formation is understanding the cooling and
condensation of gas in dark matter halos. It is now clear that to match
observations this requires further physics than the simple assumptions of
single phase gas cooling. A model of multi-phase cooling (Maller & Bullock
2004) can successfully account for the upper cutoff in the masses of galaxies
and provides a natural explanation of many types of absorption systems (Mo &
Miralda-Escude 1996).
  Absorption systems are our best probes of the gaseous content of galaxy halos
and therefore provide important constraints on models for gas cooling into
galaxies. All physical processes that effect gas cooling redistribute gas and
therefore are detectable in absorption systems. Detailed studies of the nature
of gas in galaxy halos using absorption systems are crucial for building a
correct theory of galaxy formation.",2005-05-06T17:29:51Z
"Search for Extra-Terrestrial planets: The DARWIN mission - Target Stars
  and Array Architectures","The DARWIN mission is an Infrared free flying interferometer mission based on
the new technique of nulling interferometry. Its main objective is to detect
and characterize other Earth-like planets, analyze the composition of their
atmospheres and their capability to sustain life, as we know it. DARWIN is
currently in definition phase. This PhD work that has been undertaken within
the DARWIN team at the European Space Agency (ESA) addresses two crucial
aspects of the mission. Firstly, a DARWIN target star list has been established
that includes characteristics of the target star sample that will be critical
for final mission design, such as, luminosity, distance, spectral
classification, stellar variability, multiplicity, location and radius of the
star. Constrains were applied as set by planet evolution theory and mission
architecture. Secondly, a number of alternative mission architectures have been
evaluated on the basis of interferometer response as a function of wavelength,
achievable modulation efficiency, number of telescopes and starlight rejection
capabilities. The study has shown that the core mission goals should be
achievable with a lower level of complexity as compared to the current baseline
configuration.",2005-04-22T12:39:07Z
"The environmental dependence of galaxy colors in intermediate redshift
  X-ray-selected clusters","We present a wide-field imaging study of the colors of bright galaxies in 12
X-ray selected clusters and groups of galaxies at z ~ 0.3. The systems cover
one of the largest ranges in X-ray luminosity (Lx ~ 10^43 - 10^45 erg/s), and
hence mass, of any sample studied at this redshift. We find that the `red'
galaxies form a tight color-magnitude relation (CMR) and that neither the slope
nor zero-point of this relation changes significantly over the factor of 100 in
X-ray luminosity of our sample. Using stellar population synthesis models we
find our data allow a maximum possible change of 2 Gyrs in the typical age of
the galaxies on the CMR over the range of Lx of our sample. We also measure the
fraction of blue galaxies (fb) relative to the CMR in our clusters and find a
low value of fb ~ 0.1 and find that there is no correlation between fb and Lx
over our large Lx range. However, both the CMR and fb do depend on cluster
radius, with the zero-point of the CMR shifting blueward in B-R by 0.10 +/-
0.036 magnitudes out to 0.75 times the virial radius, equivalent to a
luminosity weighted age gradient of ~ 2.5 Gyrs per log(radius). It thus appears
that the global cluster environment, in the form of cluster mass (Lx), has
little influence on the properties of bright cluster galaxies, whereas the
local environment, in the form of galaxy density (radius), has a strong effect.
The range of ~ 100 in Lx corresponds to a factor of ~ 40 in ram-pressure
efficiency, suggesting that ram-pressure stripping, or other mechanisms that
depend on cluster mass like tidal stripping or harassment, are unlikely to be
solely responsible for changing the galaxy population from the `blue' star
forming galaxies, that dominate low density environments, to the `red' passive
galaxies that dominate cluster cores.(abridged)",2005-03-22T17:19:54Z
"The HARPS search for southern extra-solar planets. III. Three
  Saturn-mass planets around HD 93083, HD 101930 and HD 102117","We report on the detection of three Saturn-mass planets discovered with the
HARPS instrument. HD 93083 shows radial-velocity (RV) variations best explained
by the presence of a companion of 0.37 M_Jup orbiting in 143.6 days. HD 101930
b has an orbital period of 70.5 days and a minimum mass of 0.30 M_Jup. For HD
102117, we present the independent detection of a companion with m2sini = 0.14
M_Jup and orbital period P = 20.7 days. This planet was recently detected by
Tinney et al. (2004). Activity and bisector indicators exclude any significant
RV perturbations of stellar origin, reinforcing the planetary interpretation of
the RV variations. The radial-velocity residuals around the Keplerian fits are
2.0, 1.8 and 0.9 m/s respectively, showing the unprecedented RV accuracy
achieved with HARPS. A sample of stable stars observed with HARPS is also
presented to illustrate the long-term precision of the instrument. All three
stars are metal-rich, confirming the now well-established relation between
planet occurrence and metallicity. The new planets are all in the Saturn-mass
range, orbiting at moderate distance from their parent star, thereby occupying
an area of the parameter space which seems difficult to populate according to
planet formation theories. A systematic exploration of these regions will
provide new constraints on formation scenarios in the near future.",2005-03-30T14:21:38Z
"On the Identification of High Mass Star Forming Regions using IRAS:
  Contamination by Low-Mass Protostars","We present the results of a survey of a small sample (14) of low-mass
protostars (L_IR < 10^3 Lsun) for 6.7 GHz methanol maser emission performed
using the ATNF Parkes radio telescope. No new masers were discovered. We find
that the lower luminosity limit for maser emission is near 10^3 Lsun, by
comparison of the sources in our sample with previously detected methanol maser
sources. We examine the IRAS properties of our sample and compare them with
sources previously observed for methanol maser emission, almost all of which
satisfy the Wood & Churchwell criterion for selecting candidate UCHII regions.
We find that about half of our sample satisfy this criterion, and in addition
almost all of this subgroup have integrated fluxes between 25 and 60 microns
that are similar to sources with detectable methanol maser emission. By
identifying a number of low-mass protostars in this work and from the
literature that satisfy the Wood & Churchwell criterion for candidate UCHII
regions, we show conclusively for the first time that the fainter flux end of
their sample is contaminated by lower-mass non-ionizing sources, confirming the
suggestion by van der Walt and Ramesh & Sridharan.",2005-04-22T13:46:39Z
"The first giant flare from SGR 1806-20: observations with the INTEGRAL
  SPI Anti-Coincidence Shield","A giant flare from the Soft Gamma-ray Repeater SGR 1806-20 has been detected
by several satellites on 2004 December 27. This tremendous outburst, the first
one observed from this source, was a hundred times more powerful than the two
previous giant flares from SGR 0525-66 and SGR 1900+14. We report the results
obtained for this event with the Anticoincidence Shield of the SPI spectrometer
on board the INTEGRAL satellite, which provides a high-statistics light curve
at E>~80 keV. The flare started with a very strong pulse, which saturated the
detector for ~0.7 s, and whose backscattered radiation from the Moon was
detected 2.8 s later. This was followed by a ~400 s long tail modulated at the
neutron star rotation period of 7.56 s. The tail fluence corresponds to an
energy in photons above 3 keV of 1.6x10^44 (d/15 kpc)^2 erg. This is of the
same order of the energy emitted in the pulsating tails of the two giant flares
seen from other soft repeaters, despite the hundredfold larger overall emitted
energy of the SGR 1806-20 giant flare. Long lasting (~1 hour) hard X-ray
emission, decaying in time as t^-0.85, and likely associated to the SGR 1806-20
giant flare afterglow has also been detected.",2005-02-28T15:58:34Z
A simple model for the evolution of disc galaxies: The Milky Way,"A simple model for the evolution of disc galaxies is presented. We adopt
three numbers from observations of the Milky Way disc, the local surface mass
density, the stellar scale length (of the assumedly exponential disc) and the
amplitude of the (assumedly flat) rotation curve, and physically, the (local)
dynamical Kennicutt star formation prescription, standard chemical evolution
equations assuming and a model for spectral evolution of stellar populations.
We can determine the detailed evolution of the model with only the addition of
standard cosmological scalings with time of the dimensional parameters. A
surprising wealth of detailed specifications follows from this prescription
including the gaseous infall rate as a function of radius and time, the
distribution of stellar ages and metallicities with time and radius, surface
brightness profiles at different wavelengths, colours etc. At the solar
neighbourhood stars start to form $\approx 10 Gyrs$ ago at an increasing rate
peaking 4 billion years ago and then slowly declining in good agreement with
observations. The mean age of long lived stars at the solar neighbourhood is
about $4 Gyrs$. The local surface density of the stars and gas are 35 and $15
M_{\odot}pc^{-2}$, respectively. The metallicity distribution of the stars at
the solar radius is narrow with a peak at $[Z/Z_{\odot}] = -0.1$.Both a
Salpeter IMF and a Chabrier IMF are consistent with observations. Comparisons
with the current and local fossil evidence provides support for the model which
can then be used to assess other local disc galaxies, the evolution of disc
galaxies in deep optical surveys and also for theoretical investigations such
as simulations of merging disc galaxies (abbreviated).",2005-05-30T10:26:12Z
A Chandra and XMM-Newton study of the wide-angle tail radio galaxy 3C465,"We have observed the prototypical wide-angle tail radio galaxy 3C465 with
Chandra and XMM-Newton. X-ray emission is detected from the active nucleus and
the inner radio jet, as well as a small-scale, cool component of thermal
emission, a number of the individual galaxies of the host cluster (Abell 2634),
and the hotter thermal emission from the cluster itself. The X-ray detection of
the jet allows us to argue that synchrotron emission may be an important
mechanism in other well-collimated, fast jets, including those of classical
double radio sources. The bases of the radio plumes are not detected in the
X-ray, which supports the model in which these plumes are physically different
from the twin jets of lower-power radio galaxies. The plumes are in fact
spatially coincident with deficits of X-ray emission on large scales, which
argues that they contain little thermal material at the cluster temperature,
although the minimum pressures throughout the source are lower than the
external pressures estimated from the observed thermal emission. Our
observations confirm both spatially and spectrally that a component of dense,
cool gas with a short cooling time is associated with the central galaxy.
However, there is no evidence for the kind of discontinuity in external
properties that would be required in many models of the jet-plume transition in
WATs. Although the WAT jet-plume transition appears likely to be related to the
interface between this central cool component and the hotter intra-cluster
medium, the mechanism for WAT formation remains unclear. We revisit the
question of the bending of WAT plumes, and show that the plumes can be bent by
plausible bulk motions of the intra-cluster medium, or by motion of the host
galaxy with respect to the cluster, as long as the plumes are light.",2005-02-28T15:29:55Z
"The Dog on the Ship: The ""Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy"" as an Outlying Part
  of the Argo Star System","Overdensities in the distribution of low latitude, 2MASS giant stars are
revealed by systematically peeling away from sky maps the bulk of the giant
stars conforming to ``isotropic'' density laws generally accounting for known
Milky Way components. This procedure, combined with a higher resolution
treatment of the sky density of both giants and dust allows us to probe to
lower Galactic latitudes than previous 2MASS giant star studies. While the
results show the swath of excess giants previously associated with the
Monoceros ring system in the second and third Galactic quadrants at distances
of 6-20 kpc, we also find a several times larger overdensity of giants in the
same distance range concentrated in the direction of the ancient constellation
Argo. Isodensity contours of the large structure suggest that it is highly
elongated and inclined by about 3 deg to the disk, although details of the
structure -- including the actual location of highest density, overall extent,
true shape -- and its origin, remain unknown because only a fraction of it lies
outside highly dust-obscured, low latitude regions. Nevertheless, our results
suggest that the 2MASS M giant overdensity previously claimed to represent the
core of a dwarf galaxy in Canis Major (l ~ 240 deg) is an artifact of a dust
extinction window opening to the overall density rise to the more significant
Argo structure centered at larger longitude (l ~ 290 +- 10 deg, b ~ -4 +- 2
deg).",2005-04-05T18:33:58Z
"Rotational Widths for Use in the Tully-Fisher Relation. I. Long-slit
  Spectroscopic Data","We present new long-slit Halpha spectroscopy for 403 non-interacting spiral
galaxies, obtained at the Palomar Observatory 5 m Hale telescope, which is used
to derive well-sampled optical rotation curves. Because many of the galaxies
show optical emission features which are significantly extended along the
spectrograph slit, a technique was devised to separate and subtract the night
sky lines from the galaxy emission. We exploit a functional fit to the rotation
curve to identify its center of symmetry; this method minimizes the asymmetry
in the final, folded rotation curve. We derive rotational widths using both
velocity histograms and the Polyex model fit. The final rotational width is
measured at a radius containing 83% of the total light as derived from I-band
images. In addition to presenting the new data, we use a large sample of 742
galaxies for which both optical long-slit and radio HI line spectroscopy are
available to investigate the relation between the HI content of the disks and
the extent of their rotation curves. Our results show that the correlation
between those quantities, which is well-established in the case of HI-poor
galaxies in clusters, is present also in HI-normal objects: for a given optical
size, star formation can be traced further out in the disks of galaxies with
larger HI mass.",2005-06-07T18:02:45Z
The analysis of magnetic field measurements of T Tau,"It is shown that the existence of hot accretion spots at the surface of T Tau
practically has no effect on the accuracy of estimation of its magnetic field
strength at photospheric level.
  We also found that one can interpret results of T Tau's photospheric magnetic
field strength measurements carried out via different methods in the frame of
the following alternative: 1) if T Tau's inclination angle $i\le 10^\circ,$
then magnetic field of the star may be dipolar with the angle between
rotational and magnetic axes is near $85^\circ;$ 2) if it will be found (e.g.
from interferometric observations) that $i>10^\circ,$ then magnetic field of T
Tau is essentially non-dipolar or/and non-stationary.",2005-02-17T15:33:57Z
"The Effect of Gravity Between Particles on the Shape and Resonant
  Structure of Planetary Rings","The resonance perturbation of planetary ring by distant satellite is
considered. The gravity interaction between rings particles is taken into
account. The gravitation interaction between particles in rings can change
shape of non-circular rings, so it is differ from keplerian ellipse. The shift
between simple mean motion resonances and parametric resonance zones is
detected. This shift depends on ring properties.",2005-05-18T07:14:10Z
Evolution of V838 Monocerotis during and after the 2002 eruption,"By fitting the available photometric data on V838 Mon with standard
supergiant spectra we have derived principal stellar parameters, i.e. effective
temperature, radius and luminosity, and followed the evolution of the object
since its discovery in early January 2002. Our analysis shows that the 2002
outburst of V838 Mon consisted of two major phases: pre-eruption which was
observed in January 2002 and a major outburst, called eruption, which started
in the beginning of February 2002. During pre-eruption the object seemed to be
relaxing after an initial event which had presumably taken place in last days
of December 2001. The eruption phase, which lasted till mid-April 2002,
resulted from a very strong energy burst, which presumably took place in last
days of January at the base of the stellar envelope inflated in pre-eruption.
The burst produced an energy wave, which was observed as a strong luminosity
flash in the beginning of February, followed by a strong mass outflow in form
of two shells, which was observed as an expanding photosphere in later epochs.
In mid-April, when the outflow became optically transparent and most of its
energy radiated away, the object entered the decline phase during which V838
Mon was evolving along the Hayashi track. This we interpret as an evidence that
the main energy source during decline was due to gravitational contraction of
the object envelope inflated in eruption. Late in 2002 a dust formation started
in the expanding shells which gave rise to a strong infrared excess observed in
2003.",2005-02-03T08:43:29Z
TeV neutrinos from microquasars in compact massive binaries,"We consider a compact binary system in which a Wolf-Rayet star supplies
matter onto a stellar mass black hole or a neutron star. This matter forms an
accretion disk which ejects a jet as observed in Galactic microquasars. A part
of the jet kinetic energy, typically 10%, can be transfered to relativistic
nuclei. These nuclei lose nucleons as a result of photo-disintegration process
in collisions with thermal photons from the accretion disk and the massive
star. Due to the head on photon-nucleus collisions most of neutrons released
from nuclei move towards the surface of the accretion disk and/or the massive
star producing neutrinos in collisions with the matter. We calculate the
spectra of muon neutrinos and expected neutrino event rates in a 1 km^2
neutrino detector of the IceCube type from a microquasar inside our Galaxy
applying, as an example, the parameters of the Cyg X-3 binary system, provided
that nuclei are accelerated to the Lorentz factors above 10^6 with the power
law spectrum with an index close to 2.",2005-05-27T07:37:52Z
Surface Modes on Bursting Neutron Stars and X-ray Burst Oscillations,"Accreting neutron stars (NSs) often show coherent modulations during type I
X-ray bursts, called burst oscillations. We consider whether a nonradial mode
can serve as an explanation for burst oscillations from those NSs which are not
magnetic. We find that a surface wave in the shallow burning layer transitions
into a crustal interface wave as the envelope cools, a new and previously
uninvestigated phenomenon. The surface modulations decrease dramatically as the
mode switches, explaining why burst oscillations often disappear before burst
cooling ceases. When we include rotational modifications, we find mode
frequencies and drifts consistent with those observed. The large NS spin
($\approx270-620 {\rm Hz}$) needed to make this match implies that accreting
NSs are spinning at frequencies $\approx4 {\rm Hz}$ above the burst
oscillation. Since the asymptotic frequency is set by the crustal interface
wave, the observed late time frequency drifts are a probe of the composition
and temperature of NS crusts. We compare our model with the observed drifts and
persistent luminosities of X-ray burst sources, and find that NSs with a higher
average accretion rate show smaller drifts, as we predict. Furthermore, the
drift sizes are consistent with crusts composed of iron-like nuclei, as
expected for the ashes of the He-rich bursts that are exhibited by these
objects.",2005-02-25T17:51:49Z
Preservation of Cuspy Profiles in Disk Galaxy Mergers,"We carried out three self-consistent $N$-body simulations of galaxy mergers,
with a cuspy dark matter profile, in order to study if the inner dark density
slope is preserved in the remnants. In these simulations the progenitors
include both a stellar disk and an intrinsic angular momentum for the halos,
unlike previous similar studies. The mass-ratios of progenitor galaxies are
about 1:1, 1:3 and 1:10. We find that the initial cuspy density profile of the
dark halos is preserved in the remnants for the cases considered here.",2005-06-13T20:37:15Z
"Gravitational Wave Astrometry for Rapidly Rotating Neutron Stars and
  Estimation of Their Distances","We discuss an astrometric timing effect on data analysis of continuous
gravitational waves from rapidly rotating isolated neutron stars. Special
attention is directed to the possibility of determining their distances by
measuring the curvature of the wave fronts. We predict that if continuous
gravitational waves from an unknown neutron star with a stable rotation are
detected around 1kHz within 1/3yr by initial LIGO detectors and the ellipticity
parameter epsilon is smaller than 10^{-6}, the distance r to the source can be
estimated with relative error \Delta r/r of \sim 10% by using the broad band
configuration of advanced LIGO detectors over 3 years. By combining the
observed amplitude of the waves with the estimated distance, information on the
parameter $\epsilon$ can be obtained purely through gravitational wave
measurements.",2005-05-26T22:18:42Z
The high-velocity clouds and the Magellanic Clouds,"From an analysis of the sky and velocity distributions of the high-velocity
clouds (HVCs) we show that the majority of the HVCs has a common origin. We
conclude that the HVCs surround the Galaxy, forming a metacloud of 300 kpc in
size and with a mass of 3 10^9 M_sun, and that they are the product of a
powerful ``superwind'' (about 10^58 ergs), which occurred in the Magellanic
Clouds about 570 Myr ago as a consequence of the interaction of the Large and
Small Magellanic Clouds. The HVCs might be magnetic bubbles of semi-ionized
gas, blown from the Magellanic Clouds around 570 Myr ago, that circulate
largely through the halo of the Galaxy as a stream or flow of gas.",2005-05-31T23:01:16Z
"The Shocking Properties of Supersonic Flows: Dependence of the Thermal
  Overstability on M, alpha, and T_c/T_0","We investigate the Mach number dependence of the radiative overstability of
shocks. We find that the stability of radiative shocks increases with
decreasing Mach number, with the result that M=2 shocks require cooling
exponents < -1.2 to be overstable. The frequency of oscillation of the
fundamental mode has a strong Mach number dependence. We find that feedback
between the cooling region and the cold dense layer (CDL) further downstream is
a function of Mach number, with stronger feedback and oscillation of the
boundary between the CDL and the cooling region occuring at lower Mach numbers.
This feedback can be quantified in terms of the reflection coefficient of sound
waves. An interesting finding is that the stability properties of low Mach
number shocks can be dramatically altered if the shocked gas is able to cool to
temperatures less than the pre-shock value, and it is probable that low Mach
number astrophysical shocks will be overstable in a variety of situations. The
results of this work are relevant to astrophysical shocks with low Mach
numbers, such as supernova remnants (SNRs) immersed in a hot interstellar
medium (e.g., within a starburst region), and shocks in molecular clouds, where
time-dependent chemistry can lead to overstability. (Abridged)",2005-04-28T16:34:15Z
"MOJAVE: Monitoring of Jets in AGN with VLBA Experiments - I. First-Epoch
  15 GHz Linear Polarization Images","We present first-epoch, milliarcsecond-scale linear polarization images at 15
GHz of 133 jets associated with AGN in the MOJAVE survey (Monitoring of Jets in
Active Galactic Nuclei with VLBA Experiments). The sample consists of all known
AGN with galactic latitude |b| > 2.5 deg., J2000 declination > -20 deg., and 15
GHz VLBA flux density exceeding 1.5 Jy (2 Jy for sources with declination < 0)
at any epoch during the period 1994-2003. Because of strong selection effects,
the sample primarily consists of blazars with parsec-scale morphologies
consisting of a bright core component at the extreme end of a one-sided jet. At
least one third of the compact cores are completely unresolved on the longest
VLBA baselines, indicating brightness temperatures above 10^{11} K. The
unresolved cores tend to have electric vectors that are aligned with the inner
jet direction, suggesting the presence of a stationary transverse shock near
the base of the jet. Many of the extended jet regions display exceedingly high
fractional polarizations (> 50%) and electric vectors aligned with the jet
ridge line, consistent with optically thin emission from transverse shocks.
Both weak- and strong-lined blazars show a general increase in fractional
polarization with distance down the jet, but BL Lac jets are generally more
polarized and have electric vectors preferentially aligned with the local jet
direction. We show that these differences are intrinsic to the jets, and not
due to sample bias. Distinct features in the jets of gamma-ray loud (EGRET)
blazars are typically twice as luminous as those in non-EGRET blazars, and are
more polarized. These differences can be adequately explained if EGRET blazars
have slightly higher Doppler boosting factors than those not yet detected in
gamma-rays.",2005-03-07T16:04:05Z
"The Discovery of the Optical and Near-IR Afterglows of the First Swift
  Gamma-Ray Bursts","We present optical and near-infrared searches for afterglow emission from the
first four Swift bursts with accurate positions from the X-ray Telescope (XRT).
Using telescopes at Las Campanas, Keck, and Palomar observatories we rapidly
identified and followed up afterglows for three of the four bursts. The burst
positions were also observed with the Very Large Array, but no radio afterglow
emission was detected. The optical/NIR afterglows are fainter than about 75% of
all afterglows detected to date, with GRB 050126 being the faintest, and were
identified thanks to accurate and rapid positions from the XRT and rapid
response with >1-m telescopes. This suggests that the fraction of dust-obscured
bursts is small, <10% when combined with afterglows localized by the HETE-2
Soft X-ray Camera. The X-ray fluxes are typical of the known population, with
the exception of GRB 050126 which has the faintest X-ray afterglow to date
(normalized to t=10 hr), and was detected thanks to a response time of only 130
s after the burst. Finally, we find that all three optical/NIR afterglows are
located <2 arcsec away from the nominal XRT positions, suggesting that the XRT
is capable of delivering highly accurate positions, which will revolutionize
afterglow studies.",2005-02-23T02:08:14Z
A Spectroscopic Study of HL Canis Majoris,"We present optical spectroscopy of the dwarf nova HL Canis Majoris over a
span of four years. The observations were made during standstill, outburst, and
quiescence. We determine an orbital period of 0.2167867 +/- 0.0000017 days,
based on radial velocities determined from H-alpha, H-beta, and He I 5876
emission. We also present equivalent widths of the spectral features in
outburst and in quiescence.",2005-06-02T22:01:15Z
Mass Limit on Nemesis,"We assume that if the sun has a companion, it has a period of 27 Myr
corresponding to the periodicity seen in cometary impacts on earth. Based on
this assumption, it is seen that the inner Lagrengian point of the interaction
between the Sun and its companion is in the Oort cloud. From this we calculate
the mass -- distance relation for the companion. We then compute the expected
apparent magnitude (visible and J band) for the companion using the models of
Burrows (1993). We then compare this with the catalogue completeness of optical
and infrared catalogues to show that the sun cannot have a companion of mass
greater than 44 M_jup (0.042 M_sun)",2005-02-20T16:33:11Z
"Filaments as Possible Signatures of Magnetic Field Structure in
  Planetary Nebulae","We draw attention to the extreme filamentary structures seen in
high-resolution optical images of certain planetary nebulae. We determine the
physical properties of the filaments in the nebulae IC 418, NGC 3132, and NGC
6537, and based on their large length-to-width ratios, longitudinal coherence,
and morphology, we suggest that they may be signatures of the underlying
magnetic field. The fields needed for the coherence of the filaments are
probably consistent with those measured in the precursor circumstellar
envelopes. The filaments suggest that magnetic fields in planetary nebulae may
have a localized and thread-like geometry.",2005-03-31T00:43:10Z
"Radial Velocity Jitter in Stars from the California and Carnegie Planet
  Search at Keck Observatory","I present an empirical model for predicting a star's radial velocity jitter
from its B-V color, activity level, and absolute magnitude. This model is based
on observations of 450 well- observed stars from Keck Observatory for the
California and Carnegie Planet Search Program. The model includes noise from
both astrophysical sources and systematic errors, and describes jitter as
generally increasing with a star's activity and height above the main sequence.",2005-05-11T00:17:06Z
Period recovery success rate expected with Gaia,"The Gaia satellite was selected as a cornerstone mission of the European
Space Agency (ESA) in October 2000 and confirmed in 2002 with a current target
launch date of 2011. The Gaia mission will gather on the same observational
principles as Hipparcos detailed astrometric, photometric and spectroscopic
properties of about 1 billion sources brighter than mag V=20. The nature of the
measured objects ranges from NEOs to gamma ray burst afterglows and encompasses
virtually any kind of stars in our Galaxy. Gaia will provide multi-colour (in
about 20 passbands extending over the visible range) photometry with typically
250 observations distributed over 40 well separated epochs during the 5-year
mission. The multi-epoch nature of the project will permit to detect and
analyse variable sources whose number is currently estimated in the range of
several tens of million, among the detectable sources.
  In this paper, we assess the performances of Gaia in analysing photometric
periodic phenomena. We first present quickly the overall observational
principle before discussing the implication of the scanning law in the time
sampling. Then from extensive simulations one assesses the performances in the
recovery of periodic signals as a function of the period, signal-to-noise ratio
and position on the sky for simple sinusoidal variability.",2005-06-16T20:14:43Z
"Beyond the Galaxy with Gaia: evolutionary histories of galaxies in the
  Local Group","Gaia will play an important role in providing information about star
formation histories, merging events, intergalactic streams etc., for nearby
galaxies of the Local Group. One of the most crucial contributions will be
proper motions, especially for stars in the outermost parts of the galaxies,
obtainable for stellar populations to ~150 kpc with RGB stars. Together with
radial velocities for the brightest giants <80 kpc, this will provide
membership information for individual stars and global kinematical picture of
the most nearby galaxies, including the Magellanic Clouds (MCs). Gaia will also
provide photometric metallicities (\sigma([M/H])<0.3) for individual giants
and/or supergiants in dwarf galaxies to ~200 kpc. MSTO ages will be possible
for the youngest stellar populations in the most nearby galaxies (e.g., MCs),
whereas stars on RGB/AGB may provide age estimates for populations to ~150 kpc.
Gaia will allow to study the outermost parts of the galaxies, which (because of
their large spatial extent) are difficult to assess from the ground. Apart from
allowing to clarify the structure and evolution of the dwarf galaxies, this
will also make it possible to investigate galactic tidal debris, thus providing
additional details for the global picture of formation and evolution of the
Milky Way Galaxy.",2005-03-09T10:23:49Z
Cooling Evolution of Hybrid Stars,"The cooling of compact isolated objects for different values of the
gravitational mass has been simulated for two alternative assumptions. One is
that the interior of the star is purely hadronic and second that the star can
have a rather large quark core. It has been shown that within a nonlocal chiral
quark model the critical density for a phase transition to color
superconducting quark matter under neutron star conditions can be low enough
for these phases to occur in compact star configurations with masses below 1.3
M_sun. For a realistic choice of parameters the equation of state (EoS) allows
for 2SC quark matter with a large quark gap ~ 100 MeV for u and d quarks of two
colors that coexists with normal quark matter within a mixed phase in the
hybrid star interior. We argue that, if in the hadronic phase the neutron
pairing gap in 3P_2 channel is larger than few keV and the phases with unpaired
quarks are allowed, the corresponding hybrid stars would cool too fast.
  Even in the case of the essentially suppressed 3P_2 neutron gap if free
quarks occur for M < 1.3 M_sun, as it follows from our EoS, one could not
appropriately describe the neutron star cooling data existing by today.
  It is suggested to discuss a ""2SC+X"" phase, as a possibility to have all
quarks paired in two-flavor quark matter under neutron star constraints, where
the X-gap is of the order of 10 keV - 1 MeV. Density independent gaps do not
allow to fit the cooling data. Only the presence of an X-gap that decreases
with increase of the density could allow to appropriately fit the data in a
similar compact star mass interval to that following from a purely hadronic
model.",2005-02-28T15:46:16Z
Cosmic Rays from Gamma Ray Bursts in the Galaxy,"The rate of terrestrial irradiation events by galactic gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) is estimated using recent standard-energy results. We assume that GRBs
accelerate high-energy cosmic rays, and present results of three-dimensional
simulations of cosmic rays moving in the Galactic magnetic field and diffusing
through pitch-angle scattering. An on-axis GRB extinction event begins with a
powerful prompt gamma-ray and neutron pulse, followed by a longer-lived phase
from cosmic-ray protons and neutron-decay protons that diffuse towards Earth.
Our results force a reinterpretation of reported ~ 10^{18} eV cosmic-ray
anisotropies and offer a rigorous test of the model where high-energy cosmic
rays originate from GRBs, which will soon be tested with the Auger Observatory.",2005-04-06T18:53:22Z
"The Nature of Nearby Counterparts to Intermediate Redshift Luminous
  Compact Blue Galaxies II. CO Observations","We present the results of a single-dish beam-matched survey of the three
lowest rotational transitions of CO in a sample of 20 local (D < 70 Mpc)
Luminous Compact Blue Galaxies (LCBGs). These ~L*, blue, high surface
brightness, starbursting galaxies were selected with the same criteria used to
define LCBGs at higher redshifts. Our detection rate was 70%, with those
galaxies having Lblue<7e9 Lsun no detected. We find the H2 masses of local
LCBGs range from 6.6e6 to 2.7e9 Msun, assuming a Galactic CO-to-H2 conversion
factor. Combining these results with our earlier HI survey of the same sample,
we find that the ratio of molecular to atomic gas mass is low, typically 5-10%.
Using a Large Velocity Gradient model, we find that the average gas conditions
of the entire ISM in local LCBGs are similar to those found in the centers of
star forming regions in our Galaxy, and nuclear regions of other galaxies. Star
formation rates, determined from IRAS fluxes, are a few solar masses per year,
much higher per unit dynamical mass than normal spirals. If this rate remains
constant, the molecular hydrogen depletion time scales are short, 10-200 Myr.",2005-02-03T03:14:12Z
"Water masers in the massive protostar IRAS 20126+4104: ejection and
  deceleration","We report on the first multi-epoch, phase referenced VLBI observations of the
water maser emission in a high-mass protostar associated with a disk-jet
system. The source under study, IRAS 20126+4104, has been extensively
investigated in a large variety of tracers, including water maser VLBA data
acquired by us three years before the present observations. The new findings
fully confirm the interpretation proposed in our previous study, namely that
the maser spots are expanding from a common origin coincident with the
protostar. We also demonstrate that the observed 3-D velocities of the maser
spots can be fitted with a model assuming that the spots are moving along the
surface of a conical jet, with speed increasing for increasing distance from
the cone vertex. We also present the results of single-dish monitoring of the
water maser spectra in IRAS 20126+4104. These reveal that the peak velocity of
some maser lines decreases linearly with time. We speculate that such a
deceleration could be due to braking of the shocks from which the maser
emission originates, due to mass loading at the shock front or dissipation of
the shock energy.",2005-04-25T14:49:21Z
"Clustering of SZ clusters on a past light-cone: acoustic oscillations
  and constraints on dark energy","In this paper we study the clustering of SZ-selected galaxy clusters on a
past light-cone, particularly paying attention to the possibility of
constraining properties of dark energy. The prospects of detecting baryonic
features in the cluster power spectrum for a wide and shallow survey like
PLANCK, and for an SPT-like narrow and deep survey are discussed. It is
demonstrated that these future blank sky SZ surveys will have capability to
improve significantly over the recently announced detection of baryonic
oscillations based on the SDSS Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample. We carry out
parameter estimation using Fisher matrix approach taking into account the
anisotropic nature of the power spectrum due to redshift space and cosmological
distortions. The clustering signal which is not too sensitive to systematic
uncertainties serves as a valuable piece of information that in combination
with other sources of data helps in breaking degeneracies between the
cosmological parameters.",2005-05-20T14:46:29Z

Overview of Technical Approaches to RFI Mitigation,"This overview provides an interface between lines of thought on rfi
mitigation in the fields of radio astronomy and signal processing. The goal is
to explore the commonality of different approaches to help researchers in both
fields interpret each others' concepts and jargon. The paper elaborates on the
astronomers' concept of gain closure relations and how they may be used in a
""self-calibrating"" system of rfi cancellation. Further discussion of the eigen
decomposition method in terms of rfi power and antenna gains introduces
adaptive nulling and rfi cancellation through matrix partitioning. While
multipath scattering appears at first glance to be fatal to methods of rfi
cancellation, its effect is easily incorporated in frequency dependent gain
coefficients under many circumstances.",2005-02-16T07:28:25Z
The XMM-Newton view of Mrk3 and IXO30,"We present the analysis of the XMM-Newton EPIC pn spectrum of the Seyfert 2
galaxy, Mrk3. We confirm that the source is dominated by a pure Compton
reflection component and an iron K$\alpha$ line, both produced as reflection
from a Compton-thick torus, likely responsible also for the large column
density which is pierced by the primary powerlaw only at high energies. A low
inclination angle and an iron underabundance, suggested by the amount of
reflection and the depth of the iron edge, are consistent with the iron
K$\alpha$ line EW with respect to the Compton reflection component. Moreover,
the iron line width, if interpreted in terms of Doppler broadening due to the
Keplerian rotation of the torus, puts an estimate to the inner radius of the
latter, $r=0.6^{+1.3}_{-0.3} \sin^2{i}$ pc. Finally, two different photoionised
reflectors are needed to take into account a large number of soft X-ray
emission lines from N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, Fe L and the FeXXV emission line. RGS
spectra show that the soft X-ray spectrum is dominated by emission lines, while
the underlying continuum is best fitted by an unabsorbed powerlaw with the same
photon index of the primary continuum, produced as reflection by a photoionised
material with a column density of a few $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. We also present
the first X-ray spectrum of ROSAT source IXO30, which shows a huge iron line
and is well represented either by an absorbed powerlaw or bremsstrahlung
emission. Its spectral properties point to a likely identification in terms of
a weak Galactic Cataclysmic Variable, but the lack of any optical counterpart
precludes excluding other possibilities, like an ULX at the distance of Mrk3.",2005-03-29T15:24:54Z
"What Can the Distribution of Intergalactic Metals Tell us About the
  History of Cosmological Enrichment?","I study the relationship between the spatial distribution of intergalactic
metals and the masses and ejection energies of the sources that produced them.
Over a wide range of models, metal enrichment is dominated by the smallest
efficient sources, as the enriched volume scales roughly as E^{3/5} ~ M^{3/5}
while the number density of sources goes as 1/M. In all cases, the earliest
sources have the biggest impact, because fixed comoving distances correspond to
smaller physical distances at higher redshifts. This means that most of the
enriched volume is found around rare peaks, and intergalactic metals are
naturally highly clustered. Furthermore, this clustering is so strong as to
lead to a large overlap between individual bubbles. Thus the typical radius of
enriched z ~ 3 regions should be interpreted as a constraint on groupings of
sources rather than the ejection radius of a typical source. Similarly, the
clustering of enriched regions should be taken as a measurement of source bias
rather than mass.",2005-04-04T20:01:39Z
Discovery of Solar Rieger Periodicities in Another Star,"The Rieger periods are solar cycles with a time scale of months, which are
present in both flaring activity and sunspot occurrence. These short-term
periodicities, tentatively explained by equatorially trapped Rossby-type waves
modulating the emergence of magnetic flux at the surface, are considered a
peculiar and not yet fully understood solar phenomenon. We chose a stellar
system with solar characteristics, UX Arietis, and performed a timing analysis
of two 9-year datasets of radio and optical observations. The analysis reveals
a 294-day cycle. When the two 9-year datasets are folded with this period, a
synchronization of the peak of the optical light curve (i.e., the minimum spot
coverage) with the minimum radio flaring activity is observed. This close
relationship between two completly independent curves makes it very likely that
the 294-day cycle is real. We conclude that the process invoked for the Sun of
a periodical emergence of magnetic flux may also be applied to UX Arietis and
can explain the cyclic flaring activity triggered by interactions between
successive cyclic emergences of magnetic flux.",2005-03-11T11:32:06Z
"Galactic Wind Effects on the Lyman-alpha Absorption in the Vicinity of
  Galaxies","We present predictions of Ly-alpha forest-galaxy correlations at z=3 from
Eulerian simulations that include the effects of galactic winds, driven
primarily by supernova explosions. Galactic winds produce expanding bubbles of
shock-heated gas within ~0.5 comoving Mpc/h of luminous galaxies in the
simulation, which have space density similar to that of observed Lyman break
galaxies (LBGs). However, most of the low-density intergalactic gas that
determines the observed properties of the Ly-alpha forest is unaffected by
winds. The impact of winds on the Ly-alpha optical depth near galaxies is less
dramatic than their impact on gas temperature because winds heat only a small
fraction of the gas present in the turnaround regions surrounding galaxies.
Hence, Ly-alpha absorption from gas outside the wind bubbles is spread out over
the same velocity range occupied by the wind-heated gas. In general, Ly-alpha
absorption is expected to be stronger than average near galaxies because of the
high gas density. Winds result in a modest reduction of this expected increase
of Ly-alpha absorption. Our predictions can be compared to future observations
to detect the wind effects and infer their strength, although with the caveat
that the results are still dependent on the correspondence of simulated
galaxies and observed LBGs. We find that wind effects in our simulations are
not strong enough to reproduce the high Ly-alpha transmission within 0.5 Mpc/h
comoving of galaxies that has been suggested by recent observations; powerful
galactic explosions or ejecta with hyper-escape velocities would be required,
but these are unlikely to be produced by ordinary star formation and supernovae
alone",2005-03-30T21:01:29Z
"Quasar Spectrum Classification with PCA - II: Introduction of Five
  Classes, Artificial Quasar Spectrum, the Mean Flux Correction Factor dF,and
  the Identification of Emission Lines in the Ly alpha Forest","We investigate the variety in quasar UV spectra (1020-1600A) with emphasis on
the weak emission lines in the Ly alpha forest region using principal component
analysis (PCA). This paper is a continuation of Suzuki et al. (2005, Paper I),
but with a different approach. We use 50 smooth continuum fitted quasar spectra
(0.14 < z < 1.04) taken by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Faint Object
Spectrograph. Three weak emission lines in the Ly alpha forest are identified
as FeII 1070.95A, FeII+FeIII 1123.17A, and CIII* 1175.88A. Using first two
standardized PCS coefficients, we introduce five classifications: Class Zero
and Class I-IV. These classifications will guide us in finding the continuum
level in the Ly alpha forest, and we discuss the characteristics of each class.
We show weak emission lines in the Ly alpha forest become eminent for Class III
and IV. By actively using PCS, we can generate artificial quasar spectra which
are useful to test the detection of quasars, DLAs, and the continuum
calibration. We provide 10,000 artificially generated spectra. We show that the
power-law extrapolated continuum is inadequate to perform precise measurements
of the mean flux in the Ly alpha forest because of the weak emission lines and
the extended tails of Ly alpha and Ly beta/OVI emission lines. We introduce a
correction factor dF such that the true mean flux <F> can be related to
<F_{Power-Law}> that is measured by using power-law continuum extrapolation:
<F> = <F_{Power-Law}> dF. The correction factor dF ranges from 0.84 to 1.05
with a mean of 0.947 and a standard deviation of 0.031 for our 50 quasars. This
result means that we miss 5.3% of flux on average and we show that there are
cases where we would miss 16% of flux using a power-law extrapolation.",2005-03-10T21:00:05Z
Reversals of radio emission direction in PSR B1822-09,"The pulse profile of pulsar B1822-09 exhibits a very peculiar kind of mode
changing: a ""precursor"" appearing just in front of the Main-Pulse (MP) exhibits
periods of nulling, during which an interpulse (IP) becomes detectable at
rotation phase separated by roughly 180 deg from the precursor. We propose that
this bizarre phenomenon, which requires an information transfer between the two
components, occurs by means of reversal of a direction of coherent radio
emission generated in the same emission region. This interpretation naturally
explains the lack of weak radio emission in the off-pulse regions, as well as
the problem of information transfer between emission regions associated with
the MP precursor and the IP. The reversals also imply nulling. The model has
profound physical implications: (i) the mechanism of coherent radio emission
must allow radiation into two, opposite, intermittently changing directions;
(ii) the radio waves must be able to propagate through inner regions of the
neutron star magnetosphere with strong magnetic field. Most importantly, the
model implies inward radio emission in pulsar magnetosphere.",2005-03-18T13:12:13Z
"An indirect limit on the amplitude of primordial Gravitational Wave
  Background from CMB-Galaxy Cross Correlation","While large scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies involve a
combination of the scalar and tensor fluctuations, the scalar amplitude can be
independently determined through the CMB-galaxy cross-correlation. Using
recently measured cross-correlation amplitudes, arising from the
cross-correlation between galaxies and the Integrated Sachs Wolfe effect in CMB
anisotropies, we obtain a constraint r < 0.5 at 68% confidence level on the
tensor-to-scalar fluctuation amplitude ratio. The data also allow us to exclude
gravity waves at a level of a few percent, relative to the density field, in a
low - Lambda dominated universe(Omega_Lambda~0.5). In future, joining
cross-correlation ISW measurements, which captures cosmological parameter
information, with independent determinations of the matter density and CMB
anisotropy power spectrum, may constrain the tensor-to-scalar ratio to a level
above 0.05. This value is the ultimate limit on tensor-to-scalar ratio from
temperature anisotropy maps when all other cosmological parameters except for
the tensor amplitude are known and the combination with CMB-galaxy correlation
allows this limit to be reached easily by accounting for degeneracies in
certain cosmological parameters.",2005-04-13T08:26:36Z
Simulating galaxy clusters : the ICM and the galaxy populations,"Cosmological LambdaCDM TreeSPH simulations of the formation and evolution of
galaxy groups and clusters have been performed. The simulations include: star
formation, chemical evolution with non-instantaneous recycling, metal dependent
radiative cooling, strong star burst and (optionally) AGN driven galactic super
winds, effects of a meta-galactic UV field and thermal conduction. We report
results on the temperature and entropy profiles of the ICM, the X-ray
luminosity, cold fraction, M/L and IMLR ratios in gas and stars, metal
abundances and gradients. Besides, the properties of the galaxy populations in
the two richest clusters are discussed: global star formation rates of the
cluster galaxies, the total K-band luminosity, the galaxy luminosity functions
at z=0 and their redshift evolution, the colour-magnitude relation (``red
sequence'') as resulting from metallicity effects, and the role of the IMF in
reproducing colours and abundances of the stellar populations. Finally the
contribute (20-40 %) to cluster light from the intra-cluster stars and the cD
galaxy has been investigated: surface brightness profiles, mean colours and
chemical abundances, kinematics (velocity dispersion and distributions) of the
IC stellar populations.",2005-04-15T13:44:59Z
Measuring diffuse neutrino fluxes with IceCube,"In this paper the sensitivity of a future kilometer-sized neutrino detector
to detect and measure the diffuse flux of high energy neutrinos is evaluated.
Event rates in established detection channels, such as muon events from charged
current muon neutrino interactions or cascade events from electron neutrino and
tau neutrino interactions, are calculated using a detailed Monte Carlo
simulation. Neutrino fluxes as expected from prompt charm decay in the
atmosphere or from astrophysical sources such as Active Galactic Nuclei are
modeled assuming power laws. The ability to measure the normalization and slope
of these spectra is then analyzed.
  It is found that the cascade channel generally has a high sensitivity for the
detection and characterization of the diffuse flux, when compared to what is
expected for the upgoing- and downgoing-muon channels. A flux at the level of
the Waxman-Bahcall upper bound should be detectable in all channels separately
while a combination of the information of the different channels will allow
detection of a flux more than one order of magnitude lower. Neutrinos from the
prompt decay of charmed mesons in the atmosphere should be detectable in future
measurements for all but the lowest predictions.",2005-05-25T10:03:10Z
Cosmic microwave background polarization analysis,"With polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) now detected, and
confirmed by several independent experiments, the next goal is to characterise
accurately its statistical properties. In these lecture notes we review the
physical motivation for pursuing CMB polarization, and the basic statistical
properties of the polarization fields. We then discuss some of the key aspects
of the analysis of CMB polarization data, focusing on the additional
complications that arise compared to temperature data due to the tensor
character of the polarization field.",2005-02-04T11:01:28Z
Neutron Diffusion and Nucleosynthesis in an Inhomogeneous Big Bang Model,"This article presents an original code for Big Bang Nucleosynthesis in a
baryon inhomogeneous model of the universe. In this code neutron diffusion
between high and low baryon density regions is calculated simultaneously with
the nuclear reactions and weak decays that compose the nucleosynthesis process.
The size of the model determines the time when neutron diffusion becomes
significant. This article describes in detail how the time of neutron diffusion
relative to the time of nucleosynthesis affects the final abundances of He4,
deuterium and Li7. These results will be compared with the most recent
observational constraints of He4, deuterium and Li7. This inhomogeneous model
has He4 and deuterium constraints in concordance for baryon to photon ratio eta
= (4.3 - 12.3) X 10^{-10} Li7 constraints are brought into concordance with the
other isotope constraints by including a depletion factor as high as 5.9. These
ranges for the baryon to photon ratio and for the depletion factor are larger
than the ranges from a Standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis model.",2005-06-16T01:23:40Z
"The Multipole Vectors of WMAP, and their frames and invariants","We investigate the Statistical Isotropy and Gaussianity of the CMB
fluctuations, using a set of multipole vector functions capable of separating
these two issues. In general a multipole is broken into a frame and $2\ell-3$
ordered invariants. The multipole frame is found to be suitably sensitive to
galactic cuts. We then apply our method to real WMAP datasets; a coadded masked
map, the Internal Linear Combinations map, and Wiener filtered and cleaned
maps. Taken as a whole, multipoles in the range $\ell=2-10$ or $\ell=2-20$ show
consistency with statistical isotropy, as proved by the Kolmogorov test applied
to the frame's Euler angles. This result in {\it not} inconsistent with
previous claims for a preferred direction in the sky for $\ell=2,...5$. The
multipole invariants also show overall consistency with Gaussianity apart from
a few anomalies of limited significance (98%), listed at the end of this paper.",2005-02-28T14:12:36Z
Millisecond Proto-Magnetars & Gamma Ray Bursts,"In the seconds after core collapse and explosion, a thermal neutrino-driven
wind emerges from the cooling, deleptonizing newly-born neutron star. If the
neutron star has a large-scale magnetar-strength surface magnetic field and
millisecond rotation period, then the wind is driven primarily by
magneto-centrifugal slinging, and only secondarily by neutrino interactions.
The strong magnetic field forces the wind to corotate with the stellar surface
and the neutron star's rotational energy is efficiently extracted. As the
neutron star cools, and the wind becomes increasingly magnetically-dominated,
the outflow becomes relativistic. Here I review the millisecond magnetar model
for long-duration gamma ray bursts and explore some of the basic physics of
neutrino-magnetocentrifugal winds. I further speculate on some issues of
collimation and geometry in the millisecond magnetar model.",2005-04-27T21:19:48Z
"Constraining fundamental stellar parameters using seismology.
  Application to Alpha Centauri AB","We apply the Levenberg-Marquardt minimization algorithm to seismic and
classical observables of the Alpha Cen binary system in order to derive the
fundamental parameters of Alpha Cen A+B and to analyze the dependence of these
parameters on the chosen observables, on their uncertainty and on the physics
used in stellar modelling. The seismological data are those by Bouchy & Carrier
(2002) for Alpha Cen A, and those by Carrier & Bourban (2003) for Alpha Cen B.
We show that while the fundamental stellar parameters do not depend on the
treatment of convection adopted (Mixing Length Theory -- MLT -- or ``Full
Spectrum of Turbulence'' -- FST), the age of the system depends on the
inclusion of gravitational settling, and is deeply biased by the small
frequency separation of component B.
  We try to answer the question of the universality of the mixing length
parameter, and we find a statistically reliable dependence of the
alpha--parameter on the HR diagram location (with a trend similar to the one
predicted by Ludwig et al.1999).
  We propose the frequency separation ratios introduced by Roxburgh &
Voronstsov (2003) as better observables to determine the fundamental stellar
parameters, and to use the large frequency separation and frequencies to
extract information about the stellar structure. The effects of diffusion and
equation of state on the oscillation frequencies are also studied, but present
seismic data do not allow their detection.",2005-05-26T14:04:41Z
MHD Simulations of Relic Radio Bubbles in Clusters,"In order to better understand the origin and evolution of relic radio bubbles
in clusters of galaxies, we report on an extensive set of 2D MHD simulations of
hot buoyant bubbles evolving in a realistic intracluster medium. Our bubbles
are inflated near the base of the ICM over a finite time interval from a region
whose magnetic field is isolated from the ICM. We confirm both the early
conjecture from linear analysis and the later results based on preformed MHD
bubbles; namely, that very modest ICM magnetic fields can stabilize the rising
bubbles against disruption by Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities. We find in addition that amplification of the ambient fields as
they stretch around the bubbles can be sufficient to protect the bubbles or
their initial fragments even if the fields are initially much too weak to play
a significant role early in the evolution of the bubbles. Indeed, even with
initial fields less than a micro-Gauss and values of $\beta = P_g/P_b$
approaching $10^5$, magnetic stresses in our simulations eventually became
large enough to influence the bubble evolution. Magnetic field influence also
depends significantly on the geometry of the ICM field and on the topology of
the field at the bubble/ICM interface. For example, reconnection of
anti-parallel fields across the bubble top greatly reduced the ability of the
magnetic field to inhibit disruptive instabilities. Our results confirm earlier
estimates of $10^8$ yr for relic radio bubble lifetimes and show that magnetic
fields can account for the long term stability of these objects against
disruption by surface instabilities. In addition these calculations show that
lifting and mixing of the ambient ICM may be a critical function of field
geometries in both the ICM and in the bubble interior.",2005-02-07T17:42:14Z
Photometric observations of Grid Giant Star Survey candidates,"We compare variability of radial velocity (RV) and brightness for a sample of
red giants which were selected as candidates for the Grid Giant Star Survey
(GGSS). The purpose of the survey is to select astrometrically stable stars as
a reference frame for the future Space Interferometry Mission. We incorporate
photometric data taken by ROTSE-I and being taken by ROTSE-III robotic
telescopes. Typically 2/3 of all GGSS stars to the north of DEC=-35 were
observed 76 and 8 times by ROTSE-I and III respectively in white-light filters.
It is shown that photometric stability at the 0.02 mag level cannot be used for
a pre-selection of RV-stable stars, and the most important tool remains
high-resolution spectroscopy. We deeply thank the ROTSE collaboration providing
us observing time at the ROTSE-IIIb telescope. We gratefully acknowledge NASA
grant NRA-99-04-OSS-058.",2005-02-18T06:33:58Z
Cosmology with massive neutrinos coupled to dark energy,"Cosmological consequences of a coupling between massive neutrinos and dark
energy are investigated. In such models, the neutrino mass is a function of a
scalar field, which plays the role of dark energy. The background evolution, as
well as the evolution of cosmological perturbations is discussed. We find that
mass-varying neutrinos can leave a significant imprint on the anisotropies in
the cosmic microwave background radiation and even lead to a reduction of power
on large angular scales.",2005-03-16T15:55:01Z
The Colours of Elliptical galaxies,"We have compiled a sample of 2728 nearby ($z<0.08$) elliptical galaxies with
photometry in the $g,r,i,z$ bands from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and
$J,H,K$ photometry from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). Stellar masses,
stellar velocity dispersions and structural parameters such as sizes and
surface mass densities are also available for these objects. In order to
correct the aperture mismatch between SDSS and 2MASS, we correct the SDSS
magnitudes to the isophotal circular radius where the 2MASS magnitudes are
measured. We compare the correlations between optical, optical-infrared and
infrared colours and galaxy luminosity, stellar mass, velocity dispersion and
surface mass density. We find that all galaxy colours correlate more strongly
with stellar mass and velocity dispersion than with any other structural
parameter. The dispersion about these two relations is also smaller.
  We also study the correlations between a variety of stellar absorption line
indices and the same set of galaxy parameters and we reach very similar
conclusions. Finally, we analyze correlations between absorption line indices
and colour. Our results suggest that the optical colours of elliptical galaxies
are sensitive to a combination of age, metallicity and $\alpha$-enhancement,
while the optical-infrared colours are sensitive to metallicity and to
$\alpha$-enhancement, but are somewhat less sensitive to age.",2005-02-05T01:41:53Z
Redshift indicators for gamma-ray bursts,"The measure of the distances and luminosities of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) led
to the discovery that many GRB properties are strongly correlated with their
intrinsic luminosity, leading to the construction of reliable luminosity
indicators. These GRB luminosity indicators have quickly found applications,
like the construction of 'pseudo-redshifts', or the measure of luminosity
distances, which can be computed independently of the measure of the redshift.
In this contribution I discuss various issues connected with the construction
of luminosity-redshift indicators for gamma-ray bursts.",2005-05-04T15:18:11Z
"Further evidence for a merger in Abell 2218 from an XMM-Newton
  observation","(Abridged) The galaxy cluster Abell 2218, at z=0.171, is well-known for the
discrepancy between mass estimates derived from X-ray and strong lensing
analyses. With the present XMM observation, we trace the gas density and
temperature profiles out to a radius of ~ 1400 h_70^-1 kpc (approximately the
virial radius of the cluster). The surface brightness profile is well fitted
over three orders of magnitude with a beta model, with a core radius of 0.'95
and \beta=0.63. The projected temperature profile declines steeply with radius
(by ~50%), and is well described by a polytrope with parameters t_0=8.09 keV
and \gamma=1.15. The temperature map shows a pronounced peak in the central
arcminute, with an increase of a factor of two (from ~5 to ~10 keV). The mass
profile, calculated assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry, is
best fitted with a King approximation to an isothermal sphere, implying a dark
matter distribution with a central core, in contrast with the cusped cores
found in more obviously relaxed clusters. The X-ray mass is two times less than
the strong lensing mass at r ~ 80 h_50^-1 kpc, although the agreement between
X-ray and weak lensing mass measurements at larger radius (r ~ 400 h_50^-1 kpc)
is slightly better. While the X-ray total mass estimates can vary by 30%
depending on the mass model, all measurements are lower than the corresponding
total mass from optical measurements. Given the X-ray results indicating
disturbance of the intracluster gas, leading to a likely violation of the
assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, and the observed substructure in the
optical, suggesting a line-of-sight merger, it is unlikely that the different
mass estimates of this cluster can be reconciled, at least with standard
modelling assumptions.",2005-02-16T16:58:20Z
"GSC 4232.2830, an Eclipsing Binary with Elliptical Orbit","The discovery of an Algol type eclipsing variable star having highly
elliptical orbit with the period of 11.628 day is reported.",2005-05-20T18:58:22Z
High Redshift Supernovae: Cosmological Implications,"We review the findings for the values of the cosmological parameters as
derived from high-redshift SNIa measurements. The most recent results confirm
the picture of a non-empty inflationary Universe that is consistent with a
cosmological constant Omega_Lambda~0.7. This implies that the expansion of the
Universe is currently accelerated by the action of some mysterious dark energy.
We also discuss the possibility and the consequences of the fact that SNIa may
not be ""perfect"" standard candles, in the sense of having properties in the
early Universe that are systematically different from those they have at the
present times.",2005-02-11T23:07:12Z
Likelihood Analysis of GRB Evolution with Redshift,"We present a likelihood approach to modeling multi-dimensional GRB
Epeak--fluence--redshift data that naturally incorporates instrument detection
thresholds. The treatment of instrument thresholds is essential for analyzing
evidence for GRB evolution. The method described here compares the data to a
uniform jet model, in which the jet parameters are allowed to vary with
redshift. Data from different experiments may be modeled jointly. In addition,
BATSE data (for which no redshift information is available) may be incorporated
by ascribing to each event a likelihood derived from the full model by
integrating the probability density over the unknown redshift. The loss of
redshift information is mitigated by the large number of available bursts. We
discuss the implementation of the method, and validation of it using simulated
data.",2005-05-08T17:01:01Z
The polarized electron target as a new solar-neutrino detector,"In this paper, we analyze the scattering of solar neutrinos on the polarized
electron target, and predict how the effect of parity violation in weak
interactions may help to distinguish neutrino signal from detector background.
We indicate that the knowledge of the Sun motion across the sky is sufficient
to predict the day/night asymmetry in the $(\nu_ee^-)$ scattering on the
polarized electron target. To make this detection feasible, the polarized
electron target for solar neutrinos needs to be build from magnetic materials,
e.g. from ferromagnetic iron foils, paramagnetic scintillator crystals or
scintillating ferrofluids.",2005-02-24T20:45:37Z
Anti-Truncation of Disks in Early-Type Barred Galaxies,"The disks of spiral galaxies are commonly thought to be truncated: the radial
surface brightness profile steepens sharply beyond a certain radius (3--5
inner-disk scale lengths). Here we present the radial brightness profiles of a
number of barred S0--Sb galaxies with the opposite behavior: their outer
profiles are distinctly shallower in slope than the main disk profile. We term
these ""anti-truncations""; they are found in at least 25% of a larger sample of
barred S0--Sb galaxies. There are two distinct types of anti-truncations. About
one-third show a fairly gradual transition and outer isophotes which are
progressively rounder than the main disk isophotes, suggestive of a disk
embedded within a more spheroidal outer zone -- either the outer extent of the
bulge or a separate stellar halo. But the majority of the profiles have rather
sharp surface-brightness transitions to the shallower, outer exponential
profile and, crucially, outer isophotes which are not significantly rounder
than the main disk; in the Sab--Sb galaxies, the outer isophotes include
visible spiral arms. This suggests that the outer light is still part of the
disk. A subset of these profiles are in galaxies with asymmetric outer
isophotes (lopsided or one-armed spirals), suggesting that interactions may be
responsible for at least some of the disklike anti-truncations.",2005-05-11T17:07:07Z
"On the fine structure of the sunspot penumbrae. II. The nature of the
  Evershed flow","We investigate the fine structure of the sunspot penumbra by means of a model
that allows for a flux tube in horizontal pressure balance with the magnetic
background atmosphere in which it is embedded. We apply this model to
spectropolarimetric observations of two neutral iron lines at 1.56 $\mu$m and
invert several radial cuts in the penumbra of the same sunspot at two different
heliocentric angles. In the inner part of the penumbra we find hot flux tubes
that are somewhat inclined to the horizontal. They become gradually more
horizontal and cooler with increasing radial distance. This is accompanied by
an increase in the velocity of the plasma and a decrease of the gas pressure
difference between flux tube and the background component. At large radial
distances the flow speed exceeds the critical speed and evidence is found for
the formation of a shock front. These results are in good agreement with
simulations of the penumbral fine structure and provide strong support for the
siphon flow as the physical mechanism driving the Evershed flow.",2005-03-30T21:13:26Z
"Uncertainties of Cosmic Ray Spectra and Detectability of Antiproton
  mSUGRA Contributions With PAMELA","We studied the variation of $e^+$ and $\bar p$ top of the atmosphere spectra
due to the parameters uncertainties of the Milky Way geometry, propagation
models and cross sections. We used the B/C data and Galprop code for the
propagation analysis. We also derived the uncertainty bands for subFe/Fe ratio,
H and He. Finally, we considered a neutralino induced component in the
antiproton flux in the mSUGRA framework. PAMELA expectations for positrons and
antiprotons are calculated. We studied in details the possibility of
disentanglement of an eventual signal component in the antiproton spectra in a
clumpy halo scenario: minimal values of clumpiness factors necessary to
disentangle the signal from the background without violating the quality of the
antiproton data fit are found. There are also given examples of total spectra
in comparison with existing experimental data and an example of PAMELA
prediction for the total spectra. The main result of this work is that for the
diffusion and convection background model PAMELA will be able to disentangle an
eventual supersymmetric signal even for small clumpiness factors.",2005-02-21T13:06:23Z
"Detection of anomalous microwave emission in the Perseus molecular cloud
  with the COSMOSOMAS experiment","We present direct evidence for anomalous microwave emission in the Perseus
molecular cloud, which shows a clear rising spectrum from 11 to 17 GHz in the
data of the COSMOSOMAS experiment. By extending the frequency coverage using
WMAP maps convolved with the COSMOSOMAS scanning pattern we reveal a peak flux
density of 42 (+/-) 4 Jy at 22 GHz integrated over an extended area of 1.65 x
1.0 deg centered on RA = 55.4 (+/-) 0.1 deg and Dec = 31.8 (+/-) 0.1 deg
(J2000). The flux density that we measure at this frequency is nearly an order
of magnitude higher than can be explained in terms of normal galactic emission
processes (synchrotron, free-free and thermal dust). An extended IRAS dust
feature G159.6-18.5 is found near this position and no bright unresolved source
which could be an ultracompact HII region or gigahertz peaked source could be
found. An adequate fit for the spectral density distribution can be achieved
from 10 to 50 GHz by including a very significant contribution from electric
dipole emission from small spinning dust grains.",2005-03-31T20:45:21Z
"Dynamical and photometric imprints of feedback processes on the early
  evolution of E/S0 galaxies","We show that the observed Velocity Dispersion Function of E/S0 galaxies
matches strikingly well the distribution function of virial velocities of
massive halos virializing at z > 1.5, as predicted by the standard hierarchical
clustering scenario in a \LambdaCDM cosmology, for a constant ratio sigma/V_vir
= 0.55 \pm 0.05, close to the value expected at virialization if it typically
occurred at z > 3. This strongly suggests that dissipative processes and later
merging events had little impact on the matter density profile. Adopting the
above sigma/V_vir ratio, the observed relationships between photometric and
dynamical properties which define the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies,
such as the luminosity-sigma (Faber-Jackson) and the luminosity-effective
radius relations, as well as the M_BH-sigma relation, are nicely reproduced.
Their shapes turn out to be determined by the mutual feedback of star-formation
(and supernova explosions)and nuclear activity, along the lines discussed by
Granato et al. (2004). To our knowledge, this is the first semi-analytic model
for which simultaneous fits of the fundamental plane relations and of the
epoch-dependent luminosity function of spheroidal galaxies have been presented.",2005-04-27T14:41:51Z
Further spectroscopic observations of the CSL-1 object,"CSL-1 is a peculiar object (R.A._{2000}= 12h 23m 30.5""; Dec_{2000}= -12deg
38' 57.0"") which, for its photometric and spectroscopic properties, is possibly
the first case of gravitational lensing by a cosmic string. In this paper we
present additional evidences, based on medium-high resolution VLT + FORS1
observations, that the spectra of the two components of CSL-1 are identical
within a confidence level higher than 99.9% and the velocity difference of the
two components is consistent with zero. This result adds further confidence to
the interpretation of the system as a true lens.",2005-06-17T00:37:15Z
Weak Gravitational Flexion,"Flexion is the significant third-order weak gravitational lensing effect
responsible for the weakly skewed and arc-like appearance of lensed galaxies.
Here we demonstrate how flexion measurements can be used to measure galaxy halo
density profiles and large-scale structure on non-linear scales, via
galaxy-galaxy lensing, dark matter mapping and cosmic flexion correlation
functions. We describe the origin of gravitational flexion, and discuss its
four components, two of which are first described here. We also introduce an
efficient complex formalism for all orders of lensing distortion. We proceed to
examine the flexion predictions for galaxy-galaxy lensing, examining isothermal
sphere and Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) profiles and both circularly symmetric
and elliptical cases. We show that in combination with shear we can precisely
measure galaxy masses and NFW halo concentrations. We also show how flexion
measurements can be used to reconstruct mass maps in 2-D projection on the sky,
and in 3-D in combination with redshift data. Finally, we examine the
predictions for cosmic flexion, including convergence-flexion
cross-correlations, and find that the signal is an effective probe of structure
on non-linear scales.",2005-04-21T17:45:50Z
"Probing the Spatial Distribution of the Interstellar Dust Medium by High
  Angular Resolution X-ray Halos of Point Sources","We studied the X-ray dust scattering halos around 17 bright X-ray point
sources using {\it Chandra} data. We use an iterative method to resolve the
halos at small scattering angles from the zeroth order data in CC-mode or the
first order data in TE-mode which is not or less piled-up. Using the halo
models of Weingartner $&$ Draine (2001, WD01) and Mathis, Rumpl $&$ Nordsieck
(1977, MRN) to fit the halo profiles, we get the hydrogen column densities and
the spatial distributions of the scattering dust grains along the line of
sights (LOS) to these sources. We find that the scattering dust density very
close to these sources is much higher than the normal interstellar medium. For
X-ray pulsars GX 301-2 and Vela X-1 with companions of strong stellar winds,
the X-ray absorption column densities are much higher than the derived
scattering column densities, because of the dense media around the X-ray
sources produce extremely small angle scatterings which are indistinguishable
from the point sources even with \textit{Chandra}'s angular resolution. For LMC
X-1, most of the scattering and absorption occur in Large Magellanic Cloud,
rather than in the Milky Way. From the obtained X-rays spectra, the cold gas
absorption and thus the quivalent hydrogen column is determined. We have
obtained the linear correlation between $N_{H}$ derived from spectral fits and
the one derived from the halo model WD01 and MRN (except for GX 301-2 and Vela
X-1): $N_{H,WD01} = (0.720\pm0.009) \times N_{H,abs} + (0.051\pm0.013)$ and
$N_{N, MRN} = (1.156\pm0.016) \times N_{H,abs} + (0.062\pm0.024)$ in the units
$10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. High angular resolution X-ray dust scattering halos offer
an excellent potential for probing the spatial distributions of interstellar
dust medium.",2005-03-11T11:15:03Z
"The CFHT Legacy Survey: The Morphology-Density Relation of Galaxies out
  to Z~1","We study the relationships between galaxy total luminosity (M_g), morphology,
color and environment as a function of redshift. We use a magnitude-limited
sample of 65,624 galaxies in the redshift range 0<z<1.3 taken from one of the
Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey Deep Fields. We parametrize galaxy
morphology according to the Sersic index n. Our n>2 number fractions at z=0.1
agree well with those based on SDSS galaxies. We find that the n>2 galaxy
number fraction is constant with redshift in the field. However, for overdense
environments this fraction is larger and increases towards lower redshifts,
higher densities and higher luminosities. Rest-frame color-magnitude diagrams
show that the color distribution is bimodal out to our redshift limit of z~1
with a prominent red-sequence of galaxies at 0.2<z<0.4 and a large blue-peak
dominance at 0.8<z<1. We use this bimodality to define a red galaxy fraction
(rest-frame u-g>1). For all environments, this fraction increases towards lower
redshifts and higher luminosities. The red fraction within cluster-like regions
changes 60% faster with redshift as compared to the field for M_g<-19.5. Using,
for the first time, observations across many cluster-field interfaces
distributed over a single, large volume, we trace the large-scale
morphology-density relation and the Butcher-Oemler effect over a period of
almost 8 Gyr.",2005-05-06T12:17:24Z
"Optimal column density measurements from multiband near-infrared
  observations","We consider from a general point of view the problem of determining the
extinction in dense molecular clouds. We use a rigorous statistical approach to
characterize the properties of the most widely used optical and infrared
techniques, namely the star count and the color excess methods. We propose a
new maximum-likelihood method that takes advantage of both star counts and star
colors to provide an optimal estimate of the extinction. Detailed numerical
simulations show that our method performs optimally under a wide range of
conditions and, in particular, is significantly superior to the standard
techniques for clouds with high column-densities and affected by contamination
by foreground stars.",2005-04-14T11:58:51Z
Radial Velocities of Newly Discovered Globular Clusters in NGC 5128,"We present radial velocity measurements for 74 globular clusters (GCs) in the
nearby giant elliptical NGC 5128, of which 31 are newly discovered clusters.
All the GC candidates were taken from the list of possible new clusters given
in the Harris, Harris, & Geisler (2004) photometric survey. In addition to the
newly confirmed clusters, we identified 24 definite foreground stars and 31
probable background galaxies. From a combined list of 299 known GCs in NGC 5128
with measured radial velocities and metallicity-sensitive (C - T_1) photometric
indices, we construct a new metallicity distribution function (MDF) for the
cluster system. The MDF shows an approximately bimodal form, with centroids at
[Fe/H] = -1.46 and -0.53, and with nearly equal numbers of metal-poor and
metal-rich clusters in the two modes. However, there are many
intermediate-color clusters in the distribution, and the fainter clusters tend
to have a higher proportion of red clusters. These features of the MDF may
indicate a widespread age range within the cluster system as well as an
intrinsically broad metallicity spread.",2005-03-07T19:29:25Z
"A high sensitivity HI survey of the sky at delta < -25 deg Final data
  release","We present the final data release of the high sensitivity lambda 21-cm
neutral hydrogen survey of the sky south of delta < -25 degr. A total of 50980
positions lying on a galactic coordinate grid with points spaced by (Delta l,
Delta b) = ((0.5 deg)/cos b, 0.5 deg) were observed with the 30-m dish of the
Instituto Argentino de Radioastronomia (IAR). The angular resolution of the
survey is HPBW = 0.5 deg and the velocity coverage spans the interval -450 km/s

radiation and converted to brightness temperatures.",2005-04-06T08:31:00Z
Interacting Phantom Energy and Avoidance of the Big Rip Singularity,"Models of the universe with arbitrary (non gravitational) interaction between
the components of the cosmic fluid: the phantom energy and the background, are
investigated. A general form of the interaction that is inspired in
scalar-tensor theories of gravity is considered. No specific model for the
phantom fluid is assumed. We concentrate our investigation on solutions that
are free of the coincidence problem. We found a wide region in the parameter
space where the solutions are free of the big rip singularity also. Physical
arguments, together with arguments based on the analysis of the observational
evidence, suggest that phantom models without big rip singularity might be
preferred by Nature.",2005-02-07T16:08:13Z
"An empirical formula for the mass-loss rates of dust-enshrouded red
  supergiants and oxygen-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch stars","We present an empirical determination of the mass-loss rate as a function of
stellar luminosity and effective temperature, for oxygen-rich dust-enshrouded
Asymptotic Giant Branch stars and red supergiants. To this aim we obtained
optical spectra of a sample of dust-enshrouded red giants in the Large
Magellanic Cloud, which we complemented with spectroscopic and infrared
photometric data from the literature. Two of these turned out to be hot
emission-line stars, of which one is a definite B[e] star. The mass-loss rates
were measured through modelling of the spectral energy distributions. We thus
obtain the mass-loss rate formula log Mdot = -5.65 + 1.05 log(L / 10,000 Lsun)
-6.3 log(Teff / 3500 K), valid for dust-enshrouded red supergiants and
oxygen-rich AGB stars. Despite the low metallicity of the LMC, both AGB stars
and red supergiants are found at late spectral types. A comparison with
galactic AGB stars and red supergiants shows excellent agreement between the
mass-loss rate as predicted by our formula and that derived from the 60 micron
flux density for dust-enshrouded objects, but not for optically bright objects.
We discuss the possible implications of this for the mass-loss mechanism.",2005-04-18T09:35:51Z
V4140 Sgr: a short period dwarf nova with a peculiar behavior,"We report on time series of CCD photometry of V4140 Sgr between 1991 and
2001. The analysis reveals that the object was in the decline from an outburst
in 1992 and again in outburst in 2001. The historical light curve collected by
amateur astronomers shows low amplitude (1-2 mag) outbursts 5-10 days long,
recurrent every 80-90 days, confirming its dwarf nova nature. We derive an
outburst decline time scale of 1.2 days mag$^{-1}$. Eclipse mapping techniques
were applied to data both in quiescence and in outburst to derive accretion
disc surface brightness maps. A distance of $d = 170 \pm 30$ pc is obtained
from a method similar to that used to constrain the distance to open clusters.
  From this distance, disc radial brightness temperature distributions are
determined. The temperatures in the quiescent disc vary from $6 000$ K in the
inner regions to $3 000$ K near the outer disc and are flatter than the $T
\propto r^{-{3/4}}$ law for optically thick steady-state disc. The outburst
occurs mainly with a significant increase in brightness of the intermediate and
outer disc regions. The disc temperatures remain below the critical effective
temperature $T_{\rm crit}$ at all disc radii during outburst. The radial
temperature distributions in quiescence and in outburst are significantly
different from those of other dwarf novae of similar orbital period. These
results cannot be explained within the framework of the disc instability model.
We suggest that the small amplitude outbursts of V4140 Sgr are caused by bursts
of enhanced mass transfer rate from the secondary star.",2005-03-22T20:31:33Z
"Magnetic Fields, Accretion, and the Central Engine of Gamma-Ray Bursts","I briefly review magnetic effects in accretion physics, and then go on to
discuss a possible central engine for gamma-ray bursts. A rotating black hole
immersed in a non-axisymmetric magnetic field experiences a torque trying to
align spin and field. I suggest that gamma-ray burst hosts may provide
conditions where this effect allows rapid extraction of a significant fraction
of the hole's rotational energy. I argue that much of the electromagnetic
emission is in two narrow beams parallel and antiparallel to the asymptotic
field direction. This picture suggests that only a mass 10^-5 Msun is expelled
in a relativistic outflow, as required by the fireball picture.",2005-02-28T12:12:22Z
Gravoturbulent formation of planetesimals,"We explore the effect of magnetorotational turbulence on the dynamics and
concentrations of boulders in local box simulations of a sub-Keplerian
protoplanetary disc. The solids are treated as particles each with an
independent space coordinate and velocity. We find that the turbulence has two
effects on the solids. 1) Meter and decameter bodies are strongly concentrated,
locally up to a factor 100 times the average dust density, whereas decimeter
bodies only experience a moderate density increase. The concentrations are
located in large scale radial gas density enhancements that arise from a
combination of turbulence and shear. 2) For meter-sized boulders, the
concentrations cause the average radial drift speed to be reduced by 40%. We
find that the densest clumps of solids are gravitationally unstable under
physically reasonable values for the gas column density and for the dust-to-gas
ratio due to sedimentation. We speculate that planetesimals can form in a dust
layer that is not in itself dense enough to undergo gravitational
fragmentation, and that fragmentation happens in turbulent density fluctuations
in this sublayer.",2005-04-28T09:55:18Z
"How Concentrated Are The Haloes Of Low Surface Brightness Galaxies In
  The Cold Dark Matter Model?","We investigate whether a correlation exists between the concentration and
spin parameters of dark matter haloes forming in LCDM N-body simulations. In
particular, we focus on haloes with virial masses characteristic of the hosts
of Low Surface Brightness (LSB) and High Surface Brightness (HSB) galaxies. Our
analysis demonstrates that concentration and spin are anti-correlated. If we
assume that a galaxy disk forms in one of these haloes from baryons that
approximately conserved angular momentum during their dissipation into the
rotationally supported disk, then it is possible to estimate the disk's central
surface density. For an appropriate choice of mass-to-light ratio, we can place
constraints on the central surface brightness of the disk and hence identify
the analogues of the host haloes of LSB and HSB galaxies. We find that our LSB
galaxy analogues occupy haloes that have lower concentrations than might be
expected based on consideration of the mass-concentration relation for the LCDM
cosmology. The distribution of concentrations peaks at c~6, in good agreement
with observational data, although there are important differences between the
shapes of the simulated and observationally inferred distributions. This
suggests that LSB galaxies inhabit a biased subsample of the halo population,
and that this bias may be an important ingredient for resolving the current
debate regarding the structure of LSB galaxy dark matter haloes.",2005-02-11T00:46:18Z
"A Variable Infrared Counterpart to the Soft Gamma-ray Repeater SGR
  1806-20","We present K'-band (2.12 micron) imaging observations of the SGR 1806-20
field taken during its very active phase in mid 2004, which reveal brightening
of sources within the Chandra X-ray error circle when compared with earlier
images obtained in 2002. One source brightened by more than a factor of 2, and
so we consider this to be the probable infrared counterpart for SGR 1806-20.
The other two sources are located in close proximity to the probable
counterpart and show marginal brightening, which may suggest that the
high-energy photons emitted from the SGR during its active phase have induced
dust sublimation or brightening of the unresolved background around the SGR.",2005-03-11T22:22:50Z
"A Log-Quadratic Relation Between the Nuclear Black-Hole Masses and
  Velocity Dispersions of Galaxies","We demonstrate that a log-linear relation does not provide an adequate
description of the correlation between the masses of Super-Massive Black-Holes
(SMBH, M_bh) and the velocity dispersions of their host spheroid (sigma). An
unknown relation between log(M_bh) and log(sigma) may be expanded to second
order to obtain a log-quadratic relation of the form log(M_bh)=alpha+beta
log(sigma/200) + beta_2[log(sigma/200)]^2. We perform a Bayesian analysis using
the Nuker sample, and solve for beta, beta_2 and alpha, in addition to the
intrinsic scatter (delta). We find unbiased parameter estimates of
beta=4.2+/-0.37, beta_2=1.6+/-1.3 and delta=0.275+/-0.05. At the 80% level the
M_bh-sigma relation does not follow a uniform power-law. Indeed, over the
velocity range 70km/s<sigma<380km/s the logarithmic slope of the best fit
relation varies between 2.7 and 5.1, which should be compared with a power-law
estimate of 4.02+/-0.33. Assuming no systematic offset, single epoch virial
SMBH masses estimated for AGN follow the same log-quadratic M_bh-sigma relation
as the Nuker sample, but extend it downward in mass by an order of magnitude.
The log-quadratic term in the M_bh-sigma relation has a significant effect on
estimates of the local SMBH mass function at M_bh>10^9 solar masses, leading to
densities of SMBHs with M_bh>10^10 solar masses that are several orders of
magnitude larger than inferred from a log-linear relation. We also estimate
unbiased parameters for the SMBH-bulge mass relation. With a parameterisation
log(M_bh)=alpha_b + beta_b log(M_b/10^{11}) + beta_2b[log(M_b/10^{11})]^2, we
find beta_b=1.15+/-0.18 and beta_2b=0.12+/-0.14. We determined an intrinsic
scatter delta_b=0.41+/-0.07 which is ~50% larger than the scatter in the
M_bh-sigma relation.",2005-03-21T03:00:47Z
Do Black Holes Produce Phantom Energy?,"We conjecture that black holes, whether accreting matter or not, can also
lose mass to phantom energy production. Such a process can be made plausible in
theories that allow for non-local connections between short and long wavelength
modes. If true, observational data should show an exchange of energy from
matter to phantom at some cosmic epoch, and we discuss a simple model. Some
remarks on an appropriate quantum gravity theory and related issues are also
presented.",2005-03-15T19:16:33Z
Determination of Cepheid parameters by light-curve template-fitting,"We describe techniques to characterise the light-curves of regular variable
stars by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to a training set of high
quality data, and to fit the resulting light-curve templates to sparse and
noisy photometry to obtain parameters such as periods, mean magnitudes etc. The
PCA approach allows us to efficiently represent the multi-band light-curve
shapes of each variable, and hence quantitatively describe the average
behaviour of the sample as a smoothly varying function of period, and also the
range of variation around this average.
  In this paper we focus particularly on the utility of such methods for
analysing HST Cepheid photometry, and present simulations which illustrate the
advantages of our PCA template-fitting approach. These are: accurate parameter
determination, including light-curve shape information; simultaneous fitting to
multiple passbands; quantitative error analysis; objective rejection of
variables with non Cepheid-like light-curves or those with potential period
aliases.
  We also use PCA to confirm that Cepheid light-curve shapes are systematically
different (at the same period) between the Milky Way (MW) and the Large and
Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC, SMC), and consider whether light-curve shape
might therefore be used to estimate the mean metallicities of Cepheid samples,
thus allowing metallicity corrections to be applied to derived distance
estimates.",2005-04-19T07:24:42Z
"X-Ray Emission and Optical Polarization of V1432 Aquilae: An
  Asynchronous Polar","A detailed analysis of X-ray data from ROSAT, ASCA, XMM and RXTE for the
asynchronous polar V1432 Aql along with Stokes polarimetry data from SAAO, is
presented. Power spectra from long-baseline ROSAT data show a spin period of
12150s along with several system related frequency components. However, the
second harmonic of the spin period dominates power spectrum in the XMM data.
For the optical circular polarization, the dominant period corresponds to half
the spin period. The ROSAT data can be explained as due to accretion onto two
hot spots that are not anti-podal. The variations seen in the optical
polarization and the ASCA and XMM data suggest the presence of at least three
accretion foot prints on the white dwarf surface. Two spectral models, a
multi-temperature plasma and a photo-ionized plasma model, are used for
spectral study. The RXTE PCA data are used to constrain the white dwarf mass to
1.2$\pm$0.1 M_odot using the multi-temperature plasma model. A strong soft
X-ray excess (<0.8 keV) in the XMM MOS data is well modeled by a blackbody
component having a temperature of 80-90 eV. The plasma emission lines seen at
6.7 and 7.0 keV are well fitted using the multi-temperature plasma model,
however an additional Gaussian is needed for the 6.4 keV line. The
multi-temperature plasma model requires a homogeneous absorber fully covering
the source and a partial absorber covering 65% of the source. The photo-ionized
plasma model, with a range of Fe column densities, gives a slightly better
overall fit and fits all emission lines. The presence of a strong blackbody
component, a spin period of 12150s, modulation of the 6.4 keV line flux with
spin period, and a very hard X-ray component suggest that V1432 Aql is a polar
with X-ray spectral properties similar to that of a soft intermediate polar.",2005-05-12T07:40:51Z
Detection of point sources on two-dimensional images based on peaks,"This article considers the detection of point sources in two dimensional
astronomical images. The detection scheme we propose is based on peak
statistics. We discuss the example of the detection of far galaxies in Cosmic
Microwave Background experiments throughout the paper, although the method we
present is totally general and can be used in many other fields of data
analysis. We assume sources with a Gaussian profile --that is a fair
approximation of the profile of a point source convolved with the detector beam
in microwave experiments-- on a background modeled by a homogeneous and
isotropic Gaussian random field characterized by a scale-free power spectrum.
Point sources are enhanced with respect to the background by means of linear
filters. After filtering, we identify local maxima and apply our detection
scheme, a Neyman-Pearson detector that defines our region of acceptance based
on the a priori pdf of the sources and the ratio of number densities. We study
the different performances of some linear filters that have been used in this
context in the literature: the Mexican Hat wavelet, the matched filter and the
scale-adaptive filter. We consider as well an extension to two dimensions of
the biparametric scale adaptive filter (BSAF). The BSAF depends on two
parameters which are determined by maximizing the number density of real
detections while fixing the number density of spurious detections. For our
detection criterion the BSAF outperforms the other filters in the interesting
case of white noise.",2005-03-07T15:20:34Z
"Virtual Astronomy, Information Technology, and the New Scientific
  Methodology","All sciences, including astronomy, are now entering the era of information
abundance. The exponentially increasing volume and complexity of modern data
sets promises to transform the scientific practice, but also poses a number of
common technological challenges. The Virtual Observatory concept is the
astronomical community's response to these challenges: it aims to harness the
progress in information technology in the service of astronomy, and at the same
time provide a valuable testbed for information technology and applied computer
science. Challenges broadly fall into two categories: data handling (or ""data
farming""), including issues such as archives, intelligent storage, databases,
interoperability, fast networks, etc., and data mining, data understanding, and
knowledge discovery, which include issues such as automated clustering and
classification, multivariate correlation searches, pattern recognition,
visualization in highly hyperdimensional parameter spaces, etc., as well as
various applications of machine learning in these contexts. Such techniques are
forming a methodological foundation for science with massive and complex data
sets in general, and are likely to have a much broather impact on the modern
society, commerce, information economy, security, etc. There is a powerful
emerging synergy between the computationally enabled science and the
science-driven computing, which will drive the progress in science,
scholarship, and many other venues in the 21st century.",2005-04-28T23:49:55Z
Detection of Thermal Emission from an Extrasolar Planet,"We present Spitzer Space Telescope infrared photometric time series of the
transiting extrasolar planet system TrES-1. The data span a predicted time of
secondary eclipse, corresponding to the passage of the planet behind the star.
In both bands of our observations, we detect a flux decrement with a timing,
amplitude, and duration as predicted by published parameters of the system.
This signal represents the first direct detection of (i.e. the observation of
photons emitted by) a planet orbiting another star. The observed eclipse depths
(in units of relative flux) are 0.00066 +/- 0.00013 at 4.5um and 0.00225 +/-
0.00036 at 8.0um. These estimates provide the first observational constraints
on models of the thermal emission of hot Jupiters. Assuming that the planet
emits as a blackbody, we estimate an effective temperature of T_p=1060 +/- 50
K. Under the additional assumptions that the planet is in thermal equilibrium
with the radiation from the star and emits isotropically, we find a Bond albedo
of A = 0.31 +/- 0.14. This would imply that the planet absorbs the majority of
stellar radiation incident upon it, a conclusion of significant impact to
atmospheric models of these objects. We compare our data to a
previously-published model of the planetary thermal emission, which predicts
prominent spectral features in our observational bands due to water and carbon
monoxide. Based on the time of secondary eclipse, we present an upper limit on
the orbital eccentricity that is sufficiently small that we conclude that tidal
dissipation is unlikely to provide a significant source of energy interior to
the planet.(abridged)",2005-03-21T21:33:12Z
On the binary nature of 1RXS J162848.1-415241,"We present spectroscopy of the optical counterpart to 1RXS J162848.1-41524,
also known as the microquasar candidate MCQC J162847-4152. All the data
indicate that this X-ray source is not a microquasar, and that it is a
single-lined chromospherically active binary system with a likely orbital
period of 4.9 days. Our analysis supports a K3IV spectral classification for
the star, which is dominant at optical wavelengths. The unseen binary component
is most likely a late-type (K7-M) dwarf or a white dwarf. Using the high
resolution spectra we have measured the K3 star's rotational broadening to be
vsini = 43 +/- 3 km/s and determined a lower limit to the binary mass ratio of
q(=M2/M1)>2.0. The high rotational broadening together with the strong CaII H &
K / Halpha emission and high-amplitude photometric variations indicate that the
evolved star is very chromospherically active and responsible for the
X-ray/radio emission.",2005-06-15T23:59:24Z
Asphericity and clumpiness in the winds of Luminous Blue Variables,"We present the first systematic spectropolarimetric study of Luminous Blue
Variables (LBVs) in the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds, in order to
investigate the geometries of their winds. We find that at least half of our
sample show changes in polarization across the strong H$\alpha$ emission line,
indicating that the light from the stars is intrinsically polarized and
therefore that asphericity already exists at the base of the wind. Multi-epoch
spectropolarimetry on four targets reveals variability in their intrinsic
polarization. Three of these, AG Car, HR Car and P Cyg, show a position angle
(PA) of polarization which appears random with time. Such behaviour can be
explained by the presence of strong wind-inhomogeneities, or `clumps' within
the wind. Only one star, R 127, shows variability at a constant PA, and hence
evidence for axi-symmetry as well as clumpiness. However, if viewed at low
inclination, and at limited temporal sampling, such a wind would produce a
seemingly random polarization of the type observed in the other three stars.
Time-resolved spectropolarimetric monitoring of LBVs is therefore required to
determine if LBV winds are axi-symmetric in general.
  The high fraction of LBVs ($>$ 50%) showing intrinsic polarization is to be
compared with the lower $\sim$ 20-25 % for similar studies of their
evolutionary neighbours, O supergiants and Wolf-Rayet stars. We anticipate that
this higher incidence is due to the lower effective gravities of the LBVs,
coupled with their variable temperatures within the bi-stability jump regime.
This is also consistent with the higher incidence of wind asphericity that we
find in LBVs with strong H$\alpha$ emission and recent (last $\sim$ 10 years)
strong variability.",2005-05-17T12:22:14Z

Spot the differences: The X-ray spectrum of SU Aur compared to TW Hya,"We present high-resolution Chandra HETGS X-ray spectra of the classical T
Tauri star SU Aur. The quiescent X-ray emission is dominated by a 20-40 MK
plasma, which contrasts strongly with the cool 3 MK plasma dominating the X-ray
emission of the CTTS TW Hya. A large flare occurred during the first half of
our 100 ks observation, and we have modelled the emitting plasma both during
this flare and during the apparently quiescent periods. During the flare, an
extremely high temperature plasma component (at least 60 MK) accounts for the
bulk of the emission. There is an indication of the presence of Fe XXVI
emission at 1.78 Angstrom, which is maximally formed at 130 MK.",2005-04-25T23:07:20Z
Afterglow Observations Shed New Light on the Nature of X-ray Flashes,"X-ray flashes (XRFs) and X-ray rich gamma-ray bursts (XRGRBs) share many
observational characteristics with long duration GRBs, but the reason for which
their prompt emission peaks at lower photon energies, $E_p$, is still under
debate. Although many different models have been invoked in order to explain
the lower $E_p$ values, their implications for the afterglow emission were not
considered in most cases, mainly because observations of XRF afterglows have
become available only recently. Here we examine the predictions of the various
XRF models for the afterglow emission, and test them against the observations
of XRF 030723 and XRGRB 041006, the events with the best monitored afterglow
light curves in their respective class. We show that most existing XRF models
are hard to reconcile with the observed afterglow light curves, which are very
flat at early times. Such light curves are, however, naturally produced by a
roughly uniform jet with relatively sharp edges that is viewed off-axis (i.e.
from outside of the jet aperture). This type of model self consistently
accommodates both the observed prompt emission and the afterglow light curves
of XRGRB 041006 and XRF 030723, implying viewing angles $\theta_{obs}$ from the
jet axis of $(\theta_{obs}-\theta_0)\sim 0.15\theta_0$ and $\sim \theta_0$,
respectively, where $\theta_0\sim 3$ deg is the jet half-opening angle. This
suggests that GRBs, XRGRBs and XRFs are intrinsically similar relativistic jets
viewed from different angles, corresponding to $\gamma(\theta_{obs}-\theta_0)$
of less than 1, between 1 and a few, and more than a few, respectively, where
$\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor. Future observations with Swift could help test
this unification scheme in which GRBs, XRGRBs and XRFs share the same basic
physics and differ only by their orientation relative to our line of sight.",2005-02-16T00:20:46Z
"The IMF in Extreme Star-Forming Environments: Searching for Variations
  vs. Initial Conditions","Any predictive theory of star formation must explain observed variations (or
lack thereof) in the initial mass function. Recent work suggests that we might
expect quantitative variations in the IMF as a function of metallicity (Larson
2005) or magnetic field strength (Shu et al. 2004). We summarize results from
several on-going studies attempting to constrain the ratio of high to low mass
stars, as well as stars to sub- stellar objects, in a variety of different
environments, all containing high mass stars.
  First, we examine the ratio of stars to sub--stellar objects in the nearby
Mon R2 region utilizing NICMOS/HST data. We compare our results to the IMF by
Kroupa (2002)]} and to the observed ratios for IC 348 and Orion. Second, we
present preliminary results for the ratio of high to low mass stars in W51, the
most luminous HII region in the galaxy. Based on ground--based multi--colour
images of the cluster obtained with the MMT adaptive optics system, we derive a
lower limit to the ratio of high-mass to low-mass stars and compare it to the
ratios for nearby clusters.
  Finally, we present the derived IMF for the R136 region in the LMC where the
metallicity is 1/4 solar using HST/NICMOS data. We find that the IMF is
consistent with that characterizing the field (Chabrier 2003), as well as
nearby star--forming regions, down to 1.0 Msun outside 2 pc. Whereas the
results for both Mon R2 and R136 are consistent with the nearby clusters, the
ratio of high to low mass stars in W51 tentatively indicates a lack of
low--mass objects.",2005-06-14T21:12:10Z
"The Blackholic energy: long and short Gamma-Ray Bursts (New perspectives
  in physics and astrophysics from the theoretical understanding of Gamma-Ray
  Bursts, II)","[...] We turn then to the theoretical developments in the short GRBs: we
first report some progress in the understanding the dynamical phase of
collapse, the mass-energy formula and the extraction of blackholic energy which
have been motivated by the analysis of the short GRBs. In this context progress
has also been accomplished on establishing an absolute lower limit to the
irreducible mass of the black hole as well as on some critical considerations
about the relations of general relativity and the second law of thermodynamics.
We recall how this last issue has been one of the most debated in theoretical
physics in the past thirty years due to the work of Bekenstein and Hawking.
Following these conceptual progresses we analyze the vacuum polarization
process around an overcritical collapsing shell. We evidence the existence of a
separatrix and a dyadosphere trapping surface in the dynamics of the
electron-positron plasma generated during the process of gravitational
collapse. We then analyze, using recent progress in the solution of the
Vlasov-Boltzmann-Maxwell system, the oscillation regime in the created
electron-positron plasma and their rapid convergence to a thermalized spectrum.
We conclude by making precise predictions for the spectra, the energy fluxes
and characteristic time-scales of the radiation for short-bursts. If the
precise luminosity variation and spectral hardening of the radiation we have
predicted will be confirmed by observations of short-bursts, these systems will
play a major role as standard candles in cosmology. These considerations will
also be relevant for the analysis of the long-bursts when the baryonic matter
contribution will be taken into account.",2005-03-22T20:21:09Z
High-Energy Cosmic Rays and Neutrinos from Gamma-Ray Bursts,"A complete model for the origin of high-energy >~10^{14} eV) cosmic rays from
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and implications of this hypothesis are described.
Detection of high-energy neutrinos from GRBs provide an unambiguous test of the
model. Evidence for cosmic-ray acceleration in GRBs is suggested by the
detection of anomalous gamma-ray components such as that observed from GRB
941017. Neutron beta-decay halos around star-forming galaxies such as the Milky
Way are formed as a consequence of this model. Cosmic rays from GRBs in the
Galaxy are unlikely to account for the ~10^{18} eV cosmic-ray excess reported
by the Sydney University Giant Air Shower Recorder (SUGAR), but could
contribute to past extinction events.",2005-06-16T17:37:03Z
Scintillation Response of Liquid Xenon to Low Energy Nuclear Recoils,"Liquid Xenon (LXe) is expected to be an excellent target and detector medium
to search for dark matter in the form of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles
(WIMPs). Knowledge of LXe ionization and scintillation response to low energy
nuclear recoils expected from the scattering of WIMPs by Xe nuclei is important
for determining the sensitivity of LXe direct detection experiments. Here we
report on new measurements of the scintillation yield of Xe recoils with
kinetic energy as low as 10 keV. The dependence of the scintillation yield on
applied electric field was also measured in the range of 0 to 4 kV/cm. Results
are in good agreement with recent theoretical predictions that take into
account the effect of biexcitonic collisions in addition to the nuclear
quenching effect.",2005-03-29T14:38:34Z
"Outflowing disk formation in B[e] supergiants due to rotation and
  bi--stability in radiation driven winds","The effects of rapid rotation and bi-stability upon the density contrast
between the equatorial and polar directions of a B[e] supergiant are
re-investigated. Based upon a new slow solution for different high rotational
radiation driven winds (Cur\'e 2004) and the fact that bi--stability allows a
change in the line--force parameters ($\alpha$, $k$, and $\delta$), the
equatorial densities are about $10^2$--$10^4$ times higher than the polar ones.
These values are in qualitative agreement with the observations.",2005-03-16T17:36:28Z
"Multiple sources or late injection of short-lived r-nuclides in the
  early solar system?","Comparisons between the predicted abundances of short-lived r-nuclides
(107Pd, 129I, 182Hf, and 244Pu) in the interstellar medium (ISM) and the
observed abundances in the early solar system (ESS) conclusively showed that
these nuclides cannot simply be derived from galactic chemical evolution (GCE)
if synthesized in a unique stellar environment. It was thus suggested that two
di erent types of stars were responsible for the production of light and heavy
r-nuclides. Here, new constraints on the 244Pu=238U production ratio are used
in an open nonlinear GCE model. It is shown that the two r-process scenario
cannot explain the low abundance of 244Pu in the ESS and that this requires
either than actinides be produced at an additional site (A-events) or more
likely, that 129I and 244Pu be inherited from GCE and 107Pd and 182Hf be
injected in the ESS by the explosion of a nearby supernova.",2005-02-24T17:26:39Z
"Late-time X-Ray, UV and Optical Monitoring of Supernova 1979C","We present results from observations of SN 1979C with XMM-Newton in X-rays
and in the UV, archival X-ray and HST data, and follow-up ground-based optical
imaging. The XMM-Newton MOS spectrum shows two-temperature thermal plasma
emission characteristics of both the forward (4.1 keV) and reverse shock (0.78
keV) with no intrinsic absorption. The long-term X-ray lightcurve of SN 1979C
shows no sign of a decline over 16-23 yrs after its outburst. The high X-ray
luminosity (8 x 10^38 ergs/s) is caused by the interaction of the shock with
dense circumstellar matter, likely deposited by a strong stellar wind from the
progenitor with a high mass-loss rate of 1.5 x 10^-4 M_sun/yr. The X-ray data
support a strongly decelerated shock and show a mass-loss rate history which is
consistent with a constant progenitor mass-loss rate and wind velocity over the
past >16,000 yrs in the evolution of the progenitor. We find a CSM density
profile of rho_CSM \propto r^-s with index s<1.7 and high CSM densities (>10^4
cm^-3) out to large radii from the site of the explosion (> 4 x 10^17 cm).
Using XMM-Newton Optical Monitor data we further detect optical/UV emission
from SN 1979C, with B, U, and UVW1-band lum. of 5,7, and 9 x 10^36 ergs/s. The
young stellar cluster in the vicinity of the SN, as imaged by the HST and
follow-up ground-based optical imaging, can only provide a fraction of the
total observed flux, so that a significant contribution to the output likely
arises from the strong interaction of SN 1979C with dense CSM.",2005-03-30T21:21:41Z
Type Ia supernova diversity in three-dimensional models,"The use of type Ia supernovae as distance indicators for cosmology has
initiated a search for theoretical arguments supporting the empirical
calibration methods applied. To this end, as a first step, a sound
understanding of the origin of the observed diversity in type Ia supernova
properties is needed. Here we present a first systematic study of effects
resulting from changing some physical parameters of three-dimensional
deflagration models of thermonuclear supernovae. In our study we vary the
progenitor's carbon-to-oxygen ratio and its central density prior to ignition
because both properties are not well determined by stellar evolution theory and
they may change from supernova to supernova. Next we compute for these
explosion models the nucleosynthesis yields in a post-processing step. This, in
addition, allows us to study variations in the progenitor's metallicity by
means of different $^{22}$Ne mass fractions in the initial composition. We find
that the progenitor's carbon-to-oxygen ratio and its central density affect the
energy release of the models and thus the expansion velocity of the supernova.
Moreover, we find that changing the metallicity and the central density changes
the production of radioactive $^{56}$Ni and thus affects the luminosity. In
contrast, the carbon-to-oxygen ratio has little effect on the $^{56}$Ni
production. Implications of the found variations of the explosion energy and
the produced $^{56}$Ni mass for the type Ia supernova diversity are discussed.",2005-06-06T11:12:58Z
"NGC 146: A young open cluster with a Herbig Be star and intermediate
  mass pre-main sequence stars","We present UBV CCD photometry and low-resolution spectra of stars in the
field of the young open cluster NGC 146. UBV photometry of 434 stars were used
to estimate the E(B$-$V) reddening of 0.55 $\pm$ 0.04 mag and BV photometry of
976 stars were used to estimate a distance modulus of (m$-$M)$_0$ = 12.7
$\pm$0.2 mag, corresponding to a distance of 3470$^{+335}_{-305}$ pc. We
estimated 10 -- 16 Myr as the turn-off age for the upper main sequence of the
cluster using isochrones and synthetic colour magnitude diagrams. We identified
two B type stars with H$_\alpha$ in emission and located on the MS using
slit-less spectra. A higher resolution spectrum of the brighter Be star
indicated the presence of a number of emission lines, with some lines showing
the signature of gas infall. This star was found to be located in the region of
Herbig Ae/Be stars in the (J$-$H) vs (H$-$K) colour-colour diagram. Thus, we
identify this star as a Herbig Be star. On the other hand, 54 stars were found
to show near infrared excess, of which 17 were found to be located in the
region of Herbig Ae/Be stars and 18 stars were found to be located in the
region of Be stars in the NIR colour-colour diagram. Thus NGC 146 is a young
cluster with a large number of intermediate mass pre-main sequence stars. The
turn-on age of the cluster is found to be $\sim$ 3 Myr. Though NGC 146 shows an
older turn off, the bulk of stars in this cluster seems to belong to the
younger population of 3 Myr.",2005-05-16T04:36:07Z
"A fresh look at the unstable simulations of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton
  accretion","The instability of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion, observed in numerical
simulations, is analyzed through known physical mechanisms and possible
numerical artefacts. The mechanisms of the longitudinal and transverse
instabilities, established within the accretion line model, are clarified. They
cannot account for the instability of BHL accretion at moderate Mach number
when the pressure forces within the shock cone are taken into account. The
advective-acoustic instability is considered in the context of BHL accretion
when the shock is detached from the accretor. This mechanism naturally explains
the stability of the flow when the shock is weak, and the instability when the
accretor is small. In particular, it is a robust proof of the instability of 3D
accretion when gamma=5/3 if the accretor is small enough, even for moderate
shock strength (M sim 3). The numerical artefacts that may be present in
existing numerical simulations are reviewed, with particular attention paid to
the advection of entropy/vorticity perturbations and the artificial acoustic
feedback from the accretor boundary condition. Several numerical tests are
proposed to test these mechanisms.",2005-02-08T17:33:41Z
Construction of Special Solutions for Nonintegrable Systems,"The Painleve test is very useful to construct not only the Laurent series
solutions of systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations but also the
elliptic and trigonometric ones. The standard methods for constructing the
elliptic solutions consist of two independent steps: transformation of a
nonlinear polynomial differential equation into a nonlinear algebraic system
and a search for solutions of the obtained system. It has been demonstrated by
the example of the generalized Henon-Heiles system that the use of the Laurent
series solutions of the initial differential equation assists to solve the
obtained algebraic system. This procedure has been automatized and generalized
on some type of multivalued solutions. To find solutions of the initial
differential equation in the form of the Laurent or Puiseux series we use the
Painleve test. This test can also assist to solve the inverse problem: to find
the form of a polynomial potential, which corresponds to the required type of
solutions. We consider the five-dimensional gravitational model with a scalar
field to demonstrate this.",2005-02-17T16:51:26Z
How to identify the youngest protostars,"We study the transition from a prestellar core to a Class 0 protostar, using
SPH to simulate the dynamical evolution, and a Monte Carlo radiative transfer
code to generate the SED and isophotal maps. For a prestellar core illuminated
by the standard interstellar radiation field, the luminosity is low and the SED
peaks at ~190 micron. Once a protostar has formed, the luminosity rises (due to
a growing contribution from accretion onto the protostar) and the peak of the
SED shifts to shorter wavelengths (~80-100 micron). However, by the end of the
Class 0 phase, the accretion rate is falling, the luminosity has decreased, and
the peak of the SED shifts back towards longer wavelengths (90-150 micron). In
our simulations, the density of material around the protostar remains
sufficiently high well into the Class 0 phase that the protostar only becomes
visible in the NIR if it is displaced from the centre dynamically. Raw submm/mm
maps of Class 0 protostars tend to be much more centrally condensed than those
of prestellar cores. However, when convolved with a typical telescope beam, the
difference in central concentration is less marked, although the Class 0
protostars appear more circular. Our results suggest that, if a core is deemed
to be prestellar on the basis of having no associated IRAS source, no cm radio
emission, and no outflow, but it has a circular appearance and an SED which
peaks at wavelengths below ~170 micron, it may well contain a very young Class
0 protostar.",2005-05-13T15:46:48Z
"The Serendipitous XMM-Newton Cluster Athens Survey (SEXCLAS): Sample
  selection and the cluster log N - log S","In this paper we serendipitously identify X-ray cluster candidates using
XMM-Newton archival observations complemented by 5-band optical photometric
follow-up observations (r~23 mag) as part of the X-ray Identification (XID)
programme. Our sample covers an area of ~2.1 sq. deg (15 XMM-Newton fields) and
comprises a total of 21 (19 serendipitous + 2 target) extended X-ray sources to
the limit f(0.5-2keV) ~ 6x10^{-15} cgs with a high probability (> 99.9%) of
being extended on the XMM-Newton images. Of the 21 cluster candidates 7 are
spectroscopically confirmed in the literature. Exploiting the optical data
available for these fields we discover that 68% of the X-ray cluster candidates
are associated with optical galaxy overdensities. We also attempt to constrain
the redshifts of our cluster candidates using photometric methods. We thus
construct the photometric redshift distribution of galaxies in the vicinity of
each X-ray selected cluster candidate and search for statistically significant
redshift peaks against that of the background distribution of field galaxies.
Comparison of the photometric with spectroscopic redshift estimates for the
confirmed clusters suggest that our simple method is robust out to z~0.5. For
clusters at higher z, deeper optical data are required to estimate reliable
photometric redshifts. Finally, using the sample of the 19 serendipitous X-ray
selected cluster candidates we estimate their surface density down to
f(0.5-2keV) ~ 6x10^{-15} cgs and find it to be in fair agreement with previous
and recent studies.",2005-03-18T10:33:36Z
Nuclear fusion in dense matter: Reaction rate and carbon burning,"In this paper we analyze the nuclear fusion rate between equal nuclei for all
five different nuclear burning regimes in dense matter (two thermonuclear
regimes, two pycnonuclear ones, and the intermediate regime). The rate is
determined by Coulomb barrier penetration in dense environments and by the
astrophysical S-factor at low energies. We evaluate previous studies of the
Coulomb barrier problem and propose a simple phenomenological formula for the
reaction rate which covers all cases. The parameters of this formula can be
varied, taking into account current theoretical uncertainties in the reaction
rate. The results are illustrated for the example of the ^{12}C+^{12}C fusion
reaction. This reaction is very important for the understanding of nuclear
burning in evolved stars, in exploding white dwarfs producing type Ia
supernovae, and in accreting neutron stars. The S-factor at stellar energies
depends on a reliable fit and extrapolation of the experimental data. We
calculate the energy dependence of the S-factor using a recently developed
parameter-free model for the nuclear interaction, taking into account the
effects of the Pauli nonlocality. For illustration, we analyze the efficiency
of carbon burning in a wide range of densities and temperatures of stellar
matter with the emphasis on carbon ignition at densities rho > 10^9 g/cc.",2005-06-16T14:55:08Z
"Closing in on a Short-Hard Burst Progenitor: Constraints from Early-Time
  Optical Imaging and Spectroscopy of a Possible Host Galaxy of GRB 050509b","The localization of the short-duration, hard-spectrum GRB 050509b was a
watershed event. Thanks to the nearly immediate relay of the GRB position by
Swift, we began imaging the GRB field 8 minutes after the burst and continued
for the following 8 days. No convincing optical/infrared candidate afterglow or
supernova was found for the object. We present a re-analysis of the XRT
afterglow and find an absolute position that is ~4"" to the west of the XRT
position reported previously. Close to this position is a bright elliptical
galaxy with redshift z=0.2248, about 1' from the center of a rich cluster of
galaxies. Based on positional coincidences, the GRB and the bright elliptical
are likely to be physically related. We thus have discovered evidence that at
least some short-duration, hard-spectra GRBs arise at cosmological distances.
However, while GRB 050509b was underluminous compared to long-duration GRBs, we
demonstrate that the ratio of the blast-wave energy to the gamma-ray energy is
consistent with that of long-duration GRBs. Based on this analysis, on the
location of the GRB (40 +- 13 kpc from a bright galaxy), on the galaxy type
(elliptical), and the lack of a coincident supernova, we suggest that there is
now observational consistency with the hypothesis that short-hard bursts arise
during the merger of a compact binary. We limit the properties of a
Li-Paczynski ''mini-supernova.'' Other progenitor models are still viable, and
additional rapidly localized bursts from the Swift mission will undoubtedly
help to further clarify the progenitor picture. (abridged)",2005-05-24T18:27:28Z
"Scattering of Gravitational Waves by the Weak Gravitational Fields of
  Lens Objects","We consider the scattering of the gravitational waves by the weak
gravitational fields of lens objects. We obtain the scattered gravitational
waveform by treating the gravitational potential of the lens to first order,
i.e. using the Born approximation. We find that the effect of scattering on the
waveform is roughly given by the Schwarzschild radius of the lens divided by
the wavelength of gravitational wave for a compact lens object. If the lenses
are smoothly distributed, the effect of scattering is of the order of the
convergence field $\kappa$ along the line of sight to the source. In the short
wavelength limit, the amplitude is magnified by $1+\kappa$, which is consistent
with the result in weak gravitational lensing.",2005-03-16T13:26:20Z
Measurement of core-shifts with astrometric multi-frequency calibration,"VLBI is unique, among the space geodetic techniques, in its contribution to
defining and maintaining the International Celestial Reference Frame, providing
precise measurements of coordinates of extragalactic radiosources. The quest
for increasing accuracy of VLBI geodetic products has lead to a deeper revision
of all aspects that might introduce errors in the analysis. The departure of
the observed sources from perfect, stable, compact and achromatic celestial
targets falls within this category. This paper is concerned with the impact of
unaccounted frequency-dependent position shifts of source cores in the analysis
of dual-band S/X VLBI geodesy observations, and proposes a new method to
measure them. The multi-frequency phase transfer technique developed and
demonstrated by Middelberg et al. (2005) increases the high frequency coherence
times of VLBI observations, using the observations at a lower frequency. Our
proposed SOURCE/FREQUENCY PHASE REFERENCING method endows it with astrometric
applications by adding a strategy to estimate the ionospheric contributions.
Here we report on the first successful application to measure the core shift of
the quasar 1038+528 A at S and X-bands, and validate the results by comparison
with those from standard phase referencing techniques. In this particular case,
and in general in the cm-wavelength regime, both methods are equivalent.
Moreover the proposed method opens a new horizon with targets and fields
suitable for high precision astrometric studies with VLBI, especially at high
frequencies where severe limitations imposed by the rapid fluctuations in the
troposphere prevent the use of standard phase referencing techniques.",2005-05-23T14:07:29Z
Is the Number of Giant Arcs in LCDM Consistent With Observations?,"We use high-resolution N-body simulations to study the galaxy-cluster
cross-sections and the abundance of giant arcs in the $\Lambda$CDM model.
Clusters are selected from the simulations using the friends-of-friends method,
and their cross-sections for forming giant arcs are analyzed. The background
sources are assumed to follow a uniform ellipticity distribution from 0 to 0.5
and to have an area identical to a circular source with diameter $1\arcsec$. We
find that the optical depth scales as the source redshift approximately as
$\tau_{1''} = 2.25 \times 10^{-6}/[1+(\zs/3.14)^{-3.42}]$ ($0.6<\zs<7$). The
amplitude is about 50% higher for an effective source diameter of $0.5\arcsec$.
The optimal lens redshift for giant arcs with the length-to-width ratio ($L/W$)
larger than 10 increases from 0.3 for $\zs=1$, to 0.5 for $\zs=2$, and to
0.7-0.8 for $\zs>3$. The optical depth is sensitive to the source redshift, in
qualitative agreement with Wambsganss et al. (2004). However, our overall
optical depth appears to be only $\sim$ 10% to 70% of those from previous
studies. The differences can be mostly explained by different power spectrum
normalizations ($\sigma_8$) used and different ways of determining the $L/W$
ratio. Finite source size and ellipticity have modest effects on the optical
depth. We also found that the number of highly magnified (with magnification
$|\mu|>10$) and ``undistorted'' images (with $L/W<3$) is comparable to the
number of giant arcs with $|\mu|>10$ and $L/W>10$. We conclude that our
predicted rate of giant arcs may be lower than the observed rate, although the
precise `discrepancy' is still unclear due to uncertainties both in theory and
observations.",2005-03-08T07:05:28Z
Disk-averaged Spectra & light-curves of Earth,"We are using computer models to explore the observational sensitivity to
changes in atmospheric and surface properties, and the detectability of
biosignatures, in the globally averaged spectra and light-curves of the Earth.
Using AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) data, as input for atmospheric and
surface properties, we have generated spatially resolved high-resolution
synthetic spectra using the SMART radiative transfer model, for a variety of
conditions, from the UV to the far-IR (beyond the range of current Earth-based
satellite data). We have then averaged over the visible disk for a number of
different viewing geometries to quantify the sensitivity to surface types and
atmospheric features as a function of viewing geometry, and spatial and
spectral resolution.
  These results have been processed with an instrument simulator to improve our
understanding of the detectable characteristics of Earth-like planets as viewed
by the first generation extrasolar terrestrial planet detection and
characterization missions (Terrestrial Planet Finder/Darwin and Life finder).
The wavelength range of our results are modelled over are applicable to both
the proposed visible coronograph and mid-infrared interferometer TPF
architectures.
  We have validated this model against disk-averaged observations by the Mars
Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer (MGS TES).
  This model was also used to analyze Earth-shine data for detectability of
planetary characteristics and biosignatures in disk-averaged spectra.",2005-02-11T14:44:50Z
On the nature of the radio quiet X-ray neutron star 1E 1207.4-5209,"The strange timing property of X-ray pulsar 1E 1207.4-5209 can be explained
by the hypothesis that it is a member of an ultra-compact binary system. This
paper confronts the ultra-compact assumption with the observed properties of
this pulsar. The gravitational potential well of an ultra-compact binary can
enlarge the corotation radius and thus make it possible for accreting material
to reach the surface of the NS in the low accretion rate case. Thus the
generation of the absorption features should be similar to the case of
accreting pulsars. The close equality of the energy loss by fast cooling of the
postsupernova neutron star and the energy dissipation needed for a wide binary
evolving to an ultra-compact binary demonstrates that the ultra-compact binary
may be formed in 10-100yr after the second supernova explosion. Moreover, the
ultra-compact binary hypothesis can well explain the the absence of optical
counterpart and the observed two black body emissions. We suggest a simple
method which can test the binary nature directly with XMM-Newton and Chandra
observations. We further predict that the temperature of the two black bodies
should vary at different pulse periods.",2005-03-29T00:26:58Z
Properties of FIRBACK-ELAIS 175 um sources in the ELAIS N2 region,"We report on a search for the optical counterparts of 175 um - selected
sources from the Far-Infrared Background (FIRBACK) survey in the European Large
Area ISO Survey (ELAIS) N2 field. Applying a likelihood ratio technique to
optical catalogues from the Isaac Newton Telescope - Wide Field Survey
(INT--WFS), we found optical identifications for 33 out of 55 FIRBACK sources
in this field. These were then reassessed in the light of associations with the
ELAIS final catalogue for the the N2 field, to yield a final set of 31
associations. We have investigated the nature of this population through a
comparison of their observed spectral energy distributions with predictions
from radiative transfer models which simulate the emission from both cirrus and
starburst components. We find the far-infrared sources to be 80 per cent star
bursting galaxies with their starburst component at a high optical depth. The
resulting SEDs were used to estimate far-infrared luminosities, star formation
rates, dust temperatures and dust masses. The N2 FIRBACK population is found to
consist of four suspected ULIRGs, a number of LIRGs and a population of low
redshift quiescently star forming galaxies. We also discuss the implications of
these results for current evolutionary models.",2005-06-13T14:50:50Z
Starless Cores,"Dense low mass cores in nearby clouds like Taurus and Auriga are some of the
simplest sites currently forming stars like our Sun. Because of their
simplicity and proximity, dense cores offer the clearest view of the different
phases of star formation, in particular the conditions prior to the onset of
gravitational collapse. Thanks to the combined analysis of the emission from
molecular lines and the emission/absorption from dust grains, the last several
years have seen a very rapid progress in our understanding of the structure and
chemical composition of starless cores. Previous contradictions between
molecular tracers are now understood to arise from core chemical
inhomogeneities, which are caused by the selective freeze out of molecules onto
cold dust grains. The analysis of the dust emission and absorption, in
addition, has allowed us to derive accurate density profiles, and has made
finally possible to carry out self consistent modeling of the internal
structure of starless cores. In this paper I briefly review the evolution of
core studies previous to the current golden age, and show how multi-tracer
emission can now be modeled in a systematic manner. Finally I show how we can
start to reconstruct the early history of core formation taking advantage of
the chemical changes in the gas.",2005-04-23T16:54:52Z
Galaxy Clusters and Dark Matter Properties,"Laboratory experiments, large-scale computer simulations and observational
cosmology have begun to make progress in the campaign to identify the particle
responsible for gravitationally-inferred dark matter. In this contribution we
discuss the dark matter density profiles in the cores of nearby galaxy clusters
and estimate the gamma-ray flux expected for MSSM dark matter over a range of
neutralino masses.",2005-03-07T21:00:03Z
The M/L ratio of massive young clusters,"We point out a strong time-evolution of the mass-to-light conversion factor
\eta commonly used to estimate masses of dense star clusters from observed
cluster radii and stellar velocity dispersions. We use a gas-dynamical model
coupled with the Cambridge stellar evolution tracks to compute line-of-sight
velocity dispersions and half-light radii weighted by the luminosity. Stars at
birth are assumed to follow the Salpeter mass function in the range [0.15--17
M_\sun]. We find that $\eta$, and hence the estimated cluster mass, increases
by factors as large as 3 over time-scales of 20 million years. Increasing the
upper mass limit to $50 M_\sun$ leads to a sharp rise of similar amplitude but
in as little as 10 million years.
  Fitting truncated isothermal (Michie-King) models to the projected light
profile leads to over-estimates of the concentration par ameter c of $\delta
c\approx 0.3$ compared to the same functional fit applied to the proj ected
mass density.",2005-02-25T06:40:44Z
A Search For Organic Molecules in Intermediate Redshift DLAs,"There has been a renewed interest in searching for diffuse interstellar bands
(DIBs) due to their probable connection to organic molecules and, thus, their
possible link to life in the Universe. Our group is undertaking an extensive
search for DIBs in DLAs via QSO absorption-line systems. Six of our DLA targets
are presented here. Our equivalent width (EW) limits for the 5780 DIB line
strongly suggests that DIB abundance is below the Milky Way expected value or
that metallicity plays a large role in DIB strengths.",2005-05-10T22:05:52Z
"UBVR and HST mid-UV and near-IR surface photometry and radial color
  gradients of late-type, irregular, and peculiar galaxies","We introduce a dataset of 142 mostly late-type spiral, irregular, and
peculiar (interacting or merging) nearby galaxies observed in UBVR at the
Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope (VATT), and present an analysis of their
radial color gradients. We confirm that nearby elliptical and early- to
mid-type spiral galaxies show either no or only small color gradients, becoming
slightly bluer with radius. In contrast, we find that late-type spiral,
irregular, peculiar, and merging galaxies become on average redder with
increasing distance from the center. The scatter in radial color gradient
trends increases toward later Hubble type. As a preliminary analysis of a
larger data-set obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we also analyze
the color gradients of six nearby galaxies observed with NICMOS in the near-IR
(H) and with WFPC2 in the mid-UV (F300W) and red (F814W). We discuss the
possible implication of these results on galaxy formation and compare our
nearby galaxy color gradients to those at high redshift. We present examples of
images and UBVR radial surface brightness and color profiles, and of the tables
of measurements; the full atlas and tables are published in the electronic
edition only.",2005-06-06T19:11:35Z
New Mass Loss Measurements from Astrospheric Lyman-alpha Absorption,"Measurements of stellar mass loss rates are used to assess how wind strength
varies with coronal activity and age for solar-like stars. Mass loss generally
increases with activity, but we find evidence that winds suddenly weaken at a
certain activity threshold. Very active stars are often observed to have polar
starspots, and we speculate that the magnetic field geometry associated with
these spots may be inhibiting the winds. Our inferred mass-loss/age relation
represents an empirical estimate of the history of the solar wind. This result
is important for planetary studies as well as solar/stellar astronomy, since
solar wind erosion may have played an important role in the evolution of
planetary atmospheres.",2005-06-17T02:21:34Z
OI Line Emission in the Quasar PG 1116+215,"By observing the near-infrared spectrum of the quasar PG 1116+215 at z =
0.176 and combining with the HST/FOS spectrum, we obtained the relative
strengths of three permitted OI lines ({lambda}1304, {lambda}8446, and
{lambda}11287) in a quasar for the first time. The photon flux ratios of the OI
lines of the quasar were compared with those previously measured in a Seyfert 1
and six narrow-line Seyfert 1s. No significant differences were found in the OI
line flux ratios between the quasar and the other Seyferts, suggesting that the
gas density in the OI and FeII line-emitting regions in the quasar is of the
same order as those in low-luminosity AGNs. It was also found that the line
width of OI {lambda}11287 is significantly narrower than that of Ly{alpha},
which is consistent with OI and FeII emission occurring in the partly ionized
regions at the outermost portion of the broad-line region where velocities are
small.",2005-05-29T05:04:49Z
GEOTAIL observation of the SGR1806-20 Giant Flare: The first 600 ms,"On December 27, 2004, plasma particle detectors on the GEOTAIL spacecraft
detected an extremely strong signal of hard X-ray photons from the giant flare
of SGR1806-20, a magnetar candidate. While practically all gamma-ray detectors
on any satellites were saturated during the first ~500 ms interval after the
onset, one of the particle detectors on GEOTAIL was not saturated and provided
unique measurements of the hard X-ray intensity and the profile for the first
600 ms interval with 5.48 ms time resolution. After ~50 ms from the initial
rapid onset, the peak photon flux (integrated above ~50 keV) reached the order
of 10^7 photons sec^{-1} cm^{-2}. Assuming a blackbody spectrum with kT=175
keV, we estimate the peak energy flux to be 21 erg sec^{-1} cm^{-2} and the
fluence (for 0-600 ms) to be 2.4 erg cm^{-2}. The implied energy release
comparable to the magnetic energy stored in a magnetar (~10^{47} erg) suggests
an extremely efficient energy release mechanism.",2005-02-16T13:02:52Z
XMM-Newton observation of the drifting pulsar B0943+10,"Radio pulsar subpulse drifting has been interpreted as rotation of sub-beams
(sparks) of pair plasma produced by intermittent breakdowns of an inner vacuum
gap above the pulsar polar cap. This model also predicts strong thermal X-ray
emission from the polar cap caused by inflowing particles created in spark
discharges. We have observed the best-studied drifting pulsar B0943+10 with
XMM-Newton and detected a point source coincident with the radio pulsar
position. Its spectrum could be fitted with a thermal blackbody model, although
a power-law model is also acceptable. The thermal fit gives a bolometric
luminosity L_bol ~ 5 x 10^{28} erg/s and a surface area A ~ 10^3 (T/3MK)^{-4}
m^2, much smaller than the conventional polar cap area, 6 x 10^4 m^2. Such
thermal radiation can be interpreted as emitted from footprints of sparks
drifting in an inner gap of a height h ~ 0.1 - 0.2 r_pc, where r_pc is the
polar cap radius. However, the original vacuum gap model by Ruderman and
Sutherland requires some modification to reconcile the X-ray and radio data.",2005-03-18T22:16:20Z
A Phoenix Modelatmosphere Grid For GAIA,"We present the results of a set of model atmospheres and synthetic spectra
computed with the PHOENIX code. The models cover a range of effective
temperatures 2700 K <= T_eff <= 10 000 K, gravities (-0.5 <= log(g)<= 5.5) and
metalicities (-4.0 <= [Z/H] <= +0.5). In addition, variations of alpha elements
are considered for each metalicity. The models are computed with a homogeneous
set of input data in order to allow for direct relative comparison between the
models. For example, all models use a mixing length of l/H_p = 2.0. We provide
synthetic spectra with a resolution of 0.2 nm from the UV to the infrared for
all models. We give a brief overview of the input physics and show illustrative
results. All synthetic spectra are available via ftp:

Quantitative Spectroscopy of Photospheric-Phase Type II Supernovae,"We present first results on the quantitative spectroscopic analysis of the
photospheric-phase of Type II supernovae (SN). The analyses are based on the
non-LTE model atmosphere code, CMFGEN, of Hillier & Miller (1998). A key asset
of CMFGEN is its thorough treatment of line-blanketing due to metal species.
  From its applicability to hot star environments, the main modifications to
the source code were to allow a linear velocity law, a power-law density
distribution, an adaptive grid to handle the steep H recombination/ionization
front occurring in cooler SN models, and a routine to compute the gray
temperature structure in the presence of large velocities. In this first paper
we demonstrate the ability of CMFGEN to reproduce, with a high level of
accuracy, the UV and optical observations of a sample of well observed Type II
SN, i.e. SN1987A and SN1999em, at representative stages of their photospheric
evolution. Two principal stages of SN are modeled - that where hydrogen is
fully ionized, and that in which H is only partially ionized. We provide
detailed and accurate line identifications for our sample of epochs. We discuss
the impact on the SED of varying the density exponent, the spatial scale of the
SN, the value of Rmax and the metallicity; we illustrate the formation sites
for selected lines. Both Hydrogen Balmer and Helium lines (when present) are
very well reproduced, even for our adopted CNO-equilibrium abundance values
adequate for a massive supergiant progenitor star. NII lines are also predicted
in the blue-wing of both Hbeta and HeI 5875A, and thus not associated with
peculiar absorption/emission far above the photosphere. We finally present a
pedagogical discussion of P-Cygni profile formation and explain, e.g., the
noticeable blue-shift of Halpha in early time spectra (much abridged abstract).",2005-04-01T17:00:52Z
"Probing the circumstellar structures of T Tauri stars and their
  relationship to those of Herbig stars","We present Halpha spectropolarimetry observations of a sample of 10 bright T
Tauri stars, supplemented with new Herbig Ae/Be star data. A change in the
linear polarisation across Halpha is detected in most of the T Tauri (9/10) and
Herbig Ae (9/11) objects, which we interpret in terms of a compact source of
line photons that is scattered off a rotating accretion disk. We find
consistency between the position angle (PA) of the polarisation and those of
imaged disk PAs from infrared and millimetre imaging and interferometry
studies, probing much larger scales. For the Herbig Ae stars AB Aur, MWC 480
and CQ Tau, we find the polarisation PA to be perpendicular to the imaged disk,
which is expected for single scattering. On the other hand, the polarisation PA
aligns with the outer disk PA for the T Tauri stars DR Tau and SU Aur and FU
Ori, conforming to the case of multiple scattering. This difference can be
explained if the inner disks of Herbig Ae stars are optically thin, whilst
those around our T Tauri stars and FU Ori are optically thick. Furthermore, we
develop a novel technique that combines known inclination angles and our recent
Monte Carlo models to constrain the inner rim sizes of SU Aur, GW Ori, AB Aur,
and CQ Tau. Finally, we consider the connection of the inner disk structure
with the orientation of the magnetic field in the foreground interstellar
medium: for FU Ori and DR Tau, we infer an alignment of the stellar axis and
the larger magnetic field direction.",2005-02-25T11:24:56Z
"Near-Infrared photometry of four metal-rich Bulge globular clusters:
  NGC6304, NGC6569, NGC6637, NGC6638","We present high-quality near-Infrared photometry of four Bulge metal-rich
globular clusters, namely: NGC 6304, NGC 6569, NGC 6637 and NGC 6638. By using
the observed Colour-Magnitude Diagrams we derived a photometric estimates of
the cluster reddening and distance. We performed a detailed analysis of the Red
Giant Branch, presenting a complete description of morphologic parameters and
evolutionary features (Bump and Tip). Photometric estimates of the cluster
metallicity have been obtained by using the updated set of relations (published
by our group) linking the metal abundance to a variety of near-Infrared indices
measured along the Red Giant Branch. The detection of the Red Giant Branch Bump
and the Tip is also presented and briefly discussed.",2005-05-05T18:15:01Z
"PMAS, the Potsdam Multi-Aperture Spectrophotometer. I. Design,
  Manufacture, and Performance","We describe the design, manufacture, commissioning, and performance of PMAS,
the Potsdam Multi-Aperture Spectrophotometer. PMAS is a dedicated integral
field spectrophotometer, optimized to cover the optical wavelength regime of
0.35--1um. It is based on the lens array -- fiber bundle principle of
operation. The instrument employs an all-refractive fiber spectrograph, built
with CaF2 optics, to provide good transmission and high image quality over the
entire nominal wavelength range. A set of user-selectable reflective gratings
provides low to medium spectral resolution in first order of approx. 1.5, 3.2,
and 7 A, depending on the groove density (1200, 600, 300 gr/mm). While the
standard integral field unit (IFU) uses a 16x16 element lens array, which
provides seeing-limited sampling in a relatively small field-of-view (FOV) in
one of three magnifications (8x8, 12x12, or 16x16 arcsec^2, respectively), a
recently retrofitted bare fiber bundle IFU (PPak) expands the FOV to a
hexagonal area with a footprint of 65x74 arcsec^2. Other special features
include a cryogenic CCD camera for field acquisition and guiding, a nod-shuffle
mode for beam switching and improved sky background subtraction, and a scanning
Fabry-Perot etalon in combination with the standard IFU (PYTHEAS mode). PMAS
was initially designed and built as an experimental traveling instrument with
optical interfaces to various telescopes (Calar Alto 3.5m, ESO-VLT, LBT). It is
offered as a common user instrument at Calar Alto under contract with MPIA
Heidelberg since 2002.",2005-02-28T16:43:49Z
"On the stellar populations in NGC 185 and NGC 205, and the nuclear star
  cluster in NGC 205 from Hubble Space Telescope observations","[Abridged] We present a first detailed analysis of resolved stellar
populations in the dwarf galaxies NGC 185 and NGC 205 based on archival V- and
I-band WFPC2 pointings. For NGC 185 we deduce that star formation was probably
still active about 4 x 10^8 yr ago. Key abundance-related results are: (1) We
identify ancient stars with [Fe/H] <~ -1.5 dex by a well-defined horizontal
branch (HB). (2) We find a prominent RGB/ faint-AGB clump/ bump- like feature
with the same mean V-band magnitude as the HB, within uncertainties; from a
comparison with theory, ancient stars have [Fe/H] ~ -1.5 dex, with a higher
abundance level for intermediate-age stars. (3) From colour information we
infer that the median [Fe/H] > -1.11 +/- 0.08 dex for ancient stars. For NGC
205, we record (m-M)o = 24.76 +/- 0.1 mag, based on the RGB I-band tip
magnitude method. We find that stars were probably still forming less than 3 x
10^8 yr ago, which is compatible with star formation triggered by an
interaction with M31. Key abundance-related results are: (1) The RGB/ faint-AGB
is significantly skewed to redder values than that of a control field in the
outskirts of M31; it probably results from a relatively narrow metallicity and
or age range for a significant fraction of the dwarf's stars. (2) For ancient
stars we infer from colour information that the median [Fe/H] > -1.06+/-0.04
dex. We briefly compare the stellar populations of NGC 205, NGC 185 and NGC
147.
  Finally, we find an apparent blue excess in the outer region of the nuclear
star cluster in NGC 205. It is as compact as a typical galactic globular
cluster, but is quite bright (10^6 L_solar,R); and by matching its blue colour
with models, its stellar population is young, up to a few times 10^8 yr old.",2005-03-03T12:58:06Z
"The Mass Function of Dark Matter Haloes in a Cosmological Model with a
  Running Primordial Power Spectrum","We present the first study on the mass functions of Jenkins et al (J01) and
an estimate of their corresponding largest virialized dark halos in the
Universe for a variety of dark-energy cosmological models with a running
spectral index. Compared with the PL-CDM model, the RSI-CDM model can raise the
mass abundance of dark halos for small mass halos at lower redshifts, but it is
not apparent on scales of massive mass halos. Particularly, this discrepancy
increases largely with the decrease of redshift, and the RSI-CDM model can
suppress the mass abundance on any scale of halo masses at higher redshift. As
for the largest mass of virialized halos, the spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM
models give more massive mass of virialized objects than other models for both
of PL-CDM and RSI-CDM power spectral indexs, and the RSI-CDM model can enhance
the mass of largest virialized halos for all of models considered in this
paper. So we probably distinguish the PL-CDM and RSI-CDM models by the largest
virialized halos in the future survey of cluster of galaxies.",2005-04-09T05:14:02Z
"Cataclysmic variables from a ROSAT/2MASS selection I: Four new
  intermediate polars","We report the first results from a new search for cataclysmic variables (CVs)
using a combined X-ray (ROSAT) / infrared (2MASS) target selection that
discriminates against background AGN. Identification spectra were obtained at
the Isaac Newton Telescope for a total of 174 targets, leading to the discovery
of 12 new CVs. Initially devised to find short-period low-mass-transfer CVs,
this selection scheme has been very successful in identifying new intermediate
polars. Photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations identify four of
the new CVs as intermediate polars: 1RXSJ063631.9+353537 (Porb~201min,
Pspin=1008.3408s or 930.5829), 1RXSJ070407.9+262501 (Porb~250min,
Pspin=480.708s), 1RXSJ173021.5-055933 (Porb=925.27min, Pspin=128.0s), and
1RXSJ180340.0+401214 (Porb=160.21min, Pspin=1520.51s). RXJ1730, also a
moderately bright hard X-ray source in the INTEGRAL/IBIS Galactic plane survey,
resembles the enigmatic AE Aqr. It is likely that its white dwarf is not
rotating at the spin equilibrium period, and the system may represent a
short-lived phase in CV evolution.",2005-04-21T07:52:02Z
"CO Line Emission and Absorption from the HL Tau Disk: Where is all the
  dust?","We present high-resolution infrared spectra of HL Tau, a heavily embedded
young star. The spectra exhibit broad emission lines of hot CO gas as well as
narrow absorption lines of cold CO gas. The column density for this cooler
material (7.5+/-0.2 x 10^18 cm-2) indicates a large column of absorbing gas
along the line of sight. In dense interstellar clouds, this column density of
CO gas is associated with Av~52 magnitudes. However, the extinction toward this
source (Av~23) suggests that there is less dust along the line of sight than
inferred from the CO absorption data. We discuss three possibilities for the
apparent paucity of dust along the line of sight through the flared disk: 1)
the dust extinction has been underestimated due to differences in circumstellar
grain properties, such as grain agglomeration; 2) the effect of scattering has
been underestimated and the actual extinction is much higher; or (3) the line
of sight through the disk is probing a gas-rich, dust-depleted region, possibly
due to the stratification of gas and dust in a pre-planetary disk.",2005-02-03T18:52:08Z
"A ""pulsational"" distance determination for the Large Magellanic Cloud","We present results from the theoretical modelling of the observed B,V light
curves of 14 RR Lyrae stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The sample includes
7 fundamental and 7 first overtone pulsators covering the metallicity range
from -2.12 to -0.79 dex in [Fe/H], with average value of -1.54 dex. Masses,
intrinsic luminosities, effective temperatures, and reddenings were derived by
fitting high accuracy multiband light curves available for these RR Lyrae stars
to nonlinear convective pulsation models. Individual distance moduli were
determined for each variable, they lead to an average distance modulus for the
Large Magellanic Cloud of (m-M)o= 18.54 +/-0.02 (sigm= 0.09 mag, standard
deviation of the average), in good agreement with the ""long"" astronomical
distance scale.",2005-02-11T10:14:18Z
"Three active M dwarfs within 8 pc: L 449-1, L 43-72, & LP 949-15","Three nearby star candidates were selected as bright 2MASS point sources
without associated optical sources, i.e. with potentially large proper motions,
subsequently confirmed by multi-epoch optical data from the SuperCOSMOS Sky
Surveys. All three objects are listed in the NLTT catalogue of high proper
motion stars. Follow-up spectroscopic observations allowed us to classify L
449-1 as M4.0e dwarf at 5.7 pc, L43-72 as M4.5e dwarf at 7.2 pc, and LP 949-15
as M5.0e dwarf at 6.1 pc, using known absolute $JHK_\mathrm{s}$ magnitudes of
dwarfs with corresponding spectral types, respectively. All three stars exhibit
$H{\alpha}$ emission lines, and all three can be identified with bright X-ray
sources. The available ROSAT light curves of two of the objects show typical
flare-like variability. Thus, all three stars are active, very close potential
neighbours of the Sun, previously not mentioned as such, certainly deserving
further attention. In particular, these are very promising candidates for
trigonometric parallax programs.",2005-05-12T08:01:46Z
A fresh view on Henize 2-10 with VLT/NAOS-CONICA,"We present high-resolution observations of Henize 2-10 in Ks (2.2um), L'
(3.8um), M' (4.8um) bands. These allow for the first time to track accurately
the structures at the heart of the galaxy from the optical to the radio. All
radio knots previously observed can now be associated with L' and Ks emitting
regions. This implies a revision of their physical nature. Instead of highly
extinguished ultra-dense HII regions, we propose that two of the 5 radio knots
are either supernova remnants or ""normal"" HII regions, while the remaining
three are bona fide ultra-dense HII regions, although less obscured than was
previously thought.",2005-06-02T02:29:39Z
"Klein-Nishina Effects in the Spectra of Non-Thermal Sources Immersed in
  External Radiation Fields","We study Klein-Nishina (KN) effects in the spectrum produced by a steady
state, non-thermal source where rapidly accelerated electrons cool by emitting
synchrotron radiation and Compton upscattering ambient photons produced outside
the source. We focus on the case where the radiation density inside the source
exceeds that of the magnetic field. We show that the KN reduction in the
electron Compton cooling rate causes the steady-state electron spectrum to
harden at energies above \gamma_{KN}, where \gamma_{KN}= 1/4\epsilon_0 and
\epsilon_0=h\nu_0/m_ec^2 is the characteristic ambient photon energy. The
source synchrotron spectrum thus shows a high-energy ``bump'' or excess even
though the electron acceleration spectrum has no such excess. In contrast, the
low-energy Compton gamma-ray spectrum shows little distortion because the
electron hardening compensates for the KN decline in the scattering rate. For
sufficiently high electron energies, however, Compton cooling becomes so
inefficient that synchrotron cooling dominates -- an effect omitted in most
previous studies. The hardening of the electron distribution thus stops,
leading to a rapid decline in Compton gamma-ray emission, i.e., a strong
spectral break whose location does not depend on the maximum electron energy.
This break can limit the importance of Compton gamma-ray pair production on
ambient photons and implies that a source's synchrotron luminosity may exceed
its Compton luminosity even though the source magnetic field energy density is
smaller than the ambient radiation energy density. We discuss the importance of
these KN effects in blazars, micro-quasars, and pulsar binaries.",2005-04-18T14:20:42Z
Evolution of X-ray emission from young massive star clusters,"The evolution of X-ray emission from young massive star clusters is modeled,
taking into account the emission from the stars as well as from the cluster
wind. It is shown that the level and character of the soft (0.2-10 keV) X-ray
emission change drastically with cluster age and are tightly linked with
stellar evolution. Using the modern X-ray observations of massive stars we show
that the correlation between bolometric and X-ray luminosity known for single O
stars also holds for O+O and O+Wolf-Rayet (WR) binaries. The diffuse emission
originates from the cluster wind heated by the kinetic energy of stellar winds
and supernova explosions. To model the evolution of the cluster wind, the mass
and energy yields from a population synthesis are used as input to a
hydrodynamic model. It is shown that in a very young clusters the emission from
the cluster wind is low. When the cluster evolves, WR stars are formed. Their
strong stellar winds power an increasing X-ray emission of the cluster wind.
Subsequent supernova explosions pump the level of diffuse emission even higher.
Clusters at this evolutionary stage may have no X-ray bright stellar point
sources, but a relatively high level of diffuse emission. A supernova remnant
may become a dominant X-ray source, but only for a short time interval of a few
thousand years. We retrieve and analyse Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of
six massive star clusters located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Our model
reproduces the observed diffuse and point-source emission from these LMC
clusters, as well as from the Galactic clusters Arches, Quintuplet and NGC
3603.",2005-05-25T14:20:56Z
"Type Ia supernovae tests of fractal bubble universe with no cosmic
  acceleration","The unexpected dimness of Type Ia supernovae at redshifts z >~ 1 has over the
past 7 years been seen as an indication that the expansion of the universe is
accelerating. A new model cosmology, the ""fractal bubble model"", has been
proposed by one of us [gr-qc/0503099], based on the idea that our observed
universe resides in an underdense bubble remnant from a primordial epoch of
cosmic inflation, together with a new solution for averaging in an
inhomogeneous universe. Although there is no cosmic acceleration, it is claimed
that the luminosity distance of type Ia supernovae data will nonetheless fit
the new model, since it mimics a Milne universe at low redshifts. In this paper
the hypothesis is tested statistically against the available type Ia supernovae
data by both chi-square and Bayesian methods. While the standard model with
cosmological constant Omega_Lambda = 1-Omega_m is favoured by a Bayesian
analysis with wide priors, the comparison depends strongly on the priors chosen
for the density parameter, Omega_m. The fractal bubble model gives better
agreement generally for Omega_m<0.2. It also gives reasonably good fits for all
the range, Omega_m=0.01-0.55, allowing the possibility of a viable cosmology
with just baryonic matter, or alternatively with both baryonic matter and
additional cold dark matter.",2005-04-08T10:57:51Z
Rotation in Gravitational Lenses,"Gravitational lensing deflects light. A single lens deflector can only shear
images, but cannot induce rotations. Multiple lens planes can induce rotations.
Such rotations can be observed in quadruply imaged sources, and can be used to
distinguish between two proposed solutions of the flux anomaly problem:
substructures in lensing galaxies vs large scale structure. We predict the
expected amount of rotation due to large scale structure in strong lensing
systems, and show how this effect can be measured using ~ mas VLBI astrometry
of quadruple lenses with extended source structures. The magnitude of rotation
is around one degree. The biggest theoretical uncertainty is the power spectrum
of dark matter on very small scales. This procedure can potentially be turned
around to measure the dark matter power spectrum on very small scales. We list
the predicted RMS rotation angles for several quadruple lenses with known lens
and source redshifts.",2005-06-02T10:47:47Z
XMM-Newton spectroscopy of the metal depleted T Tauri star TWA 5,"We present results of X-ray spectroscopy for TWA 5, a member of the young TW
Hydrae association, observed with XMM-Newton. TWA~5 is a multiple system which
shows Halpha emission, a signature typical of classical T Tauri stars, but no
infrared excess. From the analysis of the RGS and EPIC spectra, we have derived
the emission measure distribution vs. temperature of the X-ray emitting plasma,
its abundances, and the electron density. The characteristic temperature and
density of the plasma suggest a corona similar to that of weak-line T Tauri
stars and active late-type main sequence stars. TWA 5 also shows a low iron
abundance (~0.1 times the solar photospheric one) and a pattern of increasing
abundances for elements with increasing first ionization potential reminiscent
of the inverse FIP effect observed in highly active stars. The especially high
ratio Ne/Fe~10 is similar to that of the classical T Tauri star TW Hya, where
the accreting material has been held responsible for the X-ray emission. We
discuss the possible role of an accretion process in this scenario. Since all T
Tauri stars in the TW Hydrae association studied so far have very high Ne/Fe
ratios, we also propose that environmental conditions may cause this effect.",2005-05-04T15:39:51Z
"Large Magellanic Cloud Microlensing Optical Depth with Imperfect Event
  Selection","I present a new analysis of the MACHO Project 5.7 year Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC) microlensing data set that incorporates the effects of contamination of
the microlensing event sample by variable stars. Photometric monitoring of
MACHO LMC microlensing event candidates by the EROS and OGLE groups has
revealed that one of these events is likely to be a variable star, while
additional data has confirmed that many of the other events are very likely to
be microlensing. This additional data on the nature of the MACHO microlensing
candidates is incorporated into a simple likelihood analysis to derive a
probability distribution for the number of MACHO microlens candidates that are
true microlensing events. This analysis shows that 10-12 of the 13 events that
passed the MACHO selection criteria are likely to be microlensing events, with
the other 1-3 being variable stars. This likelihood analysis is also used to
show that the main conclusions of the MACHO LMC analysis are unchanged by the
variable star contamination. The microlensing optical depth toward the LMC is =
1.0 +/- 0.3 * 10^{-7}. If this is due to microlensing by known stellar
populations, plus an additional population of lens objects in the Galactic
halo, then the new halo population would account for 16% of the mass of a
standard Galactic halo. The MACHO detection exceeds the expected background of
2 events expected from ordinary stars in standard models of the Milky Way and
LMC at the 99.98% confidence level. The background prediction is increased to 3
events if maximal disk models are assumed for both the MilkyWay and LMC, but
this model fails to account for the full signal seen by MACHO at the 99.8%
confidence level.",2005-02-17T16:30:40Z
"Triggering and Feedback: The Relation between the HI Gas and the
  Starburst in the Dwarf Galaxy NGC 1569","As part of our study on the impact of violent star formation on the
interstellar medium (ISM) of dwarf galaxies, we report observations of neutral
atomic hydrogen (HI) in the post-starburst dwarf galaxy NGC 1569.
High-resolution measurements with the VLA (B-, C- and D-array) are aimed at
identifying morphological and kinematical signatures in the HI caused by the
starburst. Our kinematical data suggest a huge hole in the HI distribution,
probably due to the large number of supernovae explosions in the center of the
galaxy over the past 20 Myr. Investigating the large-scale HI structure, we
confirm the existence of a possible HI companion and a so-called HI bridge east
of NGC 1569. Furthermore, we report the detection of additional low-intensity
HI halo emission, which leads us to suggest a revised halo structure. Based on
the new picture, we discuss the origin of the halo gas and possible
implications for the evolution of the starburst in NGC 1569.",2005-04-10T13:50:05Z
"A Search for Radio Emission from the Young 16-ms X-ray Pulsar PSR
  J0537-6910","PSR J0537-6910 is a young, energetic, rotation-powered X-ray pulsar with a
spin period of 16 ms located in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We have searched
for previously undetected radio pulsations (both giant and standard) from this
pulsar in a 12-hour observation taken at 1400 MHz with the Parkes 64-m radio
telescope. The very large value of the magnetic field at the light cylinder
radius suggests that this pulsar might be emitting giant radio pulses like
those seen in other pulsars with similar field strengths. No radio emission of
either kind was detected from the pulsar, and we have established an upper
limit of ~ 25 mJy kpc^2 for the average 1400-MHz radio luminosity of PSR
J0537-6910. The 5-sigma single-pulse detection threshold was ~ 750 mJy for a
single 80-us sample. These limits are likely to be the best obtainable until
searches with greatly improved sensitivity can be made with next-generation
radio instruments.",2005-03-23T21:42:53Z
A detailed study of the rotating toroids in G31.41+0.31 and G24.78+0.08,"We present the results of high angular resolution millimeter observations of
gas and dust toward G31.41+0.31 and G24.78+0.08, two high-mass star forming
regions where four rotating massive toroids have been previously detected by
Beltran et al. (2004). The CH3CN (12-11) emission of the toroids in G31.41+0.31
and core A1 in G24.78+0.08 has been modeled assuming that it arises from a
disk-like structure seen edge-on, with a radial velocity field. For G31.41+0.31
the model properly fits the data for a velocity v_rot~1.7 km/s at the outer
radius R_out~13400 AU and an inner radius R_inn~1340 AU, while for core A1 in
G24.78+0.08 the best fit is obtained for v_rot~2.0 km/s at R_out~7700 AU and
R_inn~2300 AU. Unlike the rotating disks detected around less luminous stars,
these toroids are not undergoing Keplerian rotation. From the modeling itself,
however, it is not possible to distinguish between constant rotation or
constant angular velocity, since both velocity fields suitably fit the data.
The best fit models have been computed adopting a temperature gradient of the
type T proportional R^{-3/4}, with a temperature at the outer radius T_out~100
K for both cores. The M_dyn needed for equilibrium derived from the models is
much smaller than the mass of the cores, suggesting that such toroids are
unstable and undergoing gravitational collapse. The collapse is also supported
by the CH3^{13}CN or CH3CN line width measured in the cores, which increases
toward the center of the toroids. The estimates of v_inf and \dot M_acc are ~2
km/s and 3x10^{-2} M_sun/yr for G31.41+0.31, and ~1.2 km/s and ~9x10^{-3}
M_sun/yr for G24.78+0.08 A1. Such large accretion rates could weaken the effect
of stellar winds and radiation pressure and allow further accretion on the
star.",2005-02-03T16:02:49Z
Radio Spectral Index Study of the SNRs OA184 and VRO42.05.01,"New images of the Supernova Remnants (SNRs) OA184 and VRO42.05.01 are
presented at 408 MHz and 1420 MHz, from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey
(CGPS) data. The SNRs' flux densities at both 408 MHz and 1420 MHz are found
and corrected for flux from compact sources within the SNRs. The integrated
flux-density based spectral indices (S$_{\nu}$$\propto$$\nu$$^{-\alpha}$) are
0.25+-0.03 for OA184 and 0.36+-0.06 for VRO42.05.01. These agree with the
respective T-T plot spectral indexes of 0.23+-0.06 and 0.36+-0.03. OA184's
spectral index is smaller than previously published values. The older flux
density values of OA184 from lower resolution data include a contribution from
a non-SNR ridge emission region and from compact sources within OA184.
Subtracting these contributions results in a spectral index of 0.32+-0.06 (38
MHz to 2695 MHz) or 0.28+-0.06 (408 MHz to 2695 MHz). Correction of published
fluxes for point sources for VRO.42.05.01 results in a spectral index of
0.32+-0.05 for 38 MHz to 2695 MHz. We also find spatial variations of spectral
index. For OA184 $\alpha$ varies from 0.1 to 0.3 (with errors $\simeq$0.1). For
VRO42.05.01, the shell region has $\alpha$=0.31 and the wing region has
$\alpha=0.47$ (with errors $\simeq$0.03).",2005-05-24T21:27:11Z
Mirror World and Axion: Relaxing Cosmological Bounds,"The cosmological (upper) limit on the Peccei-Quinn constant, related to the
primordial oscillations of the axion field, can be relaxed for a mirror axion
model. The simple reason is that the mirror world is colder and so the behavior
of the axion temperature-dependent mass is dominated by the contribution from
the mirror sector. So the coherent oscillations start earlier and
correspondingly the axion mass density \Omega_a h^2 is reduced.",2005-04-28T16:14:46Z
"Detection of pulsations and a spectral feature in the X-ray emission of
  the isolated neutron star 1RXS J214303.7+065419/RBS 1774","We report on the results of a deep XMM-Newton observation of RBS 1774, the
most recent dim isolated neutron star candidate found in the ROSAT archive
data. Spectral and timing analysis of the high-quality PN and MOS data confirm
the association of this source with an isolated neutron star. The spectrum is
thermal and blackbody-like, and there is evidence at a significance level >
4sigma that the source is an X-ray pulsar, with spin period of 9.437 s.
Spectral fitting reveils the presence of an absorption feature at ~0.7 keV, but
at this level data do not have enough resolution to allow us to discriminate
between an absorption line or an edge. We compare the newly measured properties
of RBS 1774 with those of other known dim isolated neutron stars, and discuss
possible interpretations for the absorption feature.",2005-03-10T12:13:32Z
The Near-UV Pulse Profile and Spectrum of the Pulsar PSR B0656+14,"We have observed the middle-aged pulsar PSR B0656+14 with the prism and the
NUV MAMA detector of the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) to measure
the pulsar spectrum and periodic pulsations in the near-ultraviolet (NUV). The
pulsations are clearly detected, double-peaked and very similar to the optical
pulse profile. The NUV pulsed fraction is 70 +/- 12%. The spectral slope of the
dereddened phase-integrated spectrum in the 1800 - 3200 A range is 0.35 +/- 0.5
which together with the high pulse fraction indicates a non-thermal origin for
the NUV emission. The total flux in the range 1700-3400 A is estimated to be
3.4 +/- 0.3e-15 erg/s/cm2 when corrected for E(B-V)=0.03. At a distance of 288
pc this corresponds to a luminosity 3.4e28 erg/s assuming isotropy of the
emission. We compare the NUV pulse profile with observations from radio to
gamma-rays. The first NUV sub-pulse is in phase with the gamma-ray pulse
marginally detected with the EGRET, while the second NUV sub-pulse is similar
both in shape and in phase with the non- thermal pulse in hard X-rays. This
indicates a single origin of the non-thermal emission in the optical-NUV and in
the X-rays. This is also supported by the observed NUV spectral slope, which is
compatible with a blackbody plus power-law fit extended from the X-ray range,
but dominated by the power-law component in most of the NUV range.",2005-06-07T19:27:18Z
Beyond the CDMS-II Dark Matter Search: SuperCDMS,"Presently the CDMS-II collaboration's Weakly Interacting Massive Particle
(WIMP) search at the Soudan Underground Laboratory sets the most stringent
exclusion limits of any WIMP cold dark matter direct-detection experiment. To
extend our reach further, to WIMP-nucleon cross sections in the range $10^{-46}
- 10^{-44}$cm$^2$, we propose SuperCDMS, which would take advantage of a very
deep site. One promising site is the recently approved SNOLab facility in
Canada. In this paper we will present our overall plan, identify primary
issues, and set the goals that need to be met prior to embarking upon each
phase of SuperCDMS.",2005-03-28T03:30:25Z
Discovery of an X-ray-Luminous Galaxy Cluster at z=1.4,"We report the discovery of a massive, X-ray-luminous cluster of galaxies at
z=1.393, the most distant X-ray-selected cluster found to date. XMMU
J2235.3-2557 was serendipitously detected as an extended X-ray source in an
archival XMM-Newton observation of NGC 7314. VLT-FORS2 R and z band snapshot
imaging reveals an over-density of red galaxies in both angular and color
spaces. The galaxy enhancement is coincident in the sky with the X-ray
emission; the cluster red sequence at R-z ~ 2.1 identifies it as a
high-redshift candidate. Subsequent VLT-FORS2 multi-object spectroscopy
unambiguously confirms the presence of a massive cluster based on 12 concordant
redshifts in the interval 1.38<z<1.40. The preliminary cluster velocity
dispersion is 762+/-265 km/s. VLT-ISAAC Ks and J band images underscore the
rich distribution of red galaxies associated with the cluster. Based on a 45 ks
XMM-Newton observation, we find the cluster has an aperture-corrected,
unabsorbed X-ray flux of f_X = (3.6 +/- 0.3) x 10^{-14} erg/cm^2/s, a
rest-frame X-ray luminosity of L_X = (3.0 +/- 0.2) x 10^{44} h_70^{-2} erg/s
(0.5--2.0 keV), and a temperature of kT=6.0 (+2.5, -1.8) keV. Though XMMU
J2235.3-2557 is likely the first confirmed z>1 cluster found with XMM-Newton,
the relative ease and efficiency of discovery demonstrates that it should be
possible to build large samples of z>1 clusters through the joint use of X-ray
and large, ground-based telescopes.",2005-02-28T21:17:14Z
"Infrared spectroscopy of Nova Cassiopeiae 1993 (V705 Cas). IV. A closer
  look at the dust","Nova Cassiopeiae 1993 (V705 Cas) was an archetypical dust-forming nova. It
displayed a deep minimum in the visual light curve, and spectroscopic evidence
for carbon, hydrocarbon and silicate dust. We report the results of fitting the
infrared spectral energy distribution with the DUSTY code, which we use to
determine the properties and geometry of the emitting dust. The emission is
well described as originating in a thin shell whose dust has a carbon:silicate
ratio of ~2:1 by number (1.26:1 by mass) and a relatively flat size
distribution. The 9.7micron and 18micron silicate features are consistent with
freshly-condensed dust and, while the lower limit to the grain size
distribution is not well constrained, the largest grains have dimensions
\~0.06micron; unless the grains in V705 Cas were anomalously small, the sizes
of grains produced in nova eruptions may previously have been overestimated in
novae with optically thick dust shells. Laboratory work by Grishko & Duley may
provide clues to the apparently unique nature of nova UIR features.",2005-04-25T15:34:40Z
Dynamic Meteorology at the Photosphere of HD 209458b,"We calculate the meteorology of the close-in transiting extrasolar planet HD
209458b using a global, three-dimensional atmospheric circulation model.
Dynamics are driven by perpetual irradiation of one hemisphere of this tidally
locked planet. The simulation predicts global temperature contrasts of ~500 K
at the photosphere and the development of a steady superrotating jet. The jet
extends from the equator to mid-latitudes and from the top model layer at 1
mbar down to 10 bars at the base of the heated region. Wind velocities near the
equator exceed 4 km/s at 300 mbar. The hottest regions of the atmosphere are
blown downstream from the substellar point by 60 degrees of longitude. We
predict from these results a factor of ~2 ratio between the maximum and minimum
observed radiation from the planet over a full orbital period, with peak
infrared emission preceding the time of the secondary eclipse by ~14 hours.",2005-02-23T14:57:11Z
"Radio Sources in Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei.IV. Radio
  Luminosity Function, Importance of Jet Power, and Radio Properties of the
  Complete Palomar Sample","We present the completed results of a high resolution radio imaging survey of
all (~200) low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) and AGNs in the
Palomar Spectroscopic Sample. The high incidences of pc-scale radio nuclei,
with T(brightness) >=10^7 K, and sub-parsec jets argue for accreting black
holes in >=50% of all LINERs and low-luminosity Seyferts; there is no evidence
against all LLAGNs being mini-AGNs. The radio luminosity function (RLF) of
Palomar Sample LLAGNs and AGNs extends three orders of magnitude below, and is
continuous with, that of `classical' AGNs. We find marginal evidence for a
low-power turnover in the RLF; nevertheless LLAGNs are responsible for a
significant fraction of present day mass accretion. Adopting the jet model of
Falcke & Biermann, we show that the accretion energy output in LLAGNs is
dominated by the energy in the observed jets rather than the radiated
bolometric luminosity. The Palomar LLAGNs and AGNs follow the same scaling
between jet power and narrow line region (NLR) luminosity as the pc to kpc jets
in powerful radio galaxies. Eddington ratios of <= 10^{-1} - 10^{-5} are
implied in jet models of the radio emission. We find evidence that, in analogy
to Galactic black hole candidates, LINERs are in a `low/hard' state (gas poor
nuclei, low Eddington ratio, ability to launch collimated jets) while
low-luminosity Seyferts are in a `high' state (gas rich nuclei, higher
Eddington ratio, less likely to launch collimated jets). The jets are
energetically more significant than supernovae in the LLAGN host galaxies, and
are potentially able to deposit sufficient energy into the innermost parsecs to
significantly slow the gas supply to the accretion disk.",2005-02-25T21:29:10Z
Instabilities of Galactic Disks in the Presence of Star Formation,"We discuss the stability of galactic disks in which the energy of
interstellar clouds is gained in encounters with expanding supernova remnants
and lost in inelastic collisions. Energy gain and loss processes introduce a
phase difference between the pressure and density perturbations, making disks
unstable on small scales for several recipes of star formation. This is in
contrast to the standard stability analysis in which small scale perturbations
are stabilized by pressure. In the limit of small scales the dispersion
relation for the growth rate reduces to that of thermal instabilities in a
fluid without gravity. If instabilities lead to star formation, then our
results imply a secondary mode of star formation which operates on small scales
and feeds on the existence of a primary mode on intermediate scales. This may
be interpreted as a positive feedback. Further, the standard stability
criterion on intermediate scales is significantly modified.",2005-03-02T14:33:38Z
"Evolution of the Near-Infrared Tully-Fisher Relation: Constraints on the
  Relationship Between the Stellar and Total Masses of Disk Galaxies since z=1","Using a combination of Keck spectroscopy and near-infrared imaging, we
investigate the K-band and stellar mass Tully-Fisher relation for 101 disk
galaxies at 0.2 < z < 1.2, with the goal of placing the first observational
constraints on the assembly history of halo and stellar mass. Our main result
is a lack of evolution in either the K-band or stellar mass Tully-Fisher
relation from z = 0 - 1.2. Furthermore, although our sample is not
statistically complete, we consider it suitable for an initial investigation of
how the fraction of total mass that has condensed into stars is distributed
with both redshift and total halo mass. We calculate stellar masses from
optical and near-infrared photometry and total masses from maximum rotational
velocities and disk scale lengths, utilizing a range of model relationships
derived analytically and from simulations. We find that the stellar/total mass
distribution and stellar-mass Tully-Fisher relation for z > 0.7 disks is
similar to that at lower redshift, suggesting that baryonic mass is accreted by
disks along with dark matter at z < 1, and that disk galaxy formation at z < 1
is hierarchical in nature. We briefly discuss the evolutionary trends expected
in conventional structure formation models and the implications of extending
such a study to much larger samples.",2005-03-28T21:01:05Z
The stellar populations of local dwarfs,"Recent progress in our knowledge of stellar populations in local dwarf
spheroidal galaxies is briefly discussed. A few results are summarized
including wide field observations of stellar populations and their spatial
variations, studies of AGB and variable stars, extension to near-infrared
wavelengths, and the interpretation effort based on synthetic color-magnitude
diagrams and chemical evolution models.",2005-06-09T11:59:06Z
Periodic Variability During the X-ray Decline of 4U 1636-53,"We report the onset of a large amplitude, statistically significant
periodicity (~46 d) in the RXTE/ASM data of the prototype X-ray burster 4U
1636-53, the X-ray flux of which has been gradually declining over the last
four years. This behaviour is remarkably similar to that observed in the
neutron star LMXB KS 1731-260, which is a long-term transient. We also report
on an INTEGRAL/IBIS observation of 4U 1636-53 during its decline phase, and
find that the hard X-ray flux (20-100 keV) indicates an apparent
anti-correlation with soft X-rays (2-12 keV). We argue that 4U 1636-53 is
transiting from activity to quiescence, as occurred in KS 1731-260. We also
suggest that the variability during the X-ray decline is the result of an
accretion rate variability related to the X-ray irradiation of the disc.",2005-05-10T13:56:38Z
"The Nature Of Radio Continuum Emission At Very Low Metallicity: Very
  Large Array Observations of I Zw 18","We present the first resolved study of the radio continuum properties of I Zw
18, the dwarf galaxy with the lowest known nebular metal abundance in the local
universe. New Very Large Array radio continuum images at 20 and 3.6 cm are
compared to various Hubble Space Telescope images, and we find a striking
morphological similarity between high-resolution H alpha and short wavelength
radio continuum emission, especially in the H alpha shell in the northwest
region. We separate thermal and nonthermal components of the emission, and find
a large synchrotron halo surrounding the galaxy. Comparison between H alpha and
X-band fluxes suggests that the emission at 3.6 cm is dominated by thermal
processes; an additional synchrotron component dominates the flux at 20 cm and
produces a modest fraction of the detected flux at 3.6 cm. The fluxes of three
of the four major emission peaks show a mix of thermal and nonthermal
processes, while one shows a nearly flat spectral index. The strong synchrotron
component argues for active star formation throughout the disk for at least the
last ~ 30 Myr. These sensitive observations provide a new, detailed view of the
nature of radio continuum emission in the very low metallicity interstellar
medium. Comparing with the literature, the role of metallicity in the evolution
of radio continuum emission seems to be secondary to other factors such as the
recent star formation history and the presence or absence of outflows from star
formation regions.",2005-02-03T07:07:49Z
"The Molecular Condensations Ahead of Herbig-Haro Objects. III. Radiative
  and dynamical perturbations of the HH 2 condensation","We have carried out an extensive observational study (from BIMA data) and
made a preliminary theoretical investigation of the molecular gas around HH2.
The molecular maps show a very complex morphological, kinematical and chemical
structure. The overall main conclusion of this work confirms the findings of
Paper I and II, by demonstrating that in addition to the strong photochemical
effects caused by penetration of the UV photons from HH2 into molecular cloud,
a range of complex radiative and dynamical interactions occur. Thus, despite
the apparent `quiescent' nature of the molecular cloud ahead of HH2, the
kinematical properties observed within the field of view suggest that it is
possibly being driven out by powerful winds from the VLA 1 protostar.",2005-04-15T13:41:58Z
Supernova search at intermediate z. II. Host galaxy morphology,"We discuss the host galaxy morphology of the 8 SNe discovered as a part of
the International Time Programme (ITP) project ``Omega and Lambda from
Supernovae, and the Physics of Supernovae Explosions'' at the European Northern
Observatory (ENO). Identification of the SN host galaxy types was done
exploiting both imaging and spectroscopy. A peculiar SNIa at z= 0.033 is found
in a spiral galaxy, as most other SNeIa with z between 0.1 and 0.4. A complete
account of these studies will be given elsewhere.",2005-02-20T23:55:08Z
"W Hya through the eye of Odin Satellite observations of circumstellar
  submillimetre H$_2$O line emission","We present Odin observations of the AGB star W Hya in the ground-state
transition of ortho-H2O, 1(10)-1(01), at 557GHz. The line is clearly of
circumstellar origin. Radiative transfer modelling of the water lines observed
by Odin and ISO results in a mass-loss rate of (2.5 +/- 0.5)E-7 Msol/yr, and a
circumstellar H2O abundance of (2.0 +/- 1.0)E-3. The inferred mass-loss rate is
consistent with that obtained from modelling the circumstellar CO radio line
emission, and also with that obtained from the dust emission modelling combined
with a dynamical model for the outflow. The very high water abundance, higher
than the cosmic oxygen abundance, can be explained by invoking an injection of
excess water from evaporating icy bodies in the system. The required extra mass
of water is quite small, on the order of ~ 0.1 earth mass.",2005-05-11T10:28:09Z
Star Formation and Chemical Evolution of DLAs with Semi-Analytical Model,"We have examined some basic properties of damped Ly$\alpha$ systems(DLAs) by
semi-analytic model. We assume that DLA hosts are disk galaxies whose mass
function is generated by Press-Schechter formulism at redshift 3. Star
formation and chemical evolution undergo in the disc. We select modelled DLAs
according to their observational criterion by Monte Carlo simulation using
random line of sights and disk inclinations. The DLA ages are set to be 1 to 3
Gyr. By best-fitting the predicted metallicity distribution to the observed
ones, we get the effective yield for DLAs about $0.25Z_{\odot}$. On the basis
of this constrain, we further compared our model predictions with observations
at redshift 3 in the following items: number density; gas content; HI frequency
distribution; star formation rate density; relationship between metallicity and
HI column density. We found that the predicted number density at redshift 3
agree well with the observed value, but the gas content $\Omega_{DLA}$ is about
3 times larger than observed since our model predicts more DLA systems with
higher column density. The frequency distribution at higher HI column density
is quite consistent with observation while some difference exists at lower HI
end. The predicted star formation rate density contributed by DLAs is
consistent with the most recent observations. Meanwhile, the connection between
DLAs and Lyman Break galaxies(LBGs) is discussed by comparing their UV
luminosity functions which shows that the DLAs host galaxies are much fainter
than LBGs. However, there is a discrepancy between model prediction and
observation in the correlation between metallicity and HI column density for
DLAs. Further investigations are needed for the star formation mode at high
redshift environments.",2005-05-08T02:32:55Z
Inflessence: a phenomenological model for inflationary quintessence,"We present a phenomenologically motivated model which is able to give rise
both to an inflationary epoch and to the present day cosmic acceleration. We
introduce an approach where the energy density depends on the scale factor $a$
in such a way that a smooth transition from the inflation to the matter
dominated era and then to the nowadays accelerated expansion is achieved. We
use the dimensionless coordinate distance $y(z)$ to the Gold Type Ia Supernovae
dataset and to a sample comprising 20 radio galaxies, the shift parameter
${\cal{R}}$ and the acoustic peak parameter ${\cal{A}}$ to test whether the
model is in agreement with observations and to constrain its main parameters.
As an independent cross check, we also compare model predictions with the
lookback time to galaxy clusters and the age of the universe. Although
phenomenologically inspired, the model may be theoretically motivated either
resorting to a scenario with a scalar and phantom fields (eventually
interacting) or as an effective description arising from higher order gravity
theories.",2005-06-16T07:21:46Z
Emission From Rotation-Powered Pulsars: Is It All Relative?,"Thirty-five years after the discovery of rotation-powered pulsars, we still
do not understand the fundamentals of their pulsed emission at any wavelength.
Even detailed pulse profiles cannot identify the location of the emission in a
magnetosphere that extends from the neutron star surface to near the light
cylinder. Compounding the problem are effects of strong gravity at low
altitudes and plasma moving at relativistic speeds in the outer magnetosphere.
I will discuss the role of special and general relativistic effects on pulsar
emission, from inertial frame-dragging near the stellar surface to aberration,
time-of-flight and retardation of the magnetic field near the light cylinder.
Understanding how these effects determine what we observe at different
wavelengths is critical to unraveling the emission physics.",2005-03-14T19:11:27Z
Air Cherenkov Methods in Cosmic Rays: A Review and Some History,"The history of application of the Cherenkov light emission in the atmosphere

and some new ideas are also discussed.",2005-04-12T13:08:13Z
Extra galactic sources of high energy neutrinos,"The main goal of the construction of large volume, high energy neutrino
telescopes is the detection of extra-Galactic neutrino sources. The existence
of such sources is implied by observations of ultra-high energy, >10^{19} eV,
cosmic-rays (UHECRs), the origin of which is a mystery. The observed UHECR flux
sets an upper bound to the extra-Galactic high energy neutrino intensity, which
implies that the detector size required to detect the signal in the energy
range of 1 TeV to 1 PeV is >=1 giga-ton, and much larger at higher energy.
Optical Cerenkov neutrino detectors, currently being constructed under ice and
water, are expected to achieve 1 giga-ton effective volume for 1 TeV to 1 PeV
neutrinos. Coherent radio Cerenkov detectors (and possibly large air-shower
detectors) will provide the >> 1 giga-ton effective volume required for
detection at ~10^{19} eV. Detection of high energy neutrinos associated with
electromagnetically identified sources will allow to identify the sources of
UHECRs, will provide a unique probe of the sources, which may allow to resolve
open questions related to the underlying physics of models describing these
powerful accelerators, and will provide information on fundamental neutrino
properties.",2005-02-08T10:03:27Z
"Can Dark Matter Annihilation Dominate the Extragalactic Gamma-Ray
  Background?","Annihilating dark matter (DM) has been discussed as a possible source of
gamma-rays from the galactic center (GC) and contributing to the extragalactic
gamma-ray background (EGB). Assuming universality of the density profile of DM
halos, we show that it is quite unlikely that DM annihilation is a main
constituent of EGB, without exceeding the observed gamma-ray flux from the GC.
This argument becomes stronger when we include enhancement of the density
profiles by supermassive black holes or baryon cooling. The presence of
substructure may loosen the constraint, but only if a very large cross section
as well as the rather flat profile are realized.",2005-03-01T03:38:11Z
"Atmospheric dynamics in carbon-rich Miras. I. Model atmospheres and
  synthetic line profiles","Atmospheres of evolved AGB stars are heavily affected by pulsation, dust
formation and mass loss, and they can become very extended. Time series of
observed high-resolution spectra proved to be a useful tool to study
atmospheric dynamics throughout the outer layers of these pulsating red giants.
Originating at various depths, different molecular spectral lines observed in
the near-infrared can be used to probe gas velocities there for different
phases during the lightcycle. Dynamic model atmospheres are needed to represent
the complicated structures of Mira variables properly. An important aspect
which should be reproduced by the models is the variation of line profiles due
to the influence of gas velocities. Based on a dynamic model, synthetic spectra
(containing CO and CN lines) were calculated, using an LTE radiative transfer
code that includes velocity effects. It is shown that profiles of lines that
sample different depths qualitatively reproduce the behaviour expected from
observations.",2005-03-30T12:31:47Z
ELT Observations of Supernovae at the Edge of the Universe,"We discuss the possibility of using Supernovae as tracers of the star
formation history of the Universe for the range of stellar masses $\sim 3-30$
M$_\odot$ and possibly beyond. We simulate the observations of 350 SNe, up to
$z\sim 15$, made with OWL (100m) telescope.",2005-04-05T10:18:15Z
"Testing the Universal Structured Jet Models of Gamma-Ray Bursts by BATSE
  Observations","Assuming that the observed gamma-ray burst (GRB) rate as a function of
redshift is proportional to a corrected star formation rate, we derive the
empirical distribution of the viewing angles of long BATSE GRBs, $P^{\rm
em}(\theta)$, and the distribution of these bursts in the plane of $\theta$
against redshift, $P^{\rm em}(\theta, z)$, by using a tight correlation between
$E_{\gamma}$) and $E_{\rm p}^{'}$). Our results show that $P^{\rm em}(\theta)$
is well fitted by a log-normal distribution centering at $\log \theta/{\rm
rad}=-0.76$ with a width of $\sigma_{\log \theta}=0.57$. We test different
universal structured jet models by comparing model predictions with our
empirical results. To make the comparisons reasonable, an ""effective""
threshold, which corresponds to the sample selection criteria of the long GRB
sample, is used. We find that the predictions of a two-Gaussian jet model are
roughly consistent with our empirical results. A brief discussion shows that
cosmological effect on the $E_{\gamma}-E_{\rm p}^{'}$ relation does not
significantly affect our results, but sample selection effects on this
relationship might significantly influence our results.",2005-04-18T03:04:40Z
"The optical counterpart of XTE J0929-314, the third transient
  millisecond X-ray pulsar","A blue and variable optical counterpart of the X-ray transient XTE J0929-314
was identified on 2002 May 1. We conducted frequent BVRI broadband photometry
on this object using the Mt Canopus 1-m telescope during May and June until it
had faded to below 21'st magnitude. Nearly continuous I band CCD photometry on
2002 May 2, 3 and 4 revealed a ~ 10 % sinusoidal modulation at the binary
period lasting ~ 6 cycles during the latter half of May 2. The phase indicates
that the modulation may be due to a combination of emission by a hot spot on
the disc and X-ray heating of the secondary. The emission generally trended
bluer with B-I decreasing by 0.6 magnitudes during the observations but there
were anomalous changes in colour during the first few days after optical
identification when the I band flux decreased slightly while fluxes in other
bands increased. Spectral analysis of the BVRI broadband photometry show
evidence of a variable excess in the R and I bands. We suggest that this may be
due to synchrotron emission in matter flowing out of the system and note that
similar processes may have been responsible for anomalous V and I band
measurements in 1998 of the persistent millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX
